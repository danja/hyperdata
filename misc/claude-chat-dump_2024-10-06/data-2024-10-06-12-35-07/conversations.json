Plug one or both in as soon as you arrive. Light a fire if you fancy reading a book or whatever. \nThe main thing Claudio will need is company (and food). Please give him lots of love.\n\nUnless you think he really needs a walk, don\u2019t bother. A week without isn\u2019t a big deal, I\u2019ll make it up to him when I get back. I\u2019m much more worried about him escaping. He doesn\u2019t understand traffic, there are the lunatic Mozzanella drivers.\nIf you (or Nino) do take him out, put his bright jacket on (kitchen door). Don\u2019t use the extending lead : it\u2019s not his strength that\u2019s the problem, it\u2019s when he runs unexpectedly and reaches the end of the lead with a sudden force. I find it really hard to keep hold sometimes and I\u2019m used to it. There\u2019s a rope lead on the door as well \u2013 use that, keep him close, no surprises. Keep your teeth.\n\nFood \nHis bowl is usually under the kitchen table. Croccantini are in a bin at the end of the balcony. Three of my handfuls, but maybe give him a little bit more, he\u2019ll just leave it for later if there\u2019s too much.\n\nOne tin of pate, kitchen cupboard. \n\nI usually give him one or two biscuits or whatever treats through the day. The thin stick treats are for Zampa Game.\n\nLast thing, a Denti Stix.\n\nThere\u2019s a water bucket under the kitchen table, a pan in the bidet.\n\nPoo\nHe will poop in the office. But unless you\u2019re feeling brave, just leave it, I\u2019ll do it when I get back (there are scooping tools in the yard, white bucket). I already need to give that floor a really good scrub but have been putting it off. A lot of the varnish has worn off, so when I do next get it properly clean I want to give it a coat of linseed oil.\n\nFridge\nProbably best if you take everything that\u2019s in the fridge and unplug it. I think it might need defrosting again anyway.\n\nWater\nIt\u2019s very low pressure because I\u2019ve switched the pump off. When I last did washing it didn\u2019t switch off properly. It probably dislodged something, caused a little drip. I\u2019ll fix it when I get back.\n\nPassword for computers is \u2018sasha\u2019, use as you want.\n\n\nThank You!!!!\n\n"}, {"file_name": "Claudio ecc Ci sono due.txt", "file_size": 2394, "file_type": "text/plain", "extracted_content": "Claudio ecc.\nCi sono due piccoli riscaldatori elettrici neri in giro (gli interruttori non funzionano su uno, devi solo usare la spina).

Non utilizzare l\u2019allungamento: non \u00e8 la sua forza il problema, \u00e8 quando corre inaspettatamente e arriva alla fine dell\u2019anticipo con una forza improvvisa. Trovo davvero difficile resistere a volte e ci sono abituato. C'\u00e8 anche una corda sulla porta: usala, tienilo vicino, senza sorprese. Tieni i denti.\n\nCibo\nLa sua ciotola \u00e8 solitamente sotto il tavolo della cucina. I Croccantini sono in un cestino in fondo al balcone. Tre delle mie manciate, ma forse dagliene un po' di pi\u00f9, lo lascer\u00e0 per dopo se \u00e8 troppo.\n\nUna scatola di pat\u00e8, nella credenza della cucina.\n\nDi solito gli do uno o due biscotti o qualunque dolcetto durante la giornata.

Ma a meno che tu non ti senta coraggioso, lascia perdere, lo far\u00f2 quando torno (ci sono gli attrezzi per scavare nel cortile, un secchio bianco). Ho gi\u00e0 bisogno di dare una bella strofinata a quel pavimento, ma ho rimandato. Gran parte della vernice si \u00e8 consumata, quindi quando la pulir\u00f2 adeguatamente, voglio darle una mano di olio di lino.\n\nFrigo\nProbabilmente \u00e8 meglio se prendi tutto quello che c'\u00e8 nel frigorifero e lo scolleghi. Penso che potrebbe comunque aver bisogno di essere nuovamente scongelato.\n\nAcqua\nLa pressione \u00e8 molto bassa perch\u00e9 ho spento la pompa. L'ultima volta che l'ho lavato non si \u00e8 spento correttamente. Probabilmente ha spostato qualcosa, causando un piccolo gocciolamento.

Steel wool stuffed in cracks works well.\n\n- Keep all human and pet food in sealed metal or glass containers so there's nothing for them to eat. Clean up all crumbs.\n\n- Use natural peppermint oil deterrents. Mice don't like the smell. \n\n- Consider adopting a cat - they can be great mousers without actually killing them. The mice may leave from the cat's presence and scent alone.\n\n- As a last resort if the mice are truly overrunning your home, contact a pest control company to explore options like relocation or humane deterrents.\n\nI hope these give you some ideas to humanely and safely evict the mice.

Conditional branching:\nThis allows the program to make decisions based on the current state. You could implement this by adding an if-else type of construct.

Looping or recursion:\nThis allows the program to repeat a set of operations, which is crucial for handling arbitrary amounts of data or computation. You could implement this with a WHILE loop or a recursive call. For example:\n\n```\nWHILE condition DO A B C\n```\n\nThis would repeatedly apply A(B(C(O))) as long as the condition is true.\n\nWith these additions, your system would become Turing complete, capable of computing anything that a Turing machine can compute.

In fact, forward-only conditional branching is sufficient to achieve Turing completeness, as long as you have the ability to loop or recurse. Here's why:\n\n1. Forward-only branching + looping:\nWith forward-only branching and the ability to loop, you can simulate backward jumps by wrapping your entire sequence in a loop and using forward jumps to \"restart\" the sequence. For example:\n\n```\nWHILE true DO\n  A\n  B\n  C\n  IF condition THEN CONTINUE\n  D\n  E\n  F\nEND WHILE\n```\n\nIn this structure, the `IF condition THEN CONTINUE` acts like a \"GOTO A\" by skipping the rest of the loop body and starting over from the beginning.\n\n2. Structured programming theorem:\nThis concept is formally supported by the structured programming theorem (also known as the B\u00f6hm-Jacopini theorem). It states that any algorithm can be expressed using just three control structures:\n\n- Sequence\n- Selection (if/then/else)\n- Iteration (while loops)\n\nNotably, this doesn't require arbitrary GOTO statements, which would allow backward jumps.\n\n3. Practical implementation:\nIn practice, forward-only branching is often preferred in programming languages because it's easier to reason about and less prone to creating \"spaghetti code\". Many modern languages (like Python, Java, etc.) don't even have a GOTO statement, yet they are Turing complete.\n\nSo, to answer your question directly: forward-only branching is indeed adequate to achieve Turing completeness, as long as you also have the ability to loop or recurse.

Let's explore these differences at both the architectural and bottom-level implementation levels:\n\nArchitectural Level:\n\n1. Core Architecture:\n   - Atom: Built on Electron, which combines Chromium and Node.js. It uses a package-based architecture where nearly everything is a package.\n   - VSCode: Also built on Electron, but uses a more modular architecture with a core editor and extensibility model.\n\n2. Extension System:\n   - Atom: Packages are deeply integrated into the core. Almost every feature is a package, including core functionalities.\n   - VSCode: Uses a cleaner separation between the core editor and extensions. The core is more monolithic, with extensions adding functionality on top.\n\n3. UI Framework:\n   - Atom: Uses its own UI framework called Atom-Shell (later renamed to Electron).\n   - VSCode: Uses a custom UI framework built on top of Electron, with more native-like performance optimizations.\n\n4. Language Support:\n   - Atom: Primarily written in CoffeeScript (later transitioned to JavaScript) and Less for styling.\n   - VSCode: Primarily written in TypeScript, which offers stronger typing and better tooling support.\n\nBottom-level Implementation:\n\n1. Text Buffer Implementation:\n   - Atom: Uses a custom text buffer implementation with a piece table data structure.\n   - VSCode: Uses a highly optimized text buffer implementation based on a piece tree data structure, which provides better performance for large files.\n\n2. Rendering:\n   - Atom: Relies more heavily on DOM for rendering, which can lead to performance issues with large files.\n   - VSCode: Uses a custom rendering engine (Monaco) that minimizes DOM usage, resulting in better performance, especially for large files.\n\n3. File Watching:\n   - Atom: Uses Pathwatcher, a native Node.js module for file system events.\n   - VSCode: Uses a combination of native file system watchers and intelligent polling, with optimizations for different operating systems.\n\n4. Search Implementation:\n   - Atom: Primarily uses ripgrep for searching, integrated later in its lifecycle.\n   - VSCode: Has used ripgrep from earlier on, with deeper integration and optimizations.\n\n5. Process Model:\n   - Atom: Single-process model where extensions run in the same process as the core editor.\n   - VSCode: Multi-process model where extensions can run in separate processes, improving stability and performance isolation.\n\n6. Language Server Protocol (LSP) Integration:\n   - Atom: Added LSP support later through community packages.\n   - VSCode: Built with LSP support from the ground up, offering tighter integration and better performance.\n\n7. Git Integration:\n   - Atom: Git functionality is provided through packages.\n   - VSCode: Has a deeply integrated Git experience built into the core.\n\n8. Performance Optimizations:\n   - Atom: Less focus on performance optimizations, especially in later stages of development.\n   - VSCode: Heavy focus on performance, with continuous optimizations for startup time, memory usage, and responsiveness.\n\nThese differences reflect the different design philosophies and evolution of the two editors. Atom's highly package-based architecture offered great flexibility but sometimes at the cost of performance and complexity. VSCode's more modular approach with a strong core and extension model has allowed for better performance optimizations and a more consistent user experience.\n\nIt's worth noting that Atom's development was officially discontinued by GitHub (owned by Microsoft) in December 2022, with the team focusing their efforts on GitHub Codespaces and VSCode. This decision was partly due to the significant overlap between Atom and VSCode, and VSCode's growing popularity and performance advantages.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-13T09:24:03.104076Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-13T09:24:03.104076Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "1adda42f-87c1-47d9-8fb6-1bdc5c093495", "name": "Paying a Hundredth: The Centesimal", "created_at": "2024-09-12T13:09:06.043520Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-12T13:17:01.148477Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "cdad090f-b0c5-4d75-8ef5-f29b5bea3753", "text": " Paying a hundredth (1/100 or 1%) would be called a \"centesimal\" if we were to follow a similar naming convention as \"tithe.\"\n\nThe word \"tithe\" comes from an Old English word meaning \"tenth.\" While \"centesimal\" isn't commonly used in religious or financial contexts like \"tithe\" is, it's the mathematically correct term for a hundredth part.\n\nIn practical usage, a payment of 1% might simply be referred to as \"one percent\" or a \"percentage\" rather than having a specific term like tithe.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-12T13:09:12.669635Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-12T13:09:12.669635Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "7ae3ffaa-2d3d-4cc3-83fc-8e4fb956d9e0", "text": "if a tithe is paying a tenth to the church, what would paying a hundredth be?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-12T13:09:12.669635Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-12T13:09:12.669635Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "f7e531a6-ae39-46f7-96fa-1c012376daa2", "text": "how would you form a verb from centesimal, comparable with 'to tithe a person'?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-12T13:10:32.318556Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-12T13:10:32.318556Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "849fd503-1c77-4764-9198-a8658995d90f", "text": " To form a verb from \"centesimal\" that's comparable to \"to tithe,\" we would use the process of back-formation.

It should provide more information about what `processProperty` is actually returning.\n\nBased on the output, we may need to adjust the `processProperty` function in `form-a-matic.js`. Here's a possible correction:\n\n```javascript\nexport const processProperty = (predicate, path) => {\n  const objects = predicate.out().terms;\n  const predicateName = predicate.term.value.split('/').pop(); // Extract the last part of the URI\n  if (objects.some(obj => obj.value === '#URI' || obj.termType === 'NamedNode')) {\n    return createField(predicateName, path, 'uri');\n  }\n  if (objects.some(obj => obj.value === 'LITERAL' || obj.termType === 'Literal')) {\n    return createField(predicateName, path, 'literal');\n  }\n  return '';\n};\n```\n\nThis version of `processProperty` should handle both the placeholder values ('#URI', 'LITERAL') and actual RDF terms (NamedNode for URI, Literal for literal values).\n\nAfter making these changes, try running the test again:\n\n```\nnode src/fam-test.js\n```\n\nIf the test still fails, please provide the output, including the console.log of the `processProperty` result, and I'll help you debug further.\n\nQ1: How can we make our tests more resilient to different RDF serializations and naming conventions?\nQ2: Should we add more specific tests for different types of RDF terms (NamedNode, Literal, BlankNode)?\nQ3: How can we improve our error messages to make debugging easier in the future?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-11T17:40:03.725313Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-11T17:40:03.725313Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "4a7cfc8c-77c1-407e-9d1c-85f95c6a5a80", "text": "please give me a function that can serialise the output of createMockGraph to a Turtle string", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-11T17:54:44.873271Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-11T17:54:44.873271Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "268684ec-5c79-47d6-98b1-2aea3928f5a6", "text": " Certainly!

Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Wake-on-LAN setup:\n   - Ensure your desktop's network card supports WoL and it's enabled in the BIOS.\n   - Configure your desktop to keep the network card powered on when the system is off.\n\n2. Find your desktop's MAC address and local IP:\n   - Open a terminal on your desktop and run: `ifconfig` or `ip addr`\n   - Note down the MAC address and local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)\n\n3. Router configuration:\n   a) WoL port forwarding:\n      - Forward UDP port 9 (standard WoL port) to your desktop's IP address\n   \n   b) SSH port forwarding:\n      - Forward TCP port 22 (standard SSH port) to your desktop's IP address\n   \n   c) (Optional) Use a non-standard port for SSH:\n      - For better security, you can use a non-standard port (e.g., 2222) and forward it to port 22 on your desktop\n\n4. Configure your router's Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service:\n   - This gives you a domain name that always points to your home's public IP address\n\n5. On your remote server:\n   a) To wake up your desktop:\n      - Install a WoL tool (e.g., `wakeonlan` or `etherwake`)\n      - Use the command: `wakeonlan -i your_home_public_ip_or_ddns MAC_ADDRESS`\n\n   b) To SSH into your desktop:\n      - Wait a minute for the desktop to boot up\n      - SSH using: `ssh username@your_home_public_ip_or_ddns -p 22` (or your custom port)\n\nHere are some additional considerations:\n\n1. Security: \n   - Use strong passwords and consider key-based authentication for SSH.\n   - Consider using a VPN instead of port forwarding for added security.\n\n2. Router specific:\n   - The exact steps for port forwarding vary by router. Check your router's manual or online guides.\n\n3. Firewall:\n   - Ensure your desktop's firewall allows incoming connections on the SSH port.\n\n4. Testing:\n   - Test your setup from within your home network first, then from outside.\n\n5. IP address changes:\n   - If your home IP changes frequently, make sure to keep your DDNS updated.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this setup?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-13T18:26:50.933202Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-13T18:26:50.933202Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "ae5a4f66-fe03-477f-846a-d9a5c4023116", "text": "Ubuntu networking question.

This approach can indeed improve your development experience when you can't use TypeScript directly. Here's a breakdown of how you would implement this in practice:\n\n1. JSDoc Type Annotations:\n   You use JSDoc comments to add type information to your JavaScript code. These comments start with `/**` and end with `*/`.\n\n2. Variable and Function Annotations:\n   You can annotate variables and functions with their expected types.\n\n   For example:\n\n   ```javascript\n   /** @type {string} */\n   let name = \"Claude\";\n\n   /**\n    * @param {number} a\n    * @param {number} b\n    * @returns {number}\n    */\n   function add(a, b) {\n     return a + b;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Complex Types:\n   You can define more complex types using JSDoc tags.\n\n   ```javascript\n   /**\n    * @typedef {Object} Person\n    * @property {string} name\n    * @property {number} age\n    */\n\n   /** @type {Person} */\n   const person = { name: \"Alice\", age: 30 };\n   ```\n\n4. IDE Integration:\n   Many modern IDEs (like Visual Studio Code) can recognize these JSDoc comments and provide type checking, autocompletion, and other TypeScript-like features.\n\n5. Type Checking:\n   You can use tools like TypeScript compiler (in check-only mode) or other static analysis tools to perform type checking based on these JSDoc comments.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of using JSDoc for type checking in JavaScript?

Here's an overview:\n\n1. Order of precedence:\n   - Generally, more specific rules take precedence over more general rules.\n   - Later rules usually override earlier rules.\n\n2. Pattern matching:\n   - Asterisk (*) matches any number of characters except slashes.\n   - Double asterisk (**) matches any number of characters including slashes.\n   - Question mark (?) matches a single character except a slash.\n   - Square brackets ([abc]) match any one character inside the brackets.\n\n3. Directory indicators:\n   - A slash (/) at the end of a pattern indicates a directory.\n   - A slash at the beginning of a pattern indicates the root of the project.\n\n4. Negation:\n   - An exclamation mark (!) at the beginning of a pattern negates it, meaning \"don't ignore\" in .gitignore or \"do include\" in package.json.\n\n5. Comments:\n   - Lines starting with # are treated as comments.\n\n6. Empty lines:\n   - Empty lines are ignored.\n\n7. Case sensitivity:\n   - Patterns are usually case-sensitive, but this can depend on the operating system.\n\nHere's how these conventions typically apply in .gitignore and package.json:\n\n.gitignore:\n- Each line specifies a pattern for files or directories to ignore.\n- Negation with ! can be used to explicitly include files that would otherwise be ignored.\n\npackage.json (in the \"files\" field):\n- Specifies which files should be included when the package is published.\n- If not specified, it defaults to including all files except those ignored by .gitignore.\n- The \"files\" field acts as a whitelist, while .npmignore (if present) acts as a blacklist.\n\nIt's worth noting that while these conventions are common, the exact behavior can vary between different systems and tools. For the most accurate information, it's always best to consult the specific documentation for the tool you're using.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these conventions?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-07T10:54:55.007879Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-07T10:54:55.007879Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "7b5afdb2-8dbe-42c8-8ba5-d227c0280a0c", "text": "is it blacklist first then whitelist, or vice versa?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-08-07T10:55:46.741098Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-07T10:55:46.741098Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "91fb27d8-65a5-4c47-a076-20b036a656ca", "text": " The order of application between blacklists and whitelists can vary depending on the specific system, but there's a general principle that's commonly followed:\n\n1. Blacklist (exclude) is typically applied first.\n2. Whitelist (include) is then applied to the remaining set.\n\nThis order is logical because:\n\n1. First, you remove everything you don't want (blacklist).\n2. Then, from what's left, you specify what you do want (whitelist).\n\nHowever, it's important to note some specifics:\n\n1. In .gitignore:\n   - It's primarily a blacklist system.\n   - The ! (negation) acts as a kind of whitelist within the blacklist.\n   - Rules are processed top to bottom, with later rules overriding earlier ones.\n\n2. In package.json:\n   - The \"files\" field acts as a whitelist.\n   - If both package.json \"files\" and .npmignore exist, .npmignore is applied first (as a blacklist), then the \"files\" whitelist is applied.\n\n3. Some systems might apply whitelist first, then blacklist. This is less common but does exist in some specialized scenarios.\n\nThe exact behavior can depend on the specific tool or system you're using. For critical applications, it's always best to test the behavior or consult the official documentation of the specific tool you're working with.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on how this works in any particular system?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-07T10:55:46.741098Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-07T10:55:46.741098Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "6415ebaa-216d-4283-b9a5-ace822f7cc98", "text": "if a value under test matches an entry in both include and exclude, what happens?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-08-07T11:13:53.653285Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-07T11:13:53.653285Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "013a8f96-22b2-413c-a6a7-f4d8d49a60f2", "text": " When a value matches entries in both include and exclude lists, the outcome typically depends on a few factors:\n\n1. Order of rules\n2. Specificity of rules\n3. The particular system being used\n\nHere's a general breakdown:\n\n1. Last rule wins:\n   In many systems, the rule that appears last in the configuration takes precedence. So if you have:\n   \n   ```\n   exclude: *.txt\n   include: important.txt\n   ```\n   \n   Then \"important.txt\" would be included, despite matching the exclude pattern.\n\n2. Specificity:\n   More specific rules often override more general ones. For example:\n   \n   ```\n   exclude: docs/*\n   include: docs/README.md\n   ```\n   \n   Here, \"docs/README.md\" would likely be included because it's more specific than the general \"docs/*\" exclude rule.\n\n3. System-specific behavior:\n   - Git: In .gitignore, the last matching rule is always used, regardless of whether it's an include (!) or exclude.\n   - npm: When using both package.json \"files\" and .npmignore, .npmignore (exclude) is applied first, then \"files\" (include) is applied to the result.\n\n4. Explicit precedence:\n   Some systems have explicit ways to mark certain rules as taking precedence, often through syntax or ordering conventions.\n\nGiven the variability between systems, here are some best practices:\n\n1. Avoid having the same file or pattern in both include and exclude lists if possible.\n2. Be as specific as possible with your rules to avoid ambiguity.\n3. Test your configuration to ensure it behaves as expected.\n4. Consult the documentation for the specific tool you're using.\n\nFor critical applications or when in doubt, it's always best to test the behavior in your specific environment and with your particular configuration.\n\nWould you like me to provide an example of how this might work in a specific system?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-07T11:13:53.653285Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-07T11:13:53.653285Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "9e1b8132-f28b-4e3b-b709-9879787135b2", "name": "Strategies for Focused, Quality-Driven Productivity", "created_at": "2024-08-06T10:35:53.492892Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-06T10:36:05.913181Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "55a7a759-b49a-44f3-b4ff-20cc8507fb4a", "text": "Extract the main ideas and make a list of the individual suggestions in the following, with a one line description for each.\nSkip to main content\nNature\nSearch\nLog in\ncontent\nAbout\nPublish\ncareer feature  article\nDownload PDF\nCAREER FEATURE\n05 August 2024\nSlow productivity worked for Marie Curie \u2014 here\u2019s why you should adopt it, too\nDo fewer things, work at a natural pace and obsess over quality, says computer scientist Cal Newport, in his latest time-management book.\nBy Anne Gulland\nTwitter Facebook Email\nDownload PDF\nBlack and white photo of Marie Curie standing in her laboratory surrounded by scientific instruments on tables\nMarie Curie\u2019s research straddled many decades and involved periods of rest and reflection in the French countryside.Credit: H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty\n\nSara, a university professor, describes a typical working day for her as including a barrage of \u201cback-and-forth e-mails, Slack, last-minute Zoom meetings\u201d. These, she says, \u201cprevent me \u2014 and everyone in general, I feel \u2014 from actually having the time to do deep work, think, write, with high quality\u201d.\n\nHer lot, recounted in Cal Newport\u2019s book Slow Productivity (2024), is one that will be shared by many of her academic peers and other \u2018knowledge workers\u2019, the term Newport uses for people whose working day is spent largely thinking about problems and how to resolve them, rather than making a product or directly serving people.\n\nSlow Productivity is a call to arms to reject the performative busyness of the modern workplace, where frequent virtual meetings and long e-mail chains sap so much of workers\u2019 attention. One exhausted postdoctoral researcher interviewed by Newport defined productivity, as it is currently measured in academia, as \u201cworking all the time\u201d.\n\nNewport, whose day job is as a computer science at Georgetown University in Washington DC, says that the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in home working has accelerated a shift towards what he and other workplace commentators term pseudo-productivity or pseudo-activity \u2014 rattling through a lengthy to-do list rather than focusing on tasks that require deeper thinking and reflection.\n\n\nScience must protect thinking time in a world of instant communication\n\n\u201cThat, combined with the front-office IT revolution \u2014 personal computers, then portable computers with e-mail and networks, and then smartphones \u2014 meant that things really began to spin out of control for knowledge workers and the toll of exhaustion and burnout have begun to increase,\u201d he adds.\n\nInstead, Newport urges knowledge workers to \u201cdo fewer things. Work at a natural pace. Obsess over quality.\u201d Psychologist Megan Rogers tries to apply this advice, although not always successfully. A fan of Newport\u2019s work, she spent a year tracking her time on a spreadsheet before starting a faculty position at Texas State University in San Marcos. \u201cI try to put no more than five things on my daily to-do list but often get flooded with other, more urgent tasks,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I do generally succeed in working at a more natural pace rather than feeling as though I\u2019m rushing. Having flexible working hours helps here. I tend to follow my energy as much as possible, rather than forcing tasks into specific slots of time.\u201d\n\nLearning from the greats\nNewport\u2019s book is full of examples of academics and other knowledge workers who have taken radical steps to free themselves from distractions in their quest to produce great work.\n\nPoet and author Maya Angelou, for example, would write in a hotel room with all the artwork removed so that she could focus on her writing. Theoretical physicist Richard Feynman avoided doing committee work and other commitments to focus on the deep thinking his research required. Feynman thought that peace of mind was the most important requisite of creative work, according to his friend and former colleague, computer scientist Stephen Wolfram. In a 2005 talk, Wolfram recalled Feynman\u2019s conviction that \u201cone should always stay away from anything worldly, like management\u201d.\n\n\nHow to manage your time as a researcher\n\nNewport acknowledges that most of us are not like Feynman \u2014 people cannot simply ignore their supervisors\u2019 demands while thinking great thoughts. He thinks that academics are prime examples of how work has shifted in recent decades.\n\n\u201cMy grandfather was a professor and didn\u2019t own a computer. But his goal was the same as a professor today: to produce books and articles. He produced a ton of books and was very productive. So what have we gained in the twenty-first century, when professors now also send and receive 100 e-mails a day?\u201d he says.\n\nSlow Productivity is Newport\u2019s eighth book. It builds on his previous writing on the dangers of digital distractions, including A World Without Email (2021) and Deep Work: Rules for Success in a Distracted World (2016).\n\nIn his weekly podcast, which launched in 2020, he answers listeners\u2019 questions and talks in depth about his ideas on productivity, concentration and distractions. As well as being a book about ideas, Slow Productivity includes practical tips, such as blocking out time in your day when you don\u2019t look at your e-mails (See \u2018Seven ways to practise slow productivity in the lab\u2019).\n\nSeven ways to practise slow productivity in the lab\nCal Newport, a computer scientist at Georgetown University in Washington DC, writes books about time management. Here are some of his tips, along with responses by psychologist Megan Rogers, based at Texas State University in San Marcos, who tried three of his suggestions.\n\nLimit daily goals\nNewport recommends working on, and obsessing about, one large project a day rather than switching back and forth between multiple big tasks. This is something Newport learnt from computer scientist Nancy Lynch, his doctoral adviser at MIT.\n\nMegan Rogers: Trying to task-batch goals and projects on specific days (or even portions of days) has been extremely helpful to me. I try to schedule student mentorship meetings back-to-back on a couple of days, teaching tasks on a different day and reserve one full day for deep research work (generally focused on one or two papers) without any interruptions. I\u2019m a big advocate of minimizing task-switching as much as possible.\n\nCombine rituals and locations\nThis will help to develop a regular \u2018autopilot\u2019 pattern. Newport cites an academic who, after Friday lunch in the university canteen, chooses the same library booth to work through grant reports before heading back to her office with a coffee.\n\nIntroduce docket-clearing team meetings\nHave a fixed, weekly meeting to work through pending tasks that require collaboration or clarification, all logged in a shared document. One 30-minute session can save hours of back-and-forth e-mails, says Newport.\n\nTake your time\nNotable scientists Nicolaus Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, Isaac Newton and Marie Curie helped to shape the modern scientific enterprise, but the pace at which they worked straddled many decades and involved periods of rest and reflection. Like them, allow your most important work to evolve over a sustainable timeline at various levels of intensity.\n\nCraft a five-year or similar long-term plan for major goals\nNewport did so during his doctorate, and it enabled him to pursue a writing career alongside his academic interests, giving him the space to experiment, for example with different writing styles.\n\nM.R.: I have done this loosely for key goals and milestones, but it\u2019s a challenge to get more specific than that. You never know what opportunities might arise and change your plans in the meantime.\n\nDon\u2019t schedule meetings on Mondays\nIt will help you to ease back into work after the weekend and make Sunday evenings more enjoyable.\n\nM.R.: This is excellent advice but it doesn\u2019t need to be Monday; rather, it could be any day that makes sense for the individual. I sometimes actually like having some of my meetings on Mondays or early in the week to be able to plan and delegate tasks to the team for the week.\n\nInvest in high-quality tools\nAs a postdoctoral researcher in 2010, Newport bought a US$50 notebook to record lab experiments, thinking that the high-end product made him more structured and careful in his thinking. He recently flipped through it and realized that it contained the seeds of seven peer-reviewed publications.\n\n\u201cA big thing I tried to do in the book is figure out how you can leverage the autonomy you have and how you organize your labour to get away from the worst excesses of super productivity. You can\u2019t say no to a lot of things. But you can have a more transparent workload management system so your boss can see you\u2019re doing all the things you\u2019re being asked to do,\u201d he says.\n\nFrom student to teacher\nIt was during his time as a computer science undergraduate at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, that Newport had the idea for his first book, on how to succeed at university.\n\nHe got advice from a literary-agent friend and ended up with a US$40,000 advance for How to Win at College (2005).\n\nHe then wrote How to be a Straight-A Student (2006), which has sold around a quarter of a million copies, and How to be a High School Superstar (2010).\n\nWhen he graduated from Dartmouth in 2004, he realized that he wanted a career that would give him the flexibility to continue writing \u2014 so he rejected job offers from technology firms and instead began graduate studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. There, he gained his master\u2019s and then his doctorate in 2009, for research focused on distributed algorithms \u2014 the study of what happens when an algorithm runs on different networks and processors. His adviser at MIT, Nancy Lynch, an engineering and computer scientist, was one of the people who defined the field. They have continued to collaborate.\n\nPortrait of Cal Newport photographed in front of some bookshelves\nComputer scientist Cal Newport writes books on work in the digital age.Credit: Penny Gray Photography\n\nAt MIT, Newport joined the theory of computation group \u2014 a collection of individuals he describes as \u201cpreposterous\u201d because of their prodigious achievements.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing a screenwriter would make up,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the other new doctoral students was 16 and had already been out of university for two years working for Microsoft. There was a professor who had just turned 21 and had won a MacArthur Genius Grant at 18 for solving this long-standing theorem,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt was super autonomous, super entrepreneurial. We were told to go and find people, have smart ideas and publish,\u201d he adds.\n\nIt was among these geniuses that Newport\u2019s ideas on the importance of concentration and focus were seeded.\n\n\u201cI learnt great lessons about the importance of concentration. The students had a distrust of digital technology versus the human brain. These are computer scientists who don\u2019t use computers,\u201d he says, adding, \u201cThese ideas infused my thinking.

Gosztyla is a recent PhD graduate from the University of California, San Diego, who has written about her own time-management tools and techniques, and has read most of Newport\u2019s books, including Slow Productivity. \u201cNewport is a theoretician, so his research schedule is entirely within his control; my stem cells don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a weekend, they still need to be fed,\u201d she says.\n\n\nTime management for scientists\n\nAlthough maintaining a regular schedule isn\u2019t always feasible for experimentalists, it\u2019s still something to strive for, she adds. \u201cWhen I have an unavoidable long day of experiments, or need to maintain cells over the weekend, I try to schedule some lighter days the following week to compensate.\u201d\n\nShe continues: \u201cThe irregularity of experimental work also emphasizes the importance of maintaining rituals wherever possible, particularly for reading papers and other low-urgency tasks that could otherwise slip through the cracks.\u201d\n\nGosztyla says that, for her thesis, she specifically sought out a laboratory that would give her the freedom to set her own hours. Also, ruthlessly trimming her to-do list opens up the mental space necessary to think about her science and experiments.\n\n\u201cI believe academia would be a healthier, more productive space if more mentors encouraged this mindset,\u201d she says.\n\nRogers highlights academia\u2019s obsession with quantity and publication metrics as a potential systemic barrier to implementing Newport\u2019s philosophy, but also argues that quantity and quality are correlated. \u201cThe more you do something, the higher quality you tend to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cObviously, this isn\u2019t necessarily the case for everyone or everything, but I\u2019ve noticed it at least in my own work.\u201d", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-08-06T10:36:04.864043Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-06T10:36:04.864043Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "6971d362-ad60-49a6-9d66-168513d43761", "text": " Here are the main ideas and individual suggestions extracted from the article, with a one-line description for each:\n\nMain Ideas:\n1.

The key issue here is:\n\n```\nCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:143 (find_package):\n  By not providing \"FindQt.cmake\" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked\n  CMake to find a package configuration file provided by \"Qt\", but CMake did\n  not find one.\n```\n\nThis error suggests that CMake cannot find the Qt library, which is a dependency for this project. To resolve this, you need to ensure that Qt is installed on your system and that CMake can locate it. Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Install Qt:\n   If you haven't already, install Qt on your Ubuntu system. You can do this using the package manager:\n\n   ```\n   sudo apt-get install qt5-default\n   ```\n\n2. Set the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:\n   If Qt is installed but CMake can't find it, you might need to set the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH. You can do this when running cmake:\n\n   ```\n   cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/qt\n   ```\n\n   Replace `/path/to/qt` with the actual path where Qt is installed on your system. It's often something like `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5`.\n\n3. Install Qt development files:\n   Sometimes, you need to install additional Qt development files. Try:\n\n   ```\n   sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev\n   ```\n\n4. Clear the build directory and try again:\n   If you've made changes, it's a good idea to clear the build directory before trying again:\n\n   ```\n   rm -rf build\n   cmake -B build\n   ```\n\nIf you're still having trouble after trying these steps, you might need to provide more information about your Qt installation and the specific version of samplv1 you're trying to build.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-06T00:50:34.256678Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-06T00:50:34.256678Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "43cbce6a-650b-47da-9cb4-280ca0f354de", "text": " It looks like the build system is now able to find Qt6, but it's missing a specific component: Qt6Svg. This component is needed for SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) support. Here's how you can resolve this issue:\n\n1. Install the Qt6 SVG component:\n   On Ubuntu, you can install this component using apt:\n\n   ```\n   sudo apt-get install libqt6svg6-dev\n   ```\n\n   This package should provide the missing Qt6Svg component.\n\n2. If the above doesn't work, you might need to install the full Qt6 development package:\n\n   ```\n   sudo apt-get install qt6-base-dev\n   ```\n\n3. After installing the necessary packages, clear your build directory and try the cmake command again:\n\n   ```\n   rm -rf build\n   cmake -B build\n   ```\n\n4. If you're still having issues, you can use the debug options mentioned in the error message to get more information:\n\n   ```\n   cmake -B build --debug-find-pkg=Qt6Svg\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```\n   cmake -B build -DQT_DEBUG_FIND_PACKAGE=ON\n   ```\n\n   These options will provide more detailed output about why CMake can't find the Qt6Svg component.\n\n5. Make sure your system is up to date:\n\n   ```\n   sudo apt-get update\n   sudo apt-get upgrade\n   ```\n\n   Sometimes, package conflicts can occur if your system isn't fully updated.\n\nIf you're still encountering issues after trying these steps, it would be helpful to see the full CMake output with the debug options enabled. This could provide more clues about why the Qt6Svg component isn't being found.\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-06T00:53:20.576041Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-06T00:53:20.576041Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "a942eea2-7f2a-40b5-b2a4-5415ca6815ca", "name": "What Italians Call a Square Scarf", "created_at": "2024-08-04T21:15:03.982122Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-04T21:15:09.311151Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "d0af61ab-4870-4895-9303-3dec364a74ee", "text": "What would an Italian call a scarf that's simply a square of cotton?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-08-04T21:15:08.509688Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-04T21:15:08.509688Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "c9fe1caf-aaf6-413f-958f-a03192599167", "text": " An Italian would likely call this type of scarf a \"foulard\" (pronounced foo-LAR). \n\nThe term \"foulard\" is derived from French but is commonly used in Italian to describe a square scarf, typically made of silk or lightweight materials like cotton.

You could create a simple HTML file with a basic message.\n\n2. favicon.ico: While not typically used for testing, it's a common file that browsers request.\n\n3. robots.txt: This file is used to provide instructions to web crawlers, but it's also a lightweight file often used for quick checks.\n\n4. health.html or status.html: These aren't standard, but they're sometimes used for health checks in more complex setups.\n\n5. ping.html or test.html: Simple, descriptive names for test files.\n\nHere's what I'd recommend:\n\n1. Create a simple index.html file in each domain's root directory. For example:\n\nFor /home/www/hyperdata.it/index.html:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>hyperdata.it test page</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>hyperdata.it is working!</h1>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nFor /home/github/hyperdata/docs/ps.hyperdata.it/public/home/index.html:\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>ps.hyperdata.it test page</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>ps.hyperdata.it is working!</h1>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n2. You can test these with a simple GET request:\n\n```\ncurl https://hyperdata.it\ncurl https://ps.hyperdata.it\n```\n\nThese commands should return the HTML content of the respective index.html files.\n\n3. If you prefer an even simpler test file, you could create a file named test.txt in each root directory with just a simple message:\n\n```\necho \"hyperdata.it test file\" > /home/www/hyperdata.it/test.txt\necho \"ps.hyperdata.it test file\" > /home/github/hyperdata/docs/ps.hyperdata.it/public/home/test.txt\n```\n\nThen test with:\n\n```\ncurl https://hyperdata.it/test.txt\ncurl https://ps.hyperdata.it/test.txt\n```\n\nThese conventions allow for quick and easy testing of your domain configurations.

It was introduced to Britain, likely in the late Middle Ages or early modern period. While the exact date of introduction is uncertain, most sources agree that it was brought to Britain sometime between the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nSome key points about its introduction:\n\n1. The earliest confirmed record of sycamore in Britain dates to 1578, when it was mentioned in a plant list by botanist Henry Lyte.\n\n2. It's believed that the tree may have been introduced earlier, possibly in the 15th century, but concrete evidence for this is lacking.\n\n3. The sycamore was likely introduced for ornamental purposes in parks and estates.\n\n4. After its introduction, the sycamore spread rapidly and naturalized across much of Britain and Ireland.

It's particularly well-suited for digital note-taking systems like Obsidian. PARA stands for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. Here's a breakdown of each component:\n\n1. Projects:\n   - These are short-term efforts in your work or life that you're committed to finishing.\n   - They have a defined outcome and a deadline.\n   - Examples: Complete a work report, plan a vacation, write a blog post.\n   - In Obsidian, you might have a \"Projects\" folder with subfolders for each active project.\n\n2. Areas:\n   - These represent ongoing responsibilities in your life that require maintenance over time.\n   - They don't have a specific end date but are spheres of activity with standards to be maintained.\n   - Examples: Health, finances, professional development, hobbies.\n   - In Obsidian, you could have an \"Areas\" folder with notes or subfolders for each area of responsibility.\n\n3. Resources:\n   - This category is for topic-based materials that may be useful for future reference.\n   - These are items you're interested in or want to keep for potential future use.\n   - Examples: Book notes, articles, quotes, ideas, techniques.\n   - In Obsidian, a \"Resources\" folder could contain notes on various topics, easily searchable and linkable.\n\n4. Archives:\n   - This is where you store items from the other three categories that are no longer active or relevant.\n   - It includes completed projects, areas you're no longer focusing on, or resources you no longer need quick access to.\n   - The archive serves as a record of your past activities and knowledge.\n   - In Obsidian, an \"Archives\" folder keeps your main workspace uncluttered while retaining all information.\n\nImplementation in Obsidian:\n- You can create top-level folders for each PARA category.\n- Use Obsidian's linking feature to connect related notes across categories.\n- Leverage tags to add another layer of organization within this structure.\n- Utilize Obsidian's search functionality to quickly find information across your PARA system.\n- Regular reviews help move items between categories as your projects and focus areas evolve.\n\nThe PARA method in Obsidian allows for a flexible, action-oriented organization of your notes and projects. It helps separate actionable items from reference materials and maintains a clear structure for both short-term projects and long-term areas of focus.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on how to set up PARA in Obsidian or discuss how it integrates with other Obsidian features?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-02T14:59:19.666422Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T14:59:19.666422Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "bf86e7be-5b63-4535-ba35-15605ba34509", "text": "How do backlinks work?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-08-02T15:00:11.843923Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T15:00:11.843923Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "51081708-922a-499f-8f90-be6ceec6e886", "text": " Backlinks are a powerful feature in Obsidian that automatically create bidirectional connections between notes. Here's how they work:\n\n1. Creation:\n   - When you link to a note from another note, Obsidian automatically creates a backlink.\n   - For example, if you link to \"Note B\" from \"Note A\", a backlink to \"Note A\" is created in \"Note B\".\n\n2. Visibility:\n   - Backlinks are displayed in a dedicated pane, usually at the bottom or side of the note.\n   - This pane shows all other notes that link to the current note.\n\n3. Context:\n   - Backlinks often show a snippet of the context in which the link appears.\n   - This helps you understand how the current note relates to others without opening them.\n\n4. Unlinked mentions:\n   - Obsidian also shows \"unlinked mentions\" - instances where the title of the current note appears in other notes without being explicitly linked.\n   - You can easily convert these to actual links if desired.\n\n5. Navigation:\n   - Clicking on a backlink takes you directly to the referencing note.\n   - This allows for quick navigation between related ideas.\n\n6. Knowledge discovery:\n   - Backlinks help you discover connections between ideas you might not have consciously made.\n   - They can reveal patterns and relationships in your knowledge base.\n\n7. Network view:\n   - Backlinks contribute to Obsidian's graph view, showing the interconnectedness of your notes visually.\n\n8. Automatic updates:\n   - If you change a note's title, Obsidian automatically updates all backlinks to reflect the new title.\n\n9. Contextual relevance:\n   - The number and nature of backlinks can indicate how central or important a note is in your knowledge system.\n\nBacklinks are a core feature of Obsidian's approach to networked thought, enabling a web-like structure of information rather than a rigid hierarchy. They support non-linear thinking and can help uncover unexpected connections between ideas.\n\nWould you like me to explain how to effectively use backlinks in your note-taking workflow?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-02T15:00:11.843923Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T15:00:11.843923Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "69cd3548-96e8-4ebe-b5bd-d615ee61c86d", "name": "Natural Fly Repellents", "created_at": "2024-08-02T14:46:34.376084Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T14:46:44.488636Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "142b178c-0875-46bf-98ef-61f81c961237", "text": "What are natural fly repellents?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-08-02T14:46:42.151771Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T14:46:42.151771Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "4fe16fbe-3449-4899-a424-428d9c9469e7", "text": " There are several natural fly repellents you can use:\n\n1.

Class syntax:\n   Make sure you're using the ES6 class syntax in your service files. JSDoc might not recognize classes if they're defined using older patterns.\n\n3. Export statement:\n   Verify that your classes are properly exported using the `export default` or `export` statements.\n\n4.

File extensions:\n   Check if JSDoc is configured to recognize the file extensions you're using (e.g., .js, .mjs, etc.).\n\nTo help diagnose the issue, I'd recommend:\n\n1. Double-checking your JSDoc configuration file.\n2. Verifying the class syntax and export statements in your service files.\n3. Running JSDoc with the `--debug` flag to get more detailed output about what files are being processed.\n\nQ1: Can you share your JSDoc configuration file contents?\nQ2: Are there any error messages or warnings when you run JSDoc?\nQ3: Have you tried running JSDoc on a single service file to see if it's recognized correctly?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-01T13:32:49.011690Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-01T13:32:49.011690Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "98f935c7-0dc3-40a6-b8bc-f56a9a59ee84", "text": "when I run jsdoc, why aren't the src/services/* files not listed under classes?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-08-01T13:32:49.011690Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-01T13:32:49.011690Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "e14eda59-f679-4875-9d31-f2bee072e00a", "text": "FileCopy.html does exist but it's not appearing in the index", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-08-01T13:36:45.393419Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-01T13:36:45.393419Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "43d4bd1c-a5e9-4e3d-a773-006e3faf3cb2", "text": " I see. If FileCopy.html exists but isn't appearing in the index, this suggests that JSDoc is processing the file but not including it in the generated documentation index for some reason. Let's explore some potential causes and solutions:\n\n1. Class documentation:\n   Ensure that the FileCopy class has a proper JSDoc comment block right above its declaration. It should include the `@class` tag.\n\n2. Module documentation:\n   Add a module documentation block at the top of the file. This can help JSDoc understand the file's structure better.\n\n3. Visibility:\n   Check if you're using any tags that might be affecting visibility, like `@private` or `@ignore`.\n\n4. JSDoc configuration:\n   Verify that your configuration isn't excluding certain files or using a template that might be filtering out some classes.\n\n5. Inheritance:\n   If FileCopy extends another class, make sure the parent class is also documented properly.\n\nHere's an example of how the top of your FileCopy.js file might look with proper JSDoc comments:\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * @module FileCopy\n */\n\n/**\n * FileCopy class for copying files and directories.\n * @class\n * @extends Service\n */\nclass FileCopy extends Service {\n    // ... rest of the class\n}\n```\n\nQ1: Does adding or modifying the JSDoc comments as shown above help with the indexing issue?\nQ2: Are other service files appearing in the index, or is this issue specific to FileCopy?\nQ3: What version of JSDoc are you using, and have you considered updating to the latest version if you're not already using it?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-01T13:36:45.393419Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-01T13:36:45.393419Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "ec8d3f37-6b79-4375-9ccc-bf18319eebbc", "text": "jsdoc isn't rendering the lines #### onward in this :\n/**\n * src/services/fs/FileCopy.js\n * \n * @class FileCopy\n * @extends Service\n */\n// src/services/fs/FileCopy.js\n/**\n * FileCopy Service\n * \n * Copies service that can copy individual files or entire directories on the local filesystem.\n * \n * #### __*Input*__\n * * message.applicationRootDir (optional) - The root directory of the application\n...", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-08-01T13:46:08.595323Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-01T13:46:08.595323Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "62b2ed2a-47cd-409b-a768-928378182ad1", "text": " I understand the issue now. JSDoc doesn't natively support the Markdown-style headers (####) or custom formatting like __*Input*__ in its documentation. These are being treated as plain text rather than formatted documentation. To address this, you have a few options:\n\n1. Use JSDoc tags:\n   Replace the custom formatting with JSDoc-specific tags. However, this won't give you the exact same formatting.\n\n2. Use a Markdown plugin:\n   There are plugins available that allow JSDoc to parse Markdown within comments. jsdoc-markdown is one such plugin.\n\n3. Use HTML:\n   JSDoc does support HTML in comments, which could be used to achieve similar formatting.\n\nHere's an example of how you might modify your comment to work better with standard JSDoc:\n\n```javascript\n/**\n * FileCopy Service\n * \n * Copies service that can copy individual files or entire directories on the local filesystem.\n * @class\n * @extends Service\n * \n * @description\n * <h4>Input</h4>\n * <ul>\n *   <li>message.applicationRootDir (optional) - The root directory of the application</li>\n *   <li>message.source (if no configKey) - The source path of the file or directory to copy</li>\n *   <li>message.destination (if no configKey) - The destination path for the copied file or directory</li>\n * </ul>\n * \n * <h4>Configuration</h4>\n * If a configKey is provided in the transmission:\n * <ul>\n *   <li>ns.trm.source - The source path relative to applicationRootDir</li>\n *   <li>ns.trm.destination - The destination path relative to applicationRootDir</li>\n * </ul>\n * \n * <h4>Output</h4>\n * <ul>\n *   <li>Copies the specified file or directory to the destination</li>\n *   <li>message (unmodified) - The input message is passed through</li>\n * </ul>\n * \n * <h4>Behavior</h4>\n * <ul>\n *   <li>Checks and creates target directories if they don't exist</li>\n *   <li>Copies individual files directly</li>\n *   <li>Recursively copies directories and their contents</li>\n *   <li>Logs detailed information about the copying process for debugging</li>\n * </ul>\n */\n```\n\nThis approach uses HTML tags to create headers and lists, which JSDoc will render correctly.\n\nQ1: Would you prefer to keep your current Markdown-style format and use a plugin, or are you open to modifying the comments to use HTML or standard JSDoc tags?\nQ2: Are you using any specific JSDoc template that might be affecting the rendering of these comments?\nQ3: Have you considered using a documentation generator that natively supports Markdown, such as TypeDoc (if you're using TypeScript) or documentation.js?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-01T13:46:08.595323Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-01T13:46:08.595323Z",

Check your Python path:\n\n   ```\n   which python\n   ```\n\n   Ensure it's pointing to the Termux Python installation.\n\n5. You can also try to locate where numpy is installed:\n\n   ```\n   pip show numpy\n   ```\n\n   This will show you the installation location.\n\n6.

The `ensureDirectoryExists` method checks if a directory exists and creates it if it doesn't.\n2. The `execute` method now calls `ensureDirectoryExists` before attempting to copy files or directories.\n3. The `copyDirectory` method has been updated to work recursively and use `ensureDirectoryExists`.\n4. Additional logging statements have been added throughout the code for better debugging.\n\nThese changes should address the issues with creating target directories and copying directories recursively. The added logging will help in identifying any remaining issues.\n\nQ1: Does this updated version resolve the issues with creating target directories?\nQ2: Are there any specific error messages or unexpected behaviors you're still seeing?\nQ3: Is there any part of the file copying process that still needs improvement or clarification?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-01T12:29:51.516757Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-01T12:29:51.516757Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "0b78eb78-036f-4f38-843f-1c2b4e9ed31a", "text": "Please generate a comment session for FileCopy.js like this example : \n/**\n * Represents a directory walker service that traverses a directory and emits messages for files with desired extensions.\n * @extends SourceService\n * \n * #### __*Input*__\n * * message.rootDir \n * * message.sourceDir\n * #### __*Output*__\n * * message.filename (multi)\n * \n */", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-08-01T12:37:15.101564Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-01T12:37:15.101564Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "945fb7a1-63a1-4603-8ad4-21e604ec1707", "text": " Certainly!

The error message suggests that the source file `/home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/data/start/one.txt` does not exist. Let's address this issue:\n\n1. First, let's check if the source directory and file exist:\n\n```javascript\nimport fs from 'fs/promises';\nimport path from 'path';\n\n// Add this function to your test file\nasync function checkFileExists(filePath) {\n  try {\n    await fs.access(filePath);\n    return true;\n  } catch {\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n\n// In your beforeAll function, add:\nconst sourceFile = path.join(testDir, 'start', 'one.txt');\nconst sourceExists = await checkFileExists(sourceFile);\nconsole.log(`Source file exists: ${sourceExists}`);\n```\n\n2. If the source file doesn't exist, we need to ensure it's created in the `setupInitialStructure` function:\n\n```javascript\nasync function setupInitialStructure() {\n  const startDir = path.join(testDir, 'start');\n  await fs.mkdir(startDir, { recursive: true });\n  await fs.writeFile(path.join(startDir, 'one.txt'), 'Hello from One');\n  await fs.writeFile(path.join(startDir, 'two.txt'), 'Hello from Two');\n}\n```\n\n3. In the FileCopy service, add more detailed error logging:\n\n```javascript\nclass FileCopy extends Service {\n  async execute(message) {\n    // ... existing code ...\n    try {\n      if (sourceStat.isFile()) {\n        console.log(`Copying file from ${source} to ${destination}`);\n        await copyFile(source, destination);\n      } else if (sourceStat.isDirectory()) {\n        console.log(`Copying directory from ${source} to ${destination}`);\n        await this.copyDirectory(source, destination);\n      }\n    } catch (err) {\n      console.error(`Error in FileCopy: ${err.message}`);\n      console.error(`Source: ${source}`);\n      console.error(`Destination: ${destination}`);\n    }\n    // ... rest of the code ...\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Make sure the paths in your `services.ttl` file are correct and relative to the application root:\n\n```turtle\nt:copyOneToSingleEmpty a trm:ServiceConfig ;\n    trm:key t:copyOneToSingleEmpty ;\n    trm:source \"src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/data/start/one.txt\" ;\n    trm:destination \"src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/data/single-empty/one.txt\" .\n```\n\nAfter making these changes, run the test again. The additional logging should help identify where exactly the problem is occurring.\n\nQ1: Are the file paths in the `services.ttl` file correct and relative to the project root?\nQ2: Is the `setupInitialStructure` function being called before the test runs?\nQ3: Are there any permission issues that might prevent file operations in the test directories?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-31T12:44:38.283621Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-31T12:44:38.283621Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "de1ef43e-a7b6-432c-87c0-4b003968b979", "text": "danny@danny-desktop:~/HKMS/transmissions$ npm test -- tests/integration/file-copy-remove-test.spec.js\n> transmissions@1.0.0 test\n> jasmine --config=jasmine.json --reporter=tests/helpers/reporter.js tests/integration/file-copy-remove-test.spec.js\nJasmine started\nStarting beforeAll...\nSource file exists: true\nFinished beforeAll\nStarting test...\nExec completed\nstdout: [api.logger] log level: info\n[api.logger] disabling console.debug()\n+ ***** Load Config ******\n[Transmission : src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/transmission.ttl]\n[Services Config : src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/services.ttl]\n+ ***** Construct *****\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s1> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/FileCopy>\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s2> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/FileCopy>\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s3> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/FileRemove>\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s4> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/FileCopy>\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s5> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/FileCopy>\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s6> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/FileRemove>\n  > Connect #0 [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s1] => [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s2]\n  > Connect #1 [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s2] => [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s3]\n  > Connect #2 [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s3] => [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s4]\n  > Connect #3 [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s4] => [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s5]\n  > Connect #4 [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s5] => [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s6]\n+ ***** Execute *****\n| Running : http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s1 a FileCopy\nsource = /home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/data/start/one.txt\ndestination = /home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/data/single-empty/one.txt\n[Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/data/start/one.txt'] {\n  errno: -2,\n  code: 'ENOENT',\n  syscall: 'stat',\n  path: '/home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/data/start/one.txt'\n}\n0\nsingle-empty contents: []\nsingle-full contents: []\nError in assertions: AssertionError: expected [] to deeply equal [ 'one.txt' ]\n    at file:///home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/tests/integration/file-copy-remove-test.spec.js:84:44 {\n  actual: [],\n  expected: [ 'one.txt' ],\n  showDiff: true,\n  operator: 'deepStrictEqual'\n}\ndanny@danny-desktop:~/HKMS/transmissions$", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-31T12:49:44.791151Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-31T12:49:44.791151Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "0f8e66c5-68f8-4fe5-b9d8-ba9fadc1e737", "text": " The error message indicates that the file paths in the `services.ttl` file are incorrect.

In your test file, add more logging to see the actual file paths:\n\n```javascript\nit('performs file operations correctly', function (done) {\n  console.log('Starting test...');\n  console.log('Test directory:', testDir);\n  exec('node run.js file-copy-remove-test', { cwd: process.cwd() }, async (error, stdout, stderr) => {\n    console.log('Exec completed');\n    console.log('Current working directory:', process.cwd());\n    if (error) {\n      console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);\n      return done(error);\n    }\n    if (stderr) {\n      console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);\n    }\n    console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);\n    // ... rest of the test ...\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThese changes should help identify and resolve the path issues. The key is to ensure that all file operations are using the correct base path relative to the application root.\n\nQ1: After making these changes, does the file copy operation succeed?\nQ2: Are there any discrepancies between the paths used in the test setup and the paths used in the actual file operations?\nQ3: Is the `applicationRootDir` being set and used correctly throughout the execution process?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-31T12:49:44.791151Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-31T12:49:44.791151Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "65924dcd-4a80-4696-b782-4f894b705c96", "name": "Representing RDF in XML with W3C Spec", "created_at": "2024-07-31T13:10:05.346606Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-31T13:16:10.821750Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "c993b5e5-de48-4583-bc39-7f62145a31ee", "text": "there is a w3c spec that defines how a URL can be inserted into an xmldoc and allows the  xml to be converted into rdf automatically, typically via xslt", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-31T13:10:15.039570Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-31T13:10:15.039570Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "5c85bc83-a233-4440-869f-edea695a32cc", "text": " You're referring to the RDF/XML syntax specification, which is indeed a W3C recommendation. This specification defines how to represent RDF (Resource Description Framework) data using XML syntax. Here's a brief overview:\n\n1. RDF/XML Syntax: This W3C specification allows URLs to be embedded in XML documents in a way that enables automatic conversion to RDF.\n\n2. Key Features:\n   - Uses XML namespaces to differentiate RDF-specific elements\n   - Provides a standardized way to represent RDF triples (subject, predicate, object) in XML\n   - Allows for the inclusion of URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) to identify resources\n\n3. Conversion Process:\n   - While XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) can be used for conversion, it's not the only method.\n   - Many RDF libraries and tools can directly parse RDF/XML without needing an intermediate XSLT step.\n\n4. Example Structure:\n   ```xml\n   <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"\n            xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">\n     <rdf:Description rdf:about=\"http://www.example.org/book\">\n       <dc:title>Example Book</dc:title>\n       <dc:creator>John Doe</dc:creator>\n     </rdf:Description>\n   </rdf:RDF>\n   ```\n\nThis specification is crucial for interoperability between XML-based systems and RDF-based semantic web applications. It allows for seamless integration of structured data on the web.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this specification or its usage?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-31T13:10:15.039570Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-31T13:10:15.039570Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "f6120f7a-7ee7-4c02-b705-b1df137dce19", "text": "summarise grddl", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-31T13:11:15.201107Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-31T13:11:15.201107Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "8e2c542d-a84f-4a13-afc5-33bf13f5bb93", "text": " GRDDL (Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages) is a W3C recommendation that provides a mechanism for extracting RDF data from XML documents and XHTML pages. Here's a summary of GRDDL:\n\n1. Purpose:\n   - Enables the automatic extraction of RDF triples from XML and XHTML documents.\n   - Bridges the gap between XML-based formats and RDF-based Semantic Web applications.\n\n2. Key Features:\n   - Uses existing standards: XML, XHTML, RDF, and XSLT.\n   - Allows documents to specify their own transformation mechanisms.\n   - Can be applied to entire XML dialects or individual documents.\n\n3. Mechanism:\n   - GRDDL-aware agents look for references to transformations in XML documents.\n   - These transformations (typically XSLT) convert the document into RDF.\n\n4. Implementation:\n   - For XHTML: Uses profile and link elements to point to GRDDL transformations.\n   - For XML: Uses namespace documents or attributes to indicate GRDDL transformations.\n\n5. Benefits:\n   - Enables semantic enrichment of existing XML and XHTML content.\n   - Facilitates the integration of diverse data sources into the Semantic Web.\n\n6. Limitations:\n   - Requires additional processing compared to native RDF formats.\n   - Transformation quality depends on the XSLT (or other transformation) provided.\n\nGRDDL is particularly useful for organizations with large amounts of existing XML data who want to make this data available in RDF format without completely overhauling their current systems.\n\nWould you like more information on any specific aspect of GRDDL?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-31T13:11:15.201107Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-31T13:11:15.201107Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "e4535fa9-651d-49d9-80d2-2629240d1567", "text": "what is the most widely supported means of including non-visible comments in markdown", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-31T13:13:25.740945Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-31T13:13:25.740945Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "6fba6784-8f36-4917-bb81-8578dbcd6e4b", "text": " The most widely supported method for including non-visible comments in Markdown is using HTML comment syntax.

There might be an issue with the Jasmine reporter.\n\nLet's modify the test to add more logging and ensure the `done()` callback is always called:\n\n```javascript\nimport { expect } from 'chai';\nimport { exec } from 'child_process';\nimport { readdir, rm } from 'fs/promises';\nimport path from 'path';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'url';\n\nconst __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);\nconst __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);\nconst testDir = path.resolve(__dirname, '../../src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/data');\n\ndescribe('file-copy-remove-test', function () {\n  // Increase the timeout for the entire test suite\n  jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL = 30000; // 30 seconds\n\n  async function getDirContents(dir) {\n    try {\n      return await readdir(path.join(testDir, dir));\n    } catch (error) {\n      if (error.code === 'ENOENT') return [];\n      throw error;\n    }\n  }\n\n  async function clearDir(dir) {\n    try {\n      await rm(path.join(testDir, dir), { recursive: true, force: true });\n    } catch (error) {\n      if (error.code !== 'ENOENT') throw error;\n    }\n  }\n\n  beforeAll(async function () {\n    console.log('Starting beforeAll...');\n    await Promise.all([\n      clearDir('single-empty'),\n      clearDir('single-full'),\n      clearDir('several-empty'),\n      clearDir('several-full')\n    ]);\n    console.log('Finished beforeAll');\n  });\n\n  it('performs file operations correctly', function (done) {\n    console.log('Starting test...');\n    exec('node run.js file-copy-remove-test', async (error, stdout, stderr) => {\n      console.log('Exec completed');\n      if (error) {\n        console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);\n        return done(error);\n      }\n      if (stderr) {\n        console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);\n      }\n      console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);\n      try {\n        const singleEmpty = await getDirContents('single-empty');\n        console.log('single-empty contents:', singleEmpty);\n        expect(singleEmpty).to.be.empty;\n\n        const singleFull = await getDirContents('single-full');\n        console.log('single-full contents:', singleFull);\n        expect(singleFull).to.deep.equal(['one.txt']);\n\n        const severalEmpty = await getDirContents('several-empty');\n        console.log('several-empty contents:', severalEmpty);\n        expect(severalEmpty).to.be.empty;\n\n        const severalFull = await getDirContents('several-full');\n        console.log('several-full contents:', severalFull);\n        expect(severalFull).to.have.members(['one.txt', 'two.txt']);\n\n        console.log('All assertions passed');\n        done();\n      } catch (err) {\n        console.error('Error in assertions:', err);\n        done(err);\n      }\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThese changes add more logging throughout the test, which will help us understand where the test might be failing or hanging. Additionally, we've increased the timeout for the entire test suite to 30 seconds to ensure it has enough time to complete.\n\nTry running the test again with these modifications. The additional logging should give us more insight into what's happening during the test execution.\n\nQ1: Does the console output now show any of the added log messages?\nQ2: Is the `run.js` script completing its execution, or could it be hanging?\nQ3: Are there any errors or warnings in the Node.js process output that might not be captured by Jasmine?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-31T12:23:39.449614Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-31T12:23:39.449614Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "894e8ce7-8091-4610-a552-83c1cfacdd2b", "text": "now it's silent : \nnpm test -- tests/integration/file-copy-remove-test.spec.js\n> transmissions@1.0.0 test\n> jasmine --config=jasmine.json --reporter=tests/helpers/reporter.js tests/integration/file-copy-remove-test.spec.js\nJasmine started", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-31T12:23:39.449614Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-31T12:23:39.449614Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "8c68527e-942a-49c4-95d3-e1b4a2d3c128", "text": " Thank you for providing the detailed output.

The error message indicates that the source file `/home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/data/start/one.txt` does not exist.\n\n2. The test expects `single-full` to contain `one.txt`, but it's empty.\n\nLet's modify the `services.ttl` and `transmission.ttl` files to correct these issues:\n\n1. Update `src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/services.ttl`:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix trm: <http://purl.org/stuff/transmission/> .\n@prefix t: <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/> .\n\nt:copyOneToSingleEmpty a trm:ServiceConfig ;\n    trm:key t:copyOneToSingleEmpty ;\n    trm:source \"data/start/one.txt\" ;\n    trm:destination \"data/single-empty/one.txt\" .\n\nt:copySingleEmptyToSingleFull a trm:ServiceConfig ;\n    trm:key t:copySingleEmptyToSingleFull ;\n    trm:source \"data/single-empty/one.txt\" ;\n    trm:destination \"data/single-full/one.txt\" .\n\nt:removeSingleEmpty a trm:ServiceConfig ;\n    trm:key t:removeSingleEmpty ;\n    trm:target \"data/single-empty/one.txt\" .\n\nt:copyStartToSeveralEmpty a trm:ServiceConfig ;\n    trm:key t:copyStartToSeveralEmpty ;\n    trm:source \"data/start\" ;\n    trm:destination \"data/several-empty\" .\n\nt:copySeveralEmptyToSeveralFull a trm:ServiceConfig ;\n    trm:key t:copySeveralEmptyToSeveralFull ;\n    trm:source \"data/several-empty\" ;\n    trm:destination \"data/several-full\" .\n\nt:removeSeveralEmpty a trm:ServiceConfig ;\n    trm:key t:removeSeveralEmpty ;\n    trm:target \"data/several-empty\" .\n```\n\n2.

Ensure that the `data/start` directory exists and contains the necessary files (`one.txt` and `two.txt`).\n\n4. Modify the test file to create the initial directory structure:\n\n```javascript\n// Add this function at the beginning of your test file\nasync function setupInitialStructure() {\n  const startDir = path.join(testDir, 'start');\n  await fs.mkdir(startDir, { recursive: true });\n  await fs.writeFile(path.join(startDir, 'one.txt'), 'Hello from One');\n  await fs.writeFile(path.join(startDir, 'two.txt'), 'Hello from Two');\n}\n\n// Modify the beforeAll function\nbeforeAll(async function () {\n  console.log('Starting beforeAll...');\n  await setupInitialStructure();\n  await Promise.all([\n    clearDir('single-empty'),\n    clearDir('single-full'),\n    clearDir('several-empty'),\n    clearDir('several-full')\n  ]);\n  console.log('Finished beforeAll');\n});\n```\n\nThese changes should align the test setup with the expected behavior described in the `about.md` file.

The error states that the executable \"node\" cannot be linked because it's missing the library \"libicui18n.so.73\".\n\n2.

In turtle-editor.js, make sure to call the init function:\n\n// client/js/turtle-editor.js\n\ndefine(['jquery', /* other dependencies */, 'webFsClient'],\nfunction ($, /* other dependencies */, webFsClient) {\n    \n    // ... existing code ...\n\n    var editor = CodeMirror.fromTextArea(inputElements.contents[0], {\n        // ... editor options ...\n    });\n\n    // Initialize webFsClient with the editor instance\n    webFsClient.init(editor);\n\n    // ... rest of the code ...\n});\n\n3. Update index.html to remove the onclick attributes:\n\n<!-- client/index.html -->\n\n<button id=\"load-button\">Edit</button>\n<button id=\"save-button\">Save</button>\n\n4. Add event listeners in turtle-editor.js:\n\n// client/js/turtle-editor.js\n\ndefine(['jquery', /* other dependencies */, 'webFsClient'],\nfunction ($, /* other dependencies */, webFsClient) {\n    \n    // ... existing code ...\n\n    $('#load-button').on('click', window.loadContent);\n    $('#save-button').on('click', window.saveContent);\n\n    // ... rest of the code ...\n});\n\nThese changes should resolve the \"loadContent is not defined\" error by ensuring that the functions are available globally and properly initialized.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. The HTML structure defines a game container with a word container for the letter boxes, a message area, and two buttons (Submit and Play Again).\n\n2. The CSS styles the game elements, including the letter boxes, buttons, and overall layout.\n\n3. The JavaScript code implements the game logic:\n   - It defines a dictionary of words starting with X.\n   - The `initGame()` function sets up a new game by choosing a random word and creating the appropriate number of letter boxes.\n   - The `checkGuess()` function compares the player's guess with the target word and displays the result.\n   - Event listeners are added to the Submit and Play Again buttons.\n\n4. The game starts automatically when the page loads.\n\nTo use this game, simply save the code as an HTML file (e.g., `x-word-game.html`) and open it in a web browser. The game will load, and you can start playing immediately.\n\nNote that the dictionary in this example is limited to a few words for demonstration purposes. In a real implementation, you would want to expand this list to include more words beginning with X.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-27T22:04:03.359130Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T22:04:03.359130Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "2dd726a5-c503-4cdc-bcd1-f5071cf9ed1b", "text": " Certainly!

Added an `onLetterInput` function to handle the input event on each letter box:\n\n```javascript\nfunction onLetterInput(event) {\n    if (event.target.value.length === 1) {\n        const nextSibling = event.target.nextElementSibling;\n        if (nextSibling && nextSibling.classList.contains(\"letter-box\")) {\n            nextSibling.focus();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Modified the `initGame` function to add the input event listener to each letter box:\n\n```javascript\nletterBox.addEventListener(\"input\", onLetterInput);\n```\n\n3. Added a line at the end of the `initGame` function to focus on the second input box when the game starts:\n\n```javascript\nwordContainer.children[1].focus();\n```\n\nThese changes will make the game more user-friendly by automatically moving the focus to the next input box when a letter is entered. The player can now type their guess more efficiently without having to manually click or tab to the next box.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-27T22:14:34.141729Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T22:14:34.141729Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "4ad02e43-60dc-47b4-821e-1c2df862b76a", "text": "please modify so that when a letter is entered, the next box gets focus", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-27T22:14:34.141729Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T22:14:34.141729Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "968a91db-a3ad-4f8f-9f42-b24cd690bffa", "name": "Git clone error: RPC failed, unexpected disconnect", "created_at": "2024-07-27T13:44:49.523389Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T18:13:17.231137Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "221acacb-fc2b-4743-aab2-3352e7e0b5af", "text": "git clone https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-static.git\nCloning into 'hyperdata-static'...\nremote: Enumerating objects: 8021, done.\nerror: RPC failed; curl 92 HTTP/2 stream 5 was not closed cleanly: CANCEL (err 8)\nerror: 18368 bytes of body are still expected\nfetch-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet\nfatal: early EOF\nfatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-27T13:44:57.657258Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T13:44:57.657258Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "0c4d3e57-ea29-42be-8072-1e449701e7db", "text": " It appears you're encountering an error while trying to clone the 'hyperdata-static' repository from GitHub. The error message suggests there was a problem with the network connection during the cloning process. Here's a breakdown of what's happening and some potential solutions:\n\n1. The cloning process started successfully and began enumerating objects.\n2. An RPC (Remote Procedure Call) failure occurred, specifically a curl error 92.\n3. The connection was unexpectedly terminated before all the data was received.\n\nThis error can occur due to various reasons, including:\n- Unstable network connection\n- Firewall or antivirus interference\n- GitHub server issues\n- Large repository size\n\nHere are some steps you can try to resolve this issue:\n\n1. Retry the clone operation:\n   Sometimes, simply trying again can work if it was a temporary network issue.\n\n2. Use a shallow clone:\n   ```\n   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-static.git\n   ```\n   This will only fetch the most recent commit, which can help if the repository is large.\n\n3. Increase the buffer size:\n   ```\n   git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000\n   ```\n   Then try cloning again.\n\n4. Use Git LFS if the repository uses large files:\n   ```\n   git lfs clone https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-static.git\n   ```\n\n5. Check your network connection and try on a different network if possible.\n\n6. Temporarily disable your firewall or antivirus to see if they're interfering.\n\n7. If the problem persists, you can try downloading the repository as a ZIP file from the GitHub website as an alternative.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, the issue might be on GitHub's end, in which case you may want to wait a while and try again later, or contact GitHub support if the problem continues.\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these solutions in more detail?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-27T13:44:57.657258Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T13:44:57.657258Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "14036edd-3bb9-49c4-901f-6ca421bea644", "text": "git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-static.git\nCloning into 'hyperdata-static'...\nremote: Enumerating objects: 6659, done.\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (6659/6659), done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (4808/4808), done.\nerror: RPC failed; curl 92 HTTP/2 stream 5 was not closed cleanly: CANCEL (err 8)\nerror: 1796 bytes of body are still expected\nfetch-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet\nfatal: early EOF\nfatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-27T13:57:17.443551Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T13:57:17.443551Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "d5a13b55-28b2-4092-aced-01f9ab0619a9", "text": " I see you've tried the shallow clone method with `--depth 1`, but unfortunately, you're still encountering a similar error. This persistent issue suggests that the problem might be related to your network connection or some interference between your system and GitHub's servers. Let's try a few more approaches:\n\n1. Increase Git buffer size and timeout:\n   Run these commands and then try cloning again:\n   ```\n   git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000\n   git config --global http.lowSpeedLimit 0\n   git config --global http.lowSpeedTime 999999\n   ```\n\n2. Use Git protocol instead of HTTPS:\n   ```\n   git clone git://github.com/danja/hyperdata-static.git\n   ```\n\n3. Clone with specific Git version:\n   If you have an older version of Git installed alongside your current one, try:\n   ```\n   GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 /path/to/older/git clone https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-static.git\n   ```\n   Replace `/path/to/older/git` with the actual path to an older Git version if available.\n\n4. Try cloning with verbose output to get more information:\n   ```\n   GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 git clone https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-static.git\n   ```\n\n5. Check your proxy settings:\n   If you're behind a proxy, ensure your Git proxy settings are correct:\n   ```\n   git config --global http.proxy http://proxyuser:proxypwd@proxy.server.com:8080\n   ```\n   Replace with your actual proxy details.\n\n6. Temporarily disable IPv6:\n   Sometimes IPv6 can cause issues. Try disabling it temporarily:\n   ```\n   git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000\n   git -c http.version=1.1 clone https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-static.git\n   ```\n\n7. If possible, try cloning on a different network or from a different machine to isolate whether the issue is specific to your current setup.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, you might want to:\n- Contact your network administrator if you're on a corporate or institutional network.\n- Report the issue to GitHub support, as it could be a problem on their end.\n- As a last resort, you could download the ZIP file of the repository from the GitHub website and then initialize it as a Git repository locally.\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these methods in more detail?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-27T13:57:17.443551Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T13:57:17.443551Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "c5e595a4-2715-40d9-9a62-66904e0aadfc", "text": " To install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) using apt on a Debian-based Linux distribution like Ubuntu, you can follow these steps:\n\n1.

Make sure 'rdf-ext' is listed in your package.json:\n   Open your package.json file and check if 'rdf-ext' is listed under \"dependencies\" or \"devDependencies\".\n\n2. If it's not in package.json, install it:\n   ```\n   npm install rdf-ext\n   ```\n\n3. If it is in package.json, try reinstalling all dependencies:\n   ```\n   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json\n   npm install\n   ```\n\n4. Check if you're using ES modules:\n   If your package.json has `\"type\": \"module\"`, or if you're using `import` instead of `require`, make sure your import statement is correct:\n   ```javascript\n   import rdfExt from 'rdf-ext';\n   ```\n   Or if you're importing specific parts:\n   ```javascript\n   import { someFunction } from 'rdf-ext';\n   ```\n\n5. Verify Node.js version:\n   Some packages require a specific Node.js version. Check if your Node.js version meets the requirements of 'rdf-ext'.\n\n6.

However, if you're not seeing any files being copied, there could be a few reasons for this:\n\n1. Error Handling: The `execute` method doesn't have any error handling. If an error occurs, it might be silently failing. Try wrapping the content of `execute` in a try-catch block:\n\n   ```javascript\n   async execute(message) {\n     try {\n       // ... existing code ...\n     } catch (error) {\n       logger.error('Error in FileCopy execute:', error);\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Permissions: Ensure that the process has the necessary permissions to read from the source and write to the destination.\n\n3. Paths: Double-check that the `source` and `destination` paths are correct. You're logging these, so verify in the logs that they point to the expected locations.\n\n4. Asynchronous Operation: The `copyFile` and `copyDirectory` operations are asynchronous, but you're not waiting for them to complete before emitting the message. Try adding `await`:\n\n   ```javascript\n   if (sourceStat.isFile()) {\n     logger.log('copying file');\n     await copyFile(source, destination);\n   } else if (sourceStat.isDirectory()) {\n     logger.log('copying dir');\n     await this.copyDirectory(source, destination);\n   }\n\n   // Only emit after copy operations are complete\n   this.emit('message', message);\n   ```\n\n5. Overwriting: If the destination file already exists, `copyFile` will overwrite it. If you're not seeing changes, it might be because the files are identical.\n\n6. Relative Paths: Make sure that relative paths are resolved correctly. Your code uses `path.join` with `message.applicationRootDir`, which should handle this, but verify that `message.applicationRootDir` is set correctly.\n\n7. Debugging: Add more detailed logging throughout the process. For example:\n\n   ```javascript\n   logger.log(`About to copy from ${source} to ${destination}`);\n   await copyFile(source, destination);\n   logger.log(`Finished copying from ${source} to ${destination}`);\n   ```\n\n8. File System Events: If you're checking for the copied files immediately after the operation, remember that file system operations can sometimes take a moment to be visible. Try adding a small delay or using a file system watcher to confirm when the operation is complete.\n\nIf after checking these points you're still not seeing files being copied, you might want to add more granular logging or use a debugger to step through the code and see exactly where it might be failing or not behaving as expected.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-27T18:13:17.231137Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T18:13:17.231137Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "ce6a7e14-fbd2-4b26-a86c-8e9cac865e16", "name": "The Co-evolution of Language and the Brain", "created_at": "2024-07-26T08:52:48.460643Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-26T08:52:58.002853Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "9bd0abe6-dd99-475c-b280-d9f064c5c7f6", "text": "Could you summarise the hypotheses in the book Symbolic Species: The Co-evolution of Language and the Brain, W.

Here's an overview of the main hypotheses:\n\n1. Co-evolution of language and the brain: Deacon proposes that human language and the human brain evolved together in a process of co-evolution. This means that as language developed, it influenced brain evolution, and as the brain evolved, it shaped language development.\n\n2. Symbolic thought as the key distinction: The central argument is that humans are unique in their ability to think symbolically. This symbolic thought is the foundation of language and separates human cognition from that of other species.\n\n3. Language as a \"complex adaptive system\": Deacon suggests that language is not simply a product of a language-specific module in the brain, but rather emerges from the interaction of various cognitive and neural systems.\n\n4. The importance of symbols in human cognition: Deacon argues that the ability to use symbols fundamentally changed human cognition, allowing for abstract thinking, planning, and complex social interactions.\n\n5. Prefrontal cortex development: The book proposes that the expansion of the prefrontal cortex in humans played a crucial role in the development of symbolic thought and language.\n\n6. Cultural transmission of language: Deacon emphasizes the role of cultural transmission in language evolution, suggesting that languages adapt to be learnable by children.\n\n7. Critique of innate language theories: The book challenges theories of innate language modules, proposing instead that language emerges from more general cognitive abilities.\n\nThese hypotheses form the core of Deacon's argument about the unique nature of human language and cognition.

Let me break this down in simpler terms:\n\n1. Brain regions involved:\n   - Frontal lobe: The front part of the brain, responsible for things like planning, decision-making, and impulse control.\n   - Striatum: A group of structures deep in the brain that play a role in motivation, reward, and habit formation.\n\n2. The connection:\n   These models suggest that the communication between the frontal lobe and the striatum is altered in people with ADHD.\n\n3. How it relates to ADHD symptoms:\n   - Attention issues: The frontal lobe helps us focus and pay attention. If it's not communicating effectively with the striatum, it may be harder to maintain attention.\n   - Hyperactivity: The striatum is involved in controlling movement. Altered communication might make it harder to sit still.\n   - Impulsivity: The frontal lobe normally helps us think before we act. If this system is disrupted, it could lead to more impulsive behavior.\n\n4. Neurotransmitters:\n   These models often highlight the role of chemicals in the brain, particularly dopamine. Dopamine is important for motivation and reward, and its levels or functioning may be different in people with ADHD.\n\n5. Executive functions:\n   The fronto-striatal system is crucial for executive functions - skills like organizing, planning, and regulating emotions. Differences in this system could explain why these skills are often challenging for people with ADHD.\n\nIn essence, fronto-striatal models suggest that ADHD symptoms arise from differences in how certain parts of the brain communicate and function, particularly the frontal lobe and striatum.

Here's a more detailed look:\n\n1. Location and structure:\n   - The striatum is located deep within the brain, forming part of the basal ganglia.\n   - It's divided into two main parts: the dorsal striatum (caudate nucleus and putamen) and the ventral striatum (including the nucleus accumbens).\n\n2. Key functions:\n   - Reward processing: The striatum is central to our brain's reward system. It helps us feel pleasure from positive experiences and motivates us to repeat rewarding behaviors.\n   - Motor control: It's involved in initiating and controlling voluntary movements.\n   - Habit formation: The striatum plays a key role in learning and performing habitual behaviors.\n   - Decision-making: It helps evaluate options and make choices, especially those involving rewards or punishments.\n\n3. Neurotransmitters:\n   - Dopamine is a major player in the striatum. It's crucial for reward signaling and movement control.\n   - Other important neurotransmitters include glutamate and GABA.\n\n4. Role in ADHD:\n   - In ADHD, the striatum may show differences in structure, function, or connectivity.\n   - These differences might affect how rewards are processed, potentially explaining why people with ADHD often seek immediate rather than delayed rewards.\n   - It may also relate to difficulties in motor control (hyperactivity) and habit formation (challenges with routine).\n\n5. Connections:\n   - The striatum has extensive connections with other brain regions, particularly the frontal cortex.\n   - These connections form circuits that are crucial for cognitive control, motivation, and learning.\n\n6. Relevance to other conditions:\n   - The striatum is implicated in various neurological and psychiatric conditions beyond ADHD, including Parkinson's disease, addiction, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.\n\n7. Plasticity:\n   - The striatum shows a high degree of plasticity, meaning it can change and adapt based on experience. This is particularly important in learning and habit formation.\n\nUnderstanding the striatum helps explain many aspects of human behavior, from our ability to learn new skills to our struggles with impulsivity or addiction. In the context of ADHD, it provides insights into why certain behaviors or cognitive processes might be challenging for individuals with the condition.\n\nWould you like me to expand on any particular aspect of the striatum's role or function?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-26T08:35:58.429622Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-26T08:35:58.429622Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "49ee1a61-5e43-4265-8501-079f6cb8fc65", "text": "Compare differences related to the striatum that may result in the differences between ADHD and ocd", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-26T08:38:07.559600Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-26T08:38:07.559600Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "283b5e59-4047-45a3-b074-9240f070a63e", "text": " Comparing the striatal differences between ADHD and OCD is an interesting topic, as both disorders involve the striatum but in distinct ways. Here's a comparison:\n\n1. Striatal circuits involved:\n   - ADHD: Primarily involves the fronto-striatal circuit, especially connections between the prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum.\n   - OCD: Mainly involves the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, with emphasis on the ventral striatum and its connections to the orbitofrontal cortex.\n\n2. Neurotransmitter imbalances:\n   - ADHD: Often associated with dopamine deficiency in the striatum.\n   - OCD: More related to serotonin imbalance, though dopamine is also involved.\n\n3. Activation patterns:\n   - ADHD: Generally shows underactivation of the striatum during tasks requiring attention and inhibition.\n   - OCD: Typically shows hyperactivation of the striatum, particularly during symptom provocation or error processing.\n\n4. Reward processing:\n   - ADHD: Often exhibits reduced striatal activation in response to rewards, potentially explaining difficulties with motivation and delayed gratification.\n   - OCD: May show excessive striatal activation in response to both rewards and punishments, possibly contributing to compulsive behaviors.\n\n5. Cognitive flexibility:\n   - ADHD: Striatal underactivation may contribute to difficulties in shifting attention and adapting to new situations.\n   - OCD: Overactivation in striatal circuits may lead to rigid thinking and difficulty disengaging from repetitive thoughts or behaviors.\n\n6. Impulsivity vs. Compulsivity:\n   - ADHD: Striatal dysfunction is associated with impulsivity and difficulty inhibiting responses.\n   - OCD: Striatal overactivity is linked to compulsivity and excessive inhibition.\n\n7. Learning and habit formation:\n   - ADHD: May have difficulties forming adaptive habits due to altered striatal function.\n   - OCD: Tends to form maladaptive habits more easily, possibly due to overactive striatal circuits.\n\n8. Response to medication:\n   - ADHD: Often responds well to stimulants that increase dopamine in the striatum.\n   - OCD: Typically treated with SSRIs that modulate serotonin, affecting striatal function indirectly.\n\n9. Structural differences:\n   - ADHD: Some studies show reduced striatal volume, particularly in the caudate.\n   - OCD: Often exhibits increased striatal volume, especially in the putamen.\n\n10. Developmental trajectories:\n    - ADHD: Striatal abnormalities may persist but can change over development, often improving in adulthood.\n    - OCD: Striatal dysfunction tends to be more stable over time, though it can be influenced by treatment.\n\nThese differences highlight how the same brain structure can be involved in different disorders through distinct mechanisms. In ADHD, the striatum's underactivation contributes to difficulties with attention, motivation, and impulse control. In OCD, striatal overactivation is associated with rigid, repetitive behaviors and thoughts.\n\nIt's important to note that while these patterns are generally observed, there's considerable variability among individuals, and some people may even have both ADHD and OCD, complicating the neurobiological picture.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-26T08:38:07.559600Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-26T08:38:07.559600Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "2201438a-eeb1-4b58-8d1a-9f693a0b9418", "text": "How strong is the observational evidence of striatum role in ADHD, how much hypothesis?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-26T08:41:44.552068Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-26T08:41:44.552068Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "8e46d74b-89c8-4d71-996e-4bc8e808969d", "text": " The role of the striatum in ADHD has been a subject of considerable research, but like many areas in neuroscience, the picture is complex. Let's break down the current state of evidence:\n\nObservational Evidence:\n\n1. Neuroimaging studies:\n   - Structural MRI: Several studies have found reduced volume in striatal regions, particularly the caudate, in individuals with ADHD. This evidence is fairly consistent, but not universal.\n   - Functional MRI: Multiple studies have shown altered activation patterns in the striatum during tasks involving attention, reward processing, and inhibition. This evidence is moderately strong but with some variability in findings.\n\n2. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies:\n   - Have shown reduced dopamine release and receptor binding in the striatum in ADHD. This evidence is quite consistent but based on a smaller number of studies due to the technique's invasiveness.\n\n3. Genetics:\n   - Several genes involved in dopamine signaling in the striatum (e.g., DAT1, DRD4) have been associated with ADHD risk. This evidence is moderate but complicated by the polygenic nature of ADHD.\n\n4. Pharmacological evidence:\n   - The effectiveness of stimulant medications, which primarily act on dopamine systems in the striatum, provides indirect support for striatal involvement. This evidence is strong but indirect.\n\n5. Animal models:\n   - Studies in animals with manipulated striatal function show ADHD-like behaviors. This evidence is strong in animal models but requires careful translation to humans.\n\nHypotheses and Limitations:\n\n1. Causality: While striatal differences are observed in ADHD, it's not always clear if these are causes, consequences, or merely correlates of the disorder.\n\n2. Specificity: Striatal involvement is not unique to ADHD and is seen in other disorders, raising questions about its specific role in ADHD.\n\n3. Developmental changes: The role of the striatum may change over the lifespan, complicating our understanding of its role in ADHD.\n\n4. Heterogeneity: ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder, and not all individuals with ADHD may show the same striatal differences.\n\n5. Integration with other brain regions: The striatum doesn't function in isolation, and its role in ADHD likely depends on its interactions with other brain regions, particularly the prefrontal cortex.\n\n6. Methodology: Different studies use varied methods and tasks, making direct comparisons challenging.\n\nIn summary, there is substantial observational evidence supporting the involvement of the striatum in ADHD, particularly from neuroimaging, genetic, and pharmacological studies. However, much of our understanding still relies on hypotheses about how these observed differences translate into ADHD symptoms.\n\nThe strength of evidence could be characterized as moderate to strong for striatal involvement in ADHD, but with significant room for further research to clarify the precise nature and extent of this involvement.

You're right to be cautious about some of the descriptions that have circulated, as there has indeed been some mythologizing and exaggeration around Mozart's compositional methods.\n\nThe most famous (and largely discredited) account comes from an 1815 letter supposedly written by Mozart, describing how entire compositions would form in his mind instantly and perfectly. This letter was actually a fabrication by Friedrich Rochlitz, a music critic and publisher.\n\nHowever, there are some more reliable sources that give us insight into Mozart's working methods:\n\n1. Mozart's own letters: In his authentic correspondence, Mozart occasionally mentions his compositional process, though not in great detail.\n\n2. Sketches and drafts: While Mozart was known for his remarkable ability to compose quickly and with few corrections, musicologists have found sketches and draft versions of some of his works, showing that he did engage in revision and refinement.\n\n3. Accounts from contemporaries: Some of Mozart's friends and family members left descriptions of his working methods, though these should still be approached with some caution.\n\nFrom these sources, we can gather that Mozart did have an extraordinary ability to compose quickly and to hold complex musical ideas in his mind. He often worked out compositions mentally before writing them down, but he didn't simply transcribe fully-formed pieces from his imagination as some myths suggest.\n\nMozart was known to compose while engaged in other activities, and he could work on multiple pieces simultaneously. He also had a vast knowledge of musical styles and forms that he could draw upon, which contributed to his speed and fluency in composition.\n\nIt's worth noting that our understanding of Mozart's creative process is still evolving as musicologists continue to study his manuscripts and correspondence. While we have a clearer picture now than in the past, there's still much debate and research ongoing in this area.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of Mozart's compositional methods or the sources we have for understanding them?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-25T09:03:28.620938Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-25T09:03:28.620938Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "56a60bdc-33f5-4b83-a07f-31343c009945", "text": "What did his own, genuine, letters say?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-25T09:05:44.254469Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-25T09:05:44.254469Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "b48d1581-cb70-4aca-a8df-ec16021ec90f", "text": " Mozart's genuine letters provide some insights into his compositional process, though they don't give us a complete picture. Here are some key points from his authentic correspondence:\n\n1. Mental composition: In a letter to his father from 1780, Mozart wrote about composing in his head: \"When I am, as it were, completely myself, entirely alone, and of good cheer...my ideas flow best and most abundantly. Whence and how they come, I know not; nor can I force them.\"\n\n2. Speed of composition: In several letters, Mozart mentions composing quickly. For example, in a 1783 letter to his father, he wrote about composing three piano concertos in a short time: \"These concertos are a happy medium between what is too easy and too difficult; they are very brilliant, pleasing to the ear, and natural, without being vapid.\"\n\n3. Revision process: Contrary to the myth that he never needed to revise, Mozart occasionally mentioned making changes. In a 1784 letter about his string quartets, he wrote: \"I assure you that I took great pains and devoted a long time to composing them.\"\n\n4. Multitasking: In his letters, Mozart often mentions working on multiple pieces simultaneously, suggesting his ability to juggle different compositions in his mind.\n\n5. Inspiration from other composers: Mozart's letters show that he was aware of and sometimes inspired by the work of his contemporaries and predecessors.\n\nIt's important to note that while these letters give us some insight, Mozart didn't write extensively about his creative process. Much of what we know comes from piecing together various comments and references across his correspondence.\n\nWould you like me to expand on any of these points or discuss how these letters compare to other sources of information about Mozart's compositional methods?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-25T09:05:44.254469Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-25T09:05:44.254469Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "7ed697b8-17c1-463c-8f50-423fd7065433", "name": "Building a Turtle RDF Parser in Pharo Smalltalk", "created_at": "2024-07-25T18:38:12.752000Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-25T18:38:21.941194Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "49c49c55-d0da-4a1d-be39-7c393fd79fe9", "text": " To write a parser for Turtle RDF syntax in Pharo Smalltalk, you would need a few key tools and libraries:\n\n1.

STOMP (Smalltalk Object Mapper): While not strictly necessary for parsing, this library can be useful for mapping the parsed RDF triples to Smalltalk objects, which might be helpful depending on how you plan to use the parsed data.\n\n3.

Here's a snippet of how it might look:\n\n```javascript\nimport path from 'path';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'url';\n\nclass TransmissionBuilder {\n  static async build(transmissionConfigFile, servicesConfigFile) {\n    const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);\n    const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);\n    const rootDir = path.resolve(__dirname, '..', 'applications');\n    \n    // ... rest of the build method\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can modify this to pass the `rootDir` to your services. One way to do this is to add it to the `config` object that's passed to each service:\n\n```javascript\nstatic createNodes(transmission, pipenodes, transmissionConfig, servicesConfig) {\n  for (let i = 0; i < pipenodes.length; i++) {\n    // ... existing code ...\n    \n    let service = AbstractServiceFactory.createService(serviceType, servicesConfig);\n    service.rootDir = this.rootDir;  // Add this line\n    \n    // ... rest of the method\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen in your `FileCopy.js` and other services, you can access it like this:\n\n```javascript\nclass FileCopy extends Service {\n    constructor(config) {\n        super(config);\n    }\n\n    async execute(message) {\n        try {\n            const { source, destination } = message;\n            const sourcePath = path.join(this.rootDir, source);\n            const destPath = path.join(this.rootDir, destination);\n\n            // ... rest of the method\n        } catch (err) {\n            logger.error(`FileCopy.execute error: ${err.message}`);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach allows you to set the root directory once when building the transmission and have it available in all services.\n\nQ1: Would you like to see the full implementation of these changes in TransmissionBuilder.js?\nQ2: Should we add any error checking to ensure the rootDir is always set correctly?\nQ3: Are there any other places in your codebase where this rootDir might be useful?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-23T12:12:58.017497Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-23T12:12:58.017497Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "197f9a3c-634b-40d5-a45b-39dfa097ce47", "text": " Certainly.

The error you're encountering suggests that there was a problem mounting your Google Drive to the Colab environment. This can happen for several reasons. Let's try to troubleshoot:\n\n1. First, try running the mount command again. Sometimes, it works on a second attempt:\n\n   ```python\n   from google.colab import drive\n   drive.mount('/content/drive')\n   ```\n\n2. If it fails again, try force remounting:\n\n   ```python\n   drive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount=True)\n   ```\n\n3. If you're still having issues, try clearing your browser cache and cookies, then restart your Colab runtime:\n   - Go to the \"Runtime\" menu\n   - Select \"Restart runtime\"\n   - After restarting, try mounting the drive again\n\n4. Make sure you're logged into the correct Google account in your browser, the one that has access to the Drive you're trying to mount.\n\n5. If none of the above work, you can try an alternative method using the `google.colab` package:\n\n   ```python\n   from google.colab import auth\n   auth.authenticate_user()\n\n   from google.colab import drive\n   drive.mount('/content/drive')\n   ```\n\n6. If you're still encountering issues, it could be due to network problems or temporary issues with Google's services. In this case, you might want to try again later.\n\n7. As a last resort, you can try creating a new Colab notebook and attempting to mount the drive there.\n\nWhen the mount is successful, you should see a URL that you need to visit to authorize Colab to access your Google Drive. After you complete the authorization, the drive should mount successfully.\n\nIf none of these solutions work, please let me know, and we can explore other options or ways to work around this issue.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-20T08:43:29.741260Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-20T08:43:29.741260Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "4695e4c4-0286-4b01-afa8-aa43fbfe6c9d", "text": "how do I clear colab's stdout in the session", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-19T18:58:54.540380Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-19T18:58:54.540380Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "b1beece1-d54e-4e93-98b8-943af9e73ab2", "text": " To clear the stdout (standard output) in a Colab notebook session, you have a few options:\n\n1. Using Python's IPython module:\n\n   ```python\n   from IPython.display import clear_output\n\n   # Clear the current cell's output\n   clear_output()\n\n   # Clear the current cell's output and wait for new output before clearing\n   clear_output(wait=True)\n   ```\n\n2. Using a shell command:\n\n   ```python\n   !clear\n   ```\n\n   or\n\n   ```python\n   %%shell\n   clear\n   ```\n\n3. Using JavaScript to clear all output:\n\n   ```python\n   from IPython.display import Javascript, display\n   display(Javascript('google.colab.output.clearAll()'))\n   ```\n\n4. To clear output of all cells:\n\n   ```python\n   from google.colab import output\n   output.clear()\n   ```\n\n5. If you want to clear output programmatically before each print statement:\n\n   ```python\n   import sys\n   from IPython.display import clear_output\n\n   class ClearingStream:\n       def write(self, text):\n           clear_output(wait=True)\n           print(text, end='')\n\n   sys.stdout = ClearingStream()\n\n   # Now each print will clear previous output\n   print(\"This will clear previous output\")\n   print(\"And this will clear the previous line\")\n   ```\n\nRemember that option 5 will affect all `print` statements in your notebook, so use it cautiously.\n\nAlso, note that clearing output doesn't delete any variables or reset the kernel state. It only clears the visible output in the notebook interface.\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these methods in more detail?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-19T18:58:54.540380Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-19T18:58:54.540380Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "727dd6a8-b0bf-4f02-99c9-904f4d1d3951", "text": "explain frame_%08d.png", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-20T09:52:37.485983Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-20T09:52:37.485983Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "a5f8547f-b7e9-4fc8-90ed-d14e255ea996", "text": " Certainly! The string `frame_%08d.png` is a filename format commonly used in video processing or animation tasks. Let's break it down:\n\n1. `frame_`: This is the base name for each file. It indicates that these files represent individual frames of a video or animation sequence.\n\n2. `%08d`: This is a format specifier for a numeric value:\n   - `%d` indicates that a decimal (integer) number will be inserted here.\n   - `08` specifies that this number should be padded with zeros to always be 8 digits long.\n\n3. `.png`: This is the file extension, indicating that these are PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image files.\n\nSo, when this format is used in a program, it will generate filenames like:\n\n- frame_00000001.png\n- frame_00000002.png\n- frame_00000003.png\n...\n- frame_00000010.png\n- frame_00000011.png\n...\n- frame_00099999.png\n\nThe advantage of this naming convention is:\n\n1. Consistent naming: All frames have the same name length.\n2. Easy sorting: When listed alphabetically, the frames will be in the correct numerical order.\n3. Support for large numbers of frames: The 8-digit format allows for up to 99,999,999 frames.\n\nThis format is often used in video editing, 3D rendering, or any process where you need to output a large number of sequentially numbered image files.

Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. First, define your Python variable:\n\n```python\ndata_root = '/content/drive/MyDrive/colab-data/video-magic/data/'\n```\n\n2. Then, use this variable in your shell command by wrapping the command in an f-string:\n\n```python\n!wget -O '{data_root}rife/rife-ncnn-vulkan-20221029-ubuntu.zip' 'https://github.com/nihui/rife-ncnn-vulkan/releases/download/20221029/rife-ncnn-vulkan-20221029-ubuntu.zip'\n```\n\nOr, you can use the .format() method:\n\n```python\n!wget -O '{0}rife/rife-ncnn-vulkan-20221029-ubuntu.zip' 'https://github.com/nihui/rife-ncnn-vulkan/releases/download/20221029/rife-ncnn-vulkan-20221029-ubuntu.zip'.format(data_root)\n```\n\nBoth of these methods will replace `{data_root}` with the value of the `data_root` variable in the shell command.\n\n3.

It allows for consistent naming of sequential files.\n\nFor example, if `output_folder = \"/path/to/output\"` and you're processing frame number 42, the resulting string would be:\n\n`/path/to/output/frame_0042.png`\n\nThis naming convention ensures that files are named consistently and will sort correctly when listed alphabetically, as all frame numbers will have 4 digits (padded with leading zeros if necessary).\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-19T11:56:13.864101Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-19T11:56:13.864101Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "d37d0ea3-5b56-426e-ac54-b2d93a4d7611", "text": "in .gitignore, how would I specify that I want the dir data/input/ included, but all the files inside it excluded?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-19T13:44:21.818035Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-19T13:44:21.818035Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "f507f612-1c8c-40a3-8e87-8197df2b186e", "text": " To include a directory but exclude all its contents in a .gitignore file, you can use the following syntax:\n\n```\n# Include the directory\n!data/input/\n\n# Exclude everything inside the directory\ndata/input/*\n```\n\nHere's how this works:\n\n1.

Here's an explanation of their purpose and use:\n\n1. Purpose:\n   - Git does not track empty directories. If a directory is completely empty, Git will not include it in the repository.\n   - Sometimes, you want to maintain an empty directory structure in your project, even if there are no files in it yet.\n\n2. How they work:\n   - .gitkeep is not a special file recognized by Git. It's simply a convention.\n   - It's an empty file (or sometimes a file with minimal content) that you create in an otherwise empty directory.\n   - The presence of this file makes the directory non-empty, so Git will track it.\n\n3. Naming:\n   - The name \".gitkeep\" is just a convention. You could use any filename, but \".gitkeep\" is widely recognized among developers.\n   - Some developers use alternative names like \".keep\" or \".placeholder\".\n\n4. Usage:\n   - Create an empty file named .gitkeep in any empty directory you want Git to track.\n   - Commit this file along with your other changes.\n\n5. Benefits:\n   - Maintains project structure in version control.\n   - Useful for directories that will be populated later or by build processes.\n   - Helps other developers understand the intended structure of your project.\n\n6. Example scenario:\n   - You have a 'logs' directory in your project that should exist, but is empty by default.\n   - You'd create a file at logs/.gitkeep to ensure the 'logs' directory is tracked by Git.\n\nRemember, .gitkeep files are a community convention, not a Git feature.

The error you're seeing indicates that the Vulkan library isn't installed in your Colab environment. Even though the unzipped file contains necessary libraries, the system needs Vulkan installed to run the executable.\n\nLet's address this issue:\n\n1. First, we need to install Vulkan. In Colab, you can do this with the following commands:\n\n```python\n!apt update\n!apt install vulkan-utils\n```\n\n2. After installing Vulkan, we need to ensure that the system can find the libraries in the unzipped folder. We can do this by setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH'] = '/content/rife-ncnn-vulkan/rife-ncnn-vulkan-20221029-ubuntu:' + os.environ.get('LD_LIBRARY_PATH', '')\n```\n\n3. Now, let's try running the executable again:\n\n```python\n!/content/rife-ncnn-vulkan/rife-ncnn-vulkan-20221029-ubuntu/rife-ncnn-vulkan -h\n```\n\nIf you're still encountering issues, we might need to investigate further:\n\n4. Check if Vulkan is properly installed:\n\n```python\n!vulkaninfo\n```\n\nThis should display information about your Vulkan installation.\n\n5. List the contents of the unzipped folder to ensure all expected files are present:\n\n```python\n!ls -l /content/rife-ncnn-vulkan/rife-ncnn-vulkan-20221029-ubuntu\n```\n\n6. Check if the libvulkan.so.1 file is present in the system:\n\n```python\n!find / -name \"libvulkan.so.1\" 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nIf these steps don't resolve the issue, it's possible that the pre-compiled binary isn't compatible with the Colab environment. In that case, you might need to consider compiling the software from source in the Colab environment.\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail or suggest next steps if the issue persists?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-19T19:32:56.247505Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-19T19:32:56.247505Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "de432614-6895-4495-8dab-64382ea5069a", "text": " I understand your frustration.

Let's also check if the libvulkan.so.1 file is included in the package:\n\n```python\n!find /content/rife-ncnn-vulkan -name \"libvulkan.so.1\"\n```\n\n4. If the libvulkan.so.1 is present in the package, we can try to force the loader to use it:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ['LD_LIBRARY_PATH'] = '/content/rife-ncnn-vulkan/rife-ncnn-vulkan-20221029-ubuntu:' + os.environ.get('LD_LIBRARY_PATH', '')\n!LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/content/rife-ncnn-vulkan/rife-ncnn-vulkan-20221029-ubuntu:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH /content/rife-ncnn-vulkan/rife-ncnn-vulkan-20221029-ubuntu/rife-ncnn-vulkan -h\n```\n\n5. If it's still not working, we might need to check the Colab GPU information:\n\n```python\n!nvidia-smi\n```\n\n6. And verify if Vulkan is supported:\n\n```python\n!apt update && apt install -y vulkan-tools\n!vulkaninfo\n```\n\nIf after these steps it's still not working, it's possible that the pre-compiled binary is not compatible with the specific environment provided by Colab. In this case, you might need to:\n\na) Contact the package maintainers to see if they have a version that works with Colab.\nb) Consider compiling the software from source in the Colab environment.\nc) Look for alternative implementations that are known to work in Colab.\n\nI apologize for the inconvenience.

First, let's install Vulkan on the Colab instance:\n\n```python\n!apt update && apt install -y libvulkan1\n```\n\n2. After installation, let's check if the Vulkan library is now available on the system:\n\n```python\n!find /usr/lib -name \"libvulkan.so.1\"\n```\n\n3.

Using `time.time()`:\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef long_running_function():\n    # Your function code here\n    time.sleep(5)  # Simulating a long-running process\n\nstart_time = time.time()\nlong_running_function()\nend_time = time.time()\n\nexecution_time = end_time - start_time\nprint(f\"Execution time: {execution_time:.2f} seconds\")\n```\n\n2. Using `time.perf_counter()` (more precise):\n\n```python\nimport time\n\ndef long_running_function():\n    # Your function code here\n    time.sleep(5)  # Simulating a long-running process\n\nstart_time = time.perf_counter()\nlong_running_function()\nend_time = time.perf_counter()\n\nexecution_time = end_time - start_time\nprint(f\"Execution time: {execution_time:.2f} seconds\")\n```\n\n3. Using a decorator (reusable for multiple functions):\n\n```python\nimport time\nfrom functools import wraps\n\ndef measure_time(func):\n    @wraps(func)\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        start_time = time.perf_counter()\n        result = func(*args, **kwargs)\n        end_time = time.perf_counter()\n        execution_time = end_time - start_time\n        print(f\"{func.__name__} execution time: {execution_time:.2f} seconds\")\n        return result\n    return wrapper\n\n@measure_time\ndef long_running_function():\n    # Your function code here\n    time.sleep(5)  # Simulating a long-running process\n\nlong_running_function()\n```\n\n4. For very precise measurements or to run the function multiple times, use `timeit`:\n\n```python\nimport timeit\n\ndef long_running_function():\n    # Your function code here\n    time.sleep(5)  # Simulating a long-running process\n\nexecution_time = timeit.timeit(long_running_function, number=1)\nprint(f\"Execution time: {execution_time:.2f} seconds\")\n```\n\nFor long-running functions in Colab, you might also want to consider using `tqdm` to display a progress bar:\n\n```python\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nimport time\n\ndef long_running_function():\n    for _ in tqdm(range(100)):\n        # Your function code here\n        time.sleep(0.1)  # Simulating a long-running process\n\nstart_time = time.perf_counter()\nlong_running_function()\nend_time = time.perf_counter()\n\nexecution_time = end_time - start_time\nprint(f\"Execution time: {execution_time:.2f} seconds\")\n```\n\nThis will show a progress bar during the function execution, which can be helpful for monitoring long-running processes in Colab.\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these methods in more detail?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-19T20:00:09.426124Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-19T20:00:09.426124Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "ca201def-7fd6-408a-9eec-6ad0a8158160", "text": " To copy everything from the output folder `data/output/` in Colab to your Google Drive, you can use the `shutil` module in Python.

Let's explore this situation:\n\n1. Flatpak Sandbox Behavior:\n   By default, Flatpak applications use a sandboxed environment that is isolated from the rest of the system. This sandbox is typically recreated on each launch of the application.\n\n2. Temporary Storage:\n   Files created within the sandbox that aren't explicitly saved to a persistent location might be stored in temporary directories, which can be cleared on reboot.\n\n3. Potential Recovery Methods:\n   a) Check the Flatpak data directories:\n      Look in ~/.var/app/<app-id>/ where <app-id> is the ID of your Flatpak application.\n   \n   b) Examine temporary directories:\n      Check /tmp/ or /var/tmp/ for any remnants of the file.\n   \n   c) Use file recovery tools:\n      Tools like TestDisk or PhotoRec might be able to recover the file if it hasn't been overwritten.\n\n4. Prevention for the Future:\n   To avoid losing files, ensure you're saving to a persistent location, either within the Flatpak's designated data directory or to a location on the host system that the Flatpak has permission to access.\n\n5. Flatpak Permissions:\n   Some Flatpaks might not have permission to write to certain directories by default. You may need to adjust permissions using flatpak override commands.\n\nWould you like me to provide more detailed steps on any of these recovery methods or explain how to set up proper file saving for your Flatpak application to prevent this in the future?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-14T12:13:33.033377Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-14T12:13:33.033377Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "a6b1ee04-f923-4e93-9b0a-72ee08de93e2", "text": "how do I change this to give a human-friendly file size?\nfind ./ -type f -printf '%s %p\\n' | sort -nr | head -30", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-14T12:27:08.856557Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-14T12:27:08.856557Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "3400c36b-ae6e-4640-9171-a638fb1e736d", "text": " To modify the command to display file sizes in a human-friendly format, you can use the `numfmt` command.

We keep the original `find` command to list files with their sizes.\n2. We still use `sort -nr` and `head -30` to get the top 30 largest files.\n3. We use `awk` to reformat the output slightly, ensuring there's a space between the size and filename.\n4. We pipe this through `numfmt --to=iec --field=1` to convert the file sizes to human-readable format (KiB, MiB, GiB, etc.).\n5. Finally, we sort again with `sort -hr` to maintain the descending order of file sizes.\n\nThis command will display file sizes in units like K (kilobytes), M (megabytes), G (gigabytes), etc., making it much easier to read at a glance.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of this command in more detail?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-14T12:27:08.856557Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-14T12:27:08.856557Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "2b144e7a-9d57-4909-ad81-293940ae695f", "name": "", "created_at": "2024-07-10T16:21:45.424766Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-29T20:01:44.005645Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "6fd52a0c-9fb1-4896-8271-840aae0e45b6", "text": "", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-10T16:21:53.339281Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-11T11:04:21.635504Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "4dd3f14d-cf57-468f-9422-b473ceaf8191", "text": "", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-10T16:21:53.339281Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-11T11:04:21.635504Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "17fe1924-7c5f-4c37-88c8-c3dad0a5e450", "text": "", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-10T16:23:18.944504Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-11T11:04:21.635504Z", "attachments": [{"file_name": "", "file_size": 35355, "file_type": "txt", "extracted_content": ""}], "files": []}, {"uuid": "5d056a20-7347-4a8c-8bb4-e82b8ec7f5b2", "text": "", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-10T16:23:18.944504Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-11T11:04:21.635504Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "9dc3a31e-dc24-4247-9a31-63fe7985cf04", "text": "", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-10T16:35:46.368348Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-11T11:04:21.635504Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "f2d8ed8b-4325-472d-968d-2d15bfd60fd6", "text": "", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-10T16:35:46.368348Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-11T11:04:21.635504Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "085a36e5-2d31-45a4-8c4e-3e280e43244c", "name": "Troubleshooting Git clone issues", "created_at": "2024-07-11T12:19:29.286570Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-12T08:45:59.836245Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "679bb3dd-5c74-4cbd-b85a-5a4233df4586", "text": "I've tried this 3 times, I don't think the network is terribly bad, but :\ngit clone https://github.com/TNTwise/REAL-Video-Enhancer.git\nCloning into 'REAL-Video-Enhancer'...\nremote: Enumerating objects: 11553, done.\nremote: Counting objects: 100% (2573/2573), done.\nremote: Compressing objects: 100% (819/819), done.\nerror: RPC failed; curl 18 transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining\nerror: 984 bytes of body are still expected\nfetch-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet\nfatal: early EOF\nfatal: fetch-pack: invalid index-pack output", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-11T12:19:38.157329Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-11T12:19:38.157329Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "48649843-918a-4eba-88aa-45d516fab04a", "text": " It seems you're encountering an issue while trying to clone the REAL-Video-Enhancer repository from GitHub.

Here's a guide on how to handle different update scenarios:\n\n1. Updating all packages:\n\nFrom the root of your monorepo, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpm update\n```\n\nThis will update all packages in all workspaces to their latest versions according to the version ranges specified in their package.json files.\n\n2. Updating a specific package across all workspaces:\n\n```bash\nnpm update <package-name> -ws\n```\n\nThe `-ws` flag tells npm to run the command in all workspaces.\n\n3. Updating packages in a specific workspace:\n\n```bash\nnpm update -w packages/<app-name>\n```\n\nThis updates all packages in the specified workspace.\n\n4. Updating a specific package in a specific workspace:\n\n```bash\nnpm update <package-name> -w packages/<app-name>\n```\n\n5. Checking for outdated packages:\n\nTo see which packages are outdated across all workspaces:\n\n```bash\nnpm outdated -ws\n```\n\n6. Upgrading to major versions:\n\nThe update command respects semver ranges in your package.json. To upgrade to new major versions:\n\n```bash\nnpm upgrade -ws\n```\n\nThis will update your package.json files with the new versions.\n\n7. Updating devDependencies in the root:\n\n```bash\nnpm update --dev\n```\n\n8. Updating the common package in all applications:\n\nIf you've made changes to your common package and want to update its version in all applications:\n\na. First, increment the version in packages/common/package.json\nb. Then, from the root directory, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @my-monorepo/common@latest -ws\n```\n\nThis will update the common package to the latest version in all workspaces.\n\nRemember to commit your package.json and package-lock.json files after making updates.

I can help you set up a monorepo structure for your applications using the tools you've mentioned. Here's a recommended setup that follows best practices:\n\n1. First, create the monorepo root directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir my-monorepo\ncd my-monorepo\n```\n\n2. Initialize the root-level package.json:\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\n```\n\n3. Create a directory structure:\n\n```\nmy-monorepo/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 packages/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 farelo/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 trellis/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 strandz/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 common/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 docs/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tests/\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 package.json\n```\n\n4. Set up each application and the common package:\n\n```bash\ncd packages\nmkdir farelo trellis strandz common\ncd ..\n```\n\n5. Initialize each package:\n\n```bash\ncd packages/farelo\nnpm init -y\ncd ../trellis\nnpm init -y\ncd ../strandz\nnpm init -y\ncd ../common\nnpm init -y\ncd ../..\n```\n\n6. Update the root package.json to use Workspaces:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-monorepo\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"workspaces\": [\n    \"packages/*\"\n  ],\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"jasmine\",\n    \"docs\": \"jsdoc -c jsdoc.json\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"chai\": \"^4.3.7\",\n    \"jasmine\": \"^4.6.0\",\n    \"jsdoc\": \"^4.0.2\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n7. Install the dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n8. Set up JSDoc configuration (jsdoc.json in the root):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"source\": {\n    \"include\": [\"packages\"],\n    \"excludePattern\": \"(node_modules|docs)\"\n  },\n  \"opts\": {\n    \"destination\": \"./docs/\",\n    \"recurse\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n9. Set up Jasmine (spec/support/jasmine.json in the root):\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p spec/support\ntouch spec/support/jasmine.json\n```\n\nAdd the following to jasmine.json:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"spec_dir\": \"tests\",\n  \"spec_files\": [\n    \"**/*[sS]pec.js\"\n  ],\n  \"helpers\": [\n    \"helpers/**/*.js\"\n  ],\n  \"stopSpecOnExpectationFailure\": false,\n  \"random\": true\n}\n```\n\n10. Create a basic structure for each application:\n\n```bash\nfor dir in packages/*; do\n  mkdir -p \"$dir\"/{src,tests,public}\n  touch \"$dir\"/src/index.js\n  touch \"$dir\"/public/index.html\ndone\n```\n\n11. Set up the common package:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p packages/common/{src,tests}\ntouch packages/common/src/index.js\n```\n\n12.

For Maven, you'll need the following dependencies:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.shiro</groupId>\n    <artifactId>shiro-core</artifactId>\n    <version>1.9.1</version>\n</dependency>\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.shiro</groupId>\n    <artifactId>shiro-web</artifactId>\n    <version>1.9.1</version>\n</dependency>\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.shiro</groupId>\n    <artifactId>shiro-ldap</artifactId>\n    <version>1.9.1</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n2. **Configure Shiro**\nCreate a `shiro.ini` file in your project's resources folder and configure Shiro to use LDAP for authentication. Here's an example configuration:\n\n```ini\n[main]\nldapRealm = org.apache.shiro.realm.ldap.JndiLdapRealm\nldapRealm.userDnTemplate = uid={0},ou=people,dc=example,dc=com\nldapRealm.contextFactory.environment[java.naming.provider.url] = ldap://ldap.example.com:389\n\nsecurityManager.realms = $ldapRealm\n\n[urls]\n/fuseki = authcBasic\n```\n\nReplace the `userDnTemplate` and `java.naming.provider.url` values with the appropriate values for your LDAP server.\n\n3. **Initialize Shiro**\nIn your application's startup code, initialize Shiro and bind it to the web environment. For example, in a Servlet-based application, you can create a `ShiroFilter` and map it to the application's URL patterns:\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.shiro.web.env.EnvironmentLoaderListener;\n\npublic class ShiroEnvironmentLoaderListener extends EnvironmentLoaderListener {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nAnd in your `web.xml` file, map the `ShiroFilter` to the desired URL patterns:\n\n```xml\n<filter>\n    <filter-name>ShiroFilter</filter-name>\n    <filter-class>org.apache.shiro.web.servlet.ShiroFilter</filter-class>\n</filter>\n\n<filter-mapping>\n    <filter-name>ShiroFilter</filter-name>\n    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>\n</filter-mapping>\n\n<listener>\n    <listener-class>com.example.ShiroEnvironmentLoaderListener</listener-class>\n</listener>\n```\n\n4. **Configure Fuseki**\nIn Fuseki's configuration file (`run.sh` or `fuseki.properties`), set the authentication mechanism to `basic` and configure the `realm` to use the Shiro `IniRealm`:\n\n```\n# Authentication settings\nfuseki.auth.methods=basic\nfuseki.auth.basic.realm=org.apache.shiro.realm.text.IniRealm\n```\n\nWith these configurations, Fuseki will use Shiro for authentication, and Shiro will use the configured LDAP server for user authentication.\n\nNote that this is a basic setup, and you may need to adjust the configuration based on your specific requirements, such as secure LDAP connections, user/group mappings, and additional security configurations.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-04-18T22:16:32.202576Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-18T22:16:32.202576Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "0c0f981d-0883-47c8-9689-f8a6ada6bbb0", "name": "An Interactive Fiction Adventure Awaits", "created_at": "2024-03-29T15:09:55.439036Z", "updated_at": "2024-03-29T15:10:14.392945Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "580798d5-d5a3-4f40-8ffa-73282326275c", "text": " I've studied the provided Ink-based interactive fiction experience, and I'll create an immersive, choice-driven adventure for you using emojis and generated images.

This profile document is hosted somewhere on the web, often on the user's own Solid pod or server.\n\nTo authenticate with Solid Community Server using WebID, users provide the URL of their WebID profile document.

The most common fluid employed is water, or a mixture of water-glycol to avoid freezing [23,37,48], although refrigerants capable to undergo phase change at relatively low temperatures have been used to integrate these collectors with HPs [23, 28]. 2.2.1. Water-based PV-T collectors Water-based collectors are considered the most efficient type of PV-T technology for applications where water preheating is required all year long at locations with high solar input and high ambient temperature (low latitudes) [35,48,73,118]. In recent decades, significant research has been undertaken on this type of collector, giving rise to a large number of water-based PV-T system configurations, both in terms of materials and geometries [28,34,35,41,48]. Here it should be noted that this section considers both water and water-glycol mixtures as the heat transfer fluid without a specific differentiation. From the different de - signs found in literature, the main design concepts are [23,28,34,35,41, 48,119] (see Fig. 7): Copper is the most widely used material for several reasons, including primarily its high thermal conductivity. The most common PV-T collector design comprises a metallic sheet-and-tube absorber adhered to the rear of PV cells in which the liquid is circulated via forced convection through pipes connected in series or parallel (Design (a) in Fig. 7) [23,28,41,121]. Furthermore, the most common collector design features parallel pipes (Fig. 8) with diameters of 6 \u2013 7 mm [122,123], 8 mm [121,122,124], 10 mm [27,71,125,126], 15 mm [74] (see Table 3); while serpentine arrangements are typically used in refrigerant-based PV-T collectors (see Section 2.2.2). Investigators have analysed serpentine water-based PV-T collectors with tube diameters of 10 mm [127] or 8 mm [128]. Table 3 summarizes the main outcomes of previous research on these types of configurations. Alternatively, web-flow, direct-flow (also called parallel-pipes) or spiral-flow designs (Fig. 8) made of stainless steel have been also ana - lysed by other authors [119,129]. The results show that, at an outlet temperature of 50 \u2013 65 \u25e6 C, the web-flow design performs the worst, with thermal efficiencies from 41% to 48% depending on the flow rate, the direct-flow design performs slightly better (46 \u2013 54%), while the spiral-flow design performs the best, with thermal efficiencies of 58 \u2013 68%, and the highest electrical efficiencies (13 \u2013 14%), due to the lower PV cell temperature [129].

M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 10 Each of the aforementioned configurations can be further divided depending on the number of covers (zero, one or two; see Table 3), whether an opaque or transparent PV panel is used or whether they have an additional transparent insulating layer between the channels (Design (d) in Fig. 7) [120]. Most of the studies apply the cooling water at the rear of the PV cells, with a reflective Tedlar layer in between, decreasing the efficiency of the heat extraction. There are several ways to overcome this problem, such as using a different layer (Tedlar-polyester-Tedlar) Fig. 7. Cross-section of some common water-based PV-T collector designs [35,36,120].

The two-absorber PV-T collector (Design (d) in Fig. 7) uses a transparent PV laminate as a primary absorber and a black metal absorber as a secondary absorber, with water flowing in through the upper channel and then returning in the opposite direction through the lower one (underneath the PV laminate) [120, 130]. PV cells receive most of the visible radiation as glass and water have high transmittance, and the infrared part of the solar spectrum is mostly absorbed by water, which also cools the solar cells preventing the decrease in efficiency due to an increase in the cell temperature [75]. The results show that this design achieves higher thermal efficiency than a single-cover sheet-and-tube PV-T collector (66% vs . 58% respectively at zero reduced temperature [120]; see Table 3), but the transparent PV laminates are more expensive and this design is heavier and more fragile due to the larger amount of glass required [120,130]. Another alterna - tive is to let the fluid flow over the absorber (free flow panel, Design (b) in Fig. 7) [131], but the results show that evaporation strongly reduces the thermal efficiency and the condensate on top of the glass causes additional reflection, so the authors concluded that water is not an appropriate choice for this type of collectors [120]. Amongst the various thermal absorber configurations for PV-T col - lectors found in the relevant literature, those featuring parallel tubes (sheet-and-tube) are the most common [27,120,125,134 \u2013 136], with high TRLs of 9. Most of the water-based PV-T collectors commercially available are based on thermally attaching mono-crystalline PV cells on top of flat-plate solar collectors [91,92,137 \u2013 140]. According to the market survey undertaken under Task 60 [25,92], most of the PV-T manufacturers focus on liquid-based PV-T collectors, particularly on uncovered water-based PV-T collectors (48%), such as Caotec, DualSun, Fototherm, Meyer Burger, Racell, Solator, Solink; followed by covered water-based PV-T collectors (28%), such as Abora Solar, EndeF, Solvis; and vacuum tube PV-T collectors (4%), such as Naked Energy [92]. 2.2.2. Refrigerant-based PV-T collectors In refrigerant-based PV-T collectors, the PV-T collector usually acts as the evaporator of an HP [141], forming the so-called PV-T-SAHP [23, 68]. Here, direct expansion evaporation coils are integrated underneath the PV cells (see Fig. 9), so when the refrigerant flows through the modules it evaporates at low temperatures (0 \u2013 20 \u25e6 C) [41,142], cooling down the PV cells. This allows the PV cells to operate at low tempera - tures and therefore achieve higher electrical efficiencies [143,144]. Typically these collectors have a serpentine design made of copper coils [146] of around 6 \u2013 7 mm inner diameter [143,144,147 \u2013 150], but there are also examples of copper parallel tubes of larger (10 mm) inner diameters [151] (see Fig. 9). Meanwhile, Mohanraj et al. [152] proposed to alternate circular tubes of 9.52 mm with equilateral triangular tubes of 12 mm to increase the heat transfer area and thus absorb more thermal energy. The results showed a 4 \u2013 13% higher electrical efficiency and 4 \u2013 9% higher evaporator heat gain compared to a circular tube configuration. Tsai [153] proposed a rooftop PV-T collector where multi-port copper tubes assembled in parallel are attached to the rear surface of the PV cells. In this line, a more recent work analysed a serpentine microchannel PV-T collector integrated into an opaque ventilated fa\u00e7ade [154]. Alternatively, Xu et al. [142] proposed multi-port flat extruded aluminium tubes of 3.35 \u00d7 3 mm channels, increasing the contact sur - face, enhancing heat transfer and thus increasing the thermal efficiency by 6%. A similar design was proposed by Zhou et al. [155], where microchannel rectangular pipes (2 \u00d7 6 mm) are welded to the absorber plate of the PV-T collector (see Table 4). They concluded that this design improved heat transfer while reducing manufacturing costs due to the smaller size and weight. More recently, other authors have proposed a roll-bond design with serpentine aluminium coils as the PV-T collector evaporator [156,157]. In an attempt to reduce thermal losses, another study [158] proposed a glass vacuum tube PV-T collector, with a U-shape copper tube of 6 mm as the evaporator and a-Si PV cells. There are also examples of refrigerant-based CPV-T collectors, such as the one proposed by Xu et al. [159], where a multi-port flat extruded aluminium tube in a serpentine format acts as the evaporator of a low-concentrated PV-T parabolic collector (concentration ratio of 1.6). Also in related work, the experimental study by Fang et al. [151] concluded that a refrigerant-based PV-T can improve the electrical effi - ciency by 24% relative to that of a conventional PV panel, due to the lower operating temperatures of the PV cells in the former. Similar results have been recently found by Vaishak and Bhale [149]. Several studies also concluded that the COP and the condenser heat capacity decrease with the increase in condenser water supply temperature [147,158]. Different refrigerants have been used as working fluids, such as R134A, R12, R22 [144,145,150,157,160], R410A [155], R600A, R407C [161] or R404A [68] (see Table 4). The performance analysis has shown that R12 and R22 outperform other fluids (e.g., can achieve a higher COP), but in turn, they have a negative environmental impact [162]. R134A is used in most of the reported studies [147,153,154,158,159, 163], which has a similar performance to R12 and R22 [162], while it is more environmentally friendly [68]. Among the others, R410A is more efficient than R407C and R404A, and despite its lower (15 \u2013 20%) per - formance than R134A [162], it has been identified as an ideal substitute because of its good chemical and thermal stability [68,155]. Previous research on refrigerant-based PV-T collectors has mainly focussed on: (a) analysing the influence of different design factors (top cover, PV cells, evaporation and condensation temperatures of the HP) on the system efficiencies [144,147,158]; (b) optimizing the collector design (geometrical shape, diameter size or packing factor) [145,164]; (c) analysing the experimental performance of the PV-T collector and its integration with an HP [144,149,151,153,157,160]; and (d) assessing the annual performance of the PV-T-SAHP system in one [149] or several [142] geographical locations. Refrigerant-based PV-T collectors usually have larger electrical ef - ficiencies than air- or water-based PV-T collectors, due to the lower operating temperature of the PV cells [37,41], but they have some dis - advantages such as the high risk of refrigerant leakage [41], uneven refrigerant distribution in evaporation tubes [165,166], potentially Fig. 9. Schematic of refrigerant-based PV-T collector [68,145]. M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 12 induced degradation, delamination and UV degradation [68], or the need of a perfect seal in the refrigerant cycle to prevent air entering the system during operation [41]. Recently, Vaishak and Bhale [68] stated that some of these limitations might be overcome to some extent by heat-pipe PV-T collectors (see Section 2.3 for more details). The most common refrigerant-based PV-T configurations have a TRL of 7 \u2013 8, consisting of a PV-T-SAHP system where the PV-T collector acts as the HP evaporator. However, according to the market survey of Task 60 [92], currently, there are no manufacturers of this type of PV-T collector. 2.3. Heat-pipe PV-T collectors Heat pipes are highly efficient heat-transfer devices that have been widely used in various fields such as spacecraft and electronics cooling. Heat pipes have the advantages of high heat transfer rates, no moving parts, no energy consumption, and long service lifetimes, among others [167]. A typical heat pipe usually consists of two main sections: the evaporator and the condenser (see Fig. 10). The evaporator absorbs heat and evaporates the working fluid, which is then condensed in the condenser, releasing heat. Heat pipes have an ultra-high heat transfer effectiveness due to the phase change process. Considering the afore - mentioned advantages, heat pipes have been applied to PV-T collectors, specifically for the effective removal of waste heat in PV cells, and it is thought that heat-pipe PV-T collectors may have the potential to over - come some of the problems refrigerant-based PV-T collectors [41]. Fig. 10 shows a schematic of a heat-pipe PV-T collector. The heat pipe is tightly attached to the back side of PV cells to absorb residual heat. The heat is then transported through the heat pipe and recovered by a fluid at the condensation end of the heat pipe, which can then be delivered for downstream use. The heat pipe can be considered a heat-transfer me - dium with a very high thermal conductivity. Two main types of heat pipe have been applied to heat-pipe PV-T collectors, specifically microchannel flat heat pipes [168,169] and cy - lindrical heat pipes [170 \u2013 172]. Fig. 11 shows a heat-pipe PV-T collector designed and tested by Pei et al. [173]. An array of cylindrical copper heat pipes was attached to the bottom of the PV cells, and the waste heat was removed and transported through the heat pipe array into the water box at the top of the panel. The system daily thermal efficiency increased from 45% to 55% as the heat pipe number increased from 5 to 15 [172]. The heat-pipe PV-T collector has an anti-freezing ability if the working fluid is selected appropriately and thus has a better performance in cold regions compared to conventional water-based collectors [173]. Low-boiling point refrigerants (e.g., R134A) can be used as working fluids in cold regions to overcome the freezing problem [170].

Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 13 their high equivalent thermal conductivity, heat pipes maintain a uni - form temperature distribution over the PV cells. The temperature dif - ference between PV cells cooled by heat pipes was found to be less than 2.5 \u25e6 C in the outdoor experiments of Wu et al. [174]. The performance of a heat-pipe PV-T collector with microchannel flat heat pipes in different seasons was investigated by Hou et al. [169], who found that the ther - mal efficiency was over 40% in summertime. Overall, the thermal effi - ciency of a heat-pipe PV-T collector strongly depends on its structure, the working fluid and the distribution of the heat pipe array, and typi - cally varies from around 40% [169,172] to 60% [172,174,175]. Heat pipes are particularly effective at removing the high-flux waste heat in concentrated PV panels. In this context, the experimental results by Farahat [176] showed that the heat pipe delivered a more effective and reliable cooling for the concentrated PV panel compared to a con - ventional water cooling method. A concentrated heat-pipe PV-T system with a microchannel heat pipe was built and tested by Chen et al. [168], reaching thermal and electrical efficiencies of 55% and 15%, respec - tively, with the solar panel temperature at about 60 \u25e6 C. Attempts have also been made to convert recovered thermal energy from PV-T collectors into additional (secondary) electricity, e.g., using an integrated heat-pipe PV-T and thermoelectric generator (TEG) module design in which the condenser section of the heat pipe was directly contacted with the TEG [177,178]. In such applications, TEGs are in competition with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power systems (discussed further in Section 4.1.1), Stirling engines, etc., whose effi - ciency and cost are both scale and temperature-dependent [179]. However, the economic viability of using a secondary power system to recover and convert excess PV-T thermal energy remains low at present, due to the inherently low efficiency of the secondary power system at temperatures below 100 \u25e6 C, the added complexity and cost, and the alternative of generating additional electricity by increasing the total installed PV-T or PV area. In any case, experimental results showed that the PV cell temperature in the proposed PV-TEG-microchannel heat-pipe collector without insulation was 6 \u25e6 C lower than that in the PV-only baseline panel (61.9 \u25e6 C and 67.9 \u25e6 C, respectively) after 1 h of opera - tion, and that the electrical efficiency of the proposed hybrid collector without insulation was 12.2%, compared to the 12% of the PV-only panel. The TRL of this type of PV-T collector strongly depends on the specific configuration, with most of the configurations still at a TRL of 6 \u2013 7. Currently, there is one UK manufacturer of vacuum-tube PV-T collectors [92]. 2.4. Dual air \u2013 water PV-T collectors Dual air \u2013 water PV-T collectors have appeared in an attempt to overcome the limitations of both air- and water-based PV-T collectors. These collectors are designed to operate either heating water (usually in periods of higher ambient temperatures) or heating air (mainly when the ambient temperature is low), depending also on the end-user needs. It is also possible to operate both heat extraction modes either under mild weather conditions or when both hot water and air are needed. Dual air \u2013 water PV-T collectors can achieve total efficiencies of about 55% and 70% for air and water heat extraction modes, respectively [73]. Different configurations have been studied [41,48,73], concluding that the best option is to have water channels in thermal contact with the PV cell rear surface and the air heat exchangers below it, also acting as thermal insulation [180], as shown in Fig. 12 [73,181]. Dual air \u2013 water PV-T collectors combine the advantages of water- and air-based collectors. To increase the amount of heat extraction using water, the number of water pipes can be increased, which is beneficial for the thermal efficiency but further increases the costs. Cost-effective fins or ribs can be added to the air channel to improve the heat trans - fer coefficient [73]. An experiment was conducted by Ji et al. [182] to investigate the real outdoor performance of a dual air \u2013 water PV-T col - lector in different working modes. The thermal efficiencies of the water-heating and air-heating modes at zero reduced temperature reached 44% and 57%, while the electrical efficiency was around 10%. Ma et al. [183] added an additional air-flowing channel with fins above the PV cells. The air flowed through both the channels above and beneath the PV cells. The thermal efficiencies of the water-heating and air-heating modes reached 50% and 55%, respectively, while the elec - trical efficiency was not reported. A noteworthy advantage of dual air \u2013 water PV-T collectors arises from their overall versatility, even though they are slightly more com - plex and expensive than typical water-based PV-T collectors. They can take advantage of the dual heat extraction to avoid freezing in cold climates, shifting to heat air when required. These systems can be used in houses, residential and office buildings, mainly for operation at low temperatures, providing a cost-effective solution with a flexible output [41,73]. This type of PV-T collector has a lower TRL of 6 \u2013 7 with no manufacturers of this type of PV-T collector [92]. 2.5. Building-integrated PV-T collectors When PV cells are installed either on the facades or roofs of a building creating the external structure or skin of the building, they are referred to as building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) collectors. BIPV systems are used mainly to produce electricity, but also provide hot air for space heating, which is an added benefit. When the heated air is used to cover part of the building heating load, the system is called a building- integrated PV-T (BIPV-T) system. By simultaneously serving as a building envelope material and a power generator, BIPV-T systems can offer savings in materials and electricity costs, thus reducing the use of fossil fuels and the relevant CO 2 emissions and offering an architectural enhancement to the build - ing. Furthermore, PV panels can be integrated in such a way to provide additional functions like shading, active solar heating and lighting. The advantages of BIPV-T systems are many so they have attracted the in - terest of engineers and architects. In literature, a lot of successful pro - jects are published from around the world. Most of these are applications for residential and commercial buildings. Recently, PV panels are pro - duced as standard building products and a whole new market is created around BIPV-T systems [184]. As a BIPV-T panel is part of a building envelope it must be able to provide weather protection, thermal insu - lation and noise protection [185] and perform these functions without affecting the structural strength or integrity of the building. In addition to the electrical and thermal energy produced, BIPV-T may also allow daylight entry, through semi-transparent modules, thus providing the view of the outside environment so as the building occupants do not feel confined. An added important advantage of BIPV-T systems is that they can function as an attractive architectural element affecting positively the appearance of a building. The idea of transforming buildings from energy users to energy producers is not new. Solutions involving the integration of PV cells into the building envelope appeared almost at the same time as the first PV panels entered the market. The first installation of a BIPV curtain wall fa\u00e7ade appeared in Aachen, Germany in 1991 [186]. The need to increase the energy efficiency of buildings and reduce emissions are the main drivers for the continued uptake of BIPV-T products. Most countries promote such systems by funding part of the Fig. 12. Schematic of dual air \u2013 water PV-T collector [73,181]. M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 14 installation costs and by providing attractive feed-in tariffs applicable to the use of BIPV products [187]. The present size of the global BIPV market is about 2.3 GW (or ~1% of the global PV market), with Europe constituting the largest market (42% of the global market) in particular due to attractive incentives in France, Italy and Germany [188]. The annual installed capacity of BIPV systems worldwide is expected to reach 32.3 GW by 2024 [189]. BIPV-T systems represent a favourable solution for clean electricity production combined with renewable cooling or heating while reducing the energy demand at the same time. It is estimated that air-based BIPV- T systems have the potential to reduce the primary energy required for heating and cooling from conventional systems by 30% [190], and in preheating applications where the fluid temperature is kept low, such as in combined PV-T-HP systems, the electrical output can be enhanced by 4 \u2013 10% compared to an equivalent non-cooled PV system [191]. They should be applied to buildings usually after other energy-saving mea - sures are taken and they should be economically examined in terms of their lifecycle cost, and not from their initial first cost because the initial expenditure is substantially reduced by the avoidance of the traditional building materials they replace. One important design consideration for BIPV-T systems is whether natural ventilation or mechanical ventilation is used to move the air in the gap between the PV cells and the wall or roof of the building. In the case of solar fa\u00e7ades with installed PV panels, the need for ventilated PV cladding is very important, otherwise, due to the high temperature reached by the PV cells, there will be a loss of efficiency and the development of undesirable heat gain to the building, which espe - cially during the summer period could create extra cooling load. Unless provisions are not made to remove the hot air created between the PV cells and the wall of the building, the BIPV panels get warmer than the ones mounted in free air, consequently lowering more their electrical power output. To solve this problem, efficient ways to extract the heat by forced or natural fluid circulation have to be devised. There are a lot of studies trying to optimize the air gap between the PV cells back sur - face and the building element for air circulation, either by forced or natural flow, for cooling the PV arrays. Some studies on naturally ventilated systems are [192 \u2013 201], and on mechanically ventilated sys - tems [202 \u2013 208]. Although the natural convection analysis of the BIPV systems seems complex and inconvenient, it is believed that it has many potentials and is worth better examination due to its advantages [196]. Moreover, various researchers studied the thermal effects in the air gap between the PV cells and the building wall [199,209 \u2013 216] and numerous studies are focussed on the heat transfer analysis between the two skins [190,217 \u2013 220]. PV cells for building integration are usually installed on flat or in - clined roofs, on fa\u00e7ades and as shading elements close to windows or even inside window glazing. According to a recent review [221], roof-mounted systems hold 80% of the BIPV market, and fa\u00e7ade- - mounted systems account for the rest of the installations. Roof-mounted systems include roof-integrated shingles, skylights, atria and roof panels, and fa\u00e7ade-mounted systems include the shading systems, cladding and curtain walls. One possible classification of BIPV-T systems has been provided in a recently published review [222], based on the application, while other studies provide alternative categorizations of BIPV-T systems based on the type of panels and their operation principles [223]. Recently, some authors presented a comparative review of the BIPV systems in selected EU countries, showing that Europe has been the leader in BIPV system development from 2014 to 2020 followed by the USA and Asia [224]. The need to develop more advanced BIPV-T system designs with improved performance has persisted over the years. Architects, engi - neers and users agreed that their preferences for the systems were relevant to the appearance of the systems and their performance. Thus, various design configurations were developed. Some of them are double- skin systems with air passing between the two skins for overheating prevention, transparent and semi-transparent PV panels [225 \u2013 230], roof-integrated PV panels, replacing the conventional roof tiles called PV shingles, fa\u00e7ade applications for curtain walls, glazing windows ap - plications, and shading elements applications. Schematics of the most used configurations of BIPV/BIPV-T systems are shown in Fig. 13 as given by Agathokleous and Kalogirou [231]. Fig. 13(a) shows a PV panel in full contact with a building wall. Various studies have examined this design and concluded that it is inefficient due to the overheating of both the PV panels and the building \u2019 s interior spaces [207,232 \u2013 237]. Fig. 13(b) shows a BIPV system that addresses these problems, by rejecting the heated air, while in Fig. 13(c) a BIPV-T system is shown that uses the heated air for space heating through an air duct in the ceiling. Fig. 13(d), (e), (f) and (g) show roof BIPV and BIPV-T systems; the first one rejects the heated air behind the PV panels and the other three, use the heated air for space heating with ducts or roof air circulation. Fig. 13(h) and (i) show BIPV applications with semi-transparent PV cells which provide indoor natural light as well. Other BIPV applications are the use of BIPV as shading elements and BIPV systems which are also used to provide hot water, connected with pumps and water tanks. Another work studied another configuration of the system named BIPV Trombe wall (BIPV-TW). These systems can provide heating/cooling and generate electricity simultaneously [238]. Another interesting configuration gaining attention recently is the use of PCMs for thermal regulation enhancement of BIPV-T systems [239]. A study where two PCMs were used on the thermal regulation performance of BIPV systems is given by Huang [240] where it is shown that the PV-PCM system with two types of PCM can maintain the PV cells at operating temperature closer to its characteristic value of 25 \u25e6 C and thus lead to an improvement in solar-to-electrical conversion efficiency under variable diurnal insolation. The most used BIPV-PCM system in the market looks like the schematic representation of Fig. 14, which provides heat transfer enhancement in the interior, with radiation [231]. Various investigators have performed case studies, investigating real-size BIPV and BIPV-T applications or prototypes [241 \u2013 253] and life cycle assessment of BIPV systems [247,254]. A considerable number of researchers have attempted to extend our knowledge of the behaviour of BIPV systems by investigating the flow, heat transfer and optical char - acteristics of the systems [187,255 \u2013 257]. It is known that BIPV systems often reach higher temperatures than standalone systems and this leads to a performance drop. For this reason, accurate thermal modelling of BIPV systems is very important before their installation to evaluate their contribution to the reduction of building energy needs. In this context, several thermal modelling tools have been developed to estimate the operating cell temperatures of PV cells in BIPV systems because they directly affect the performance of the system. Some studies [194,258] investigated the effect of the naturally ventilated air gap of vertical double-skin BIPV systems and provided correlations for the estimation of the convective heat transfer co - efficients for the calculation of the heat transfer rate in the air channel. Friling et al. [206] performed mathematical modelling of the heat transfer dynamics of BIPV systems, showing that the heat transfer rate increases when forced ventilation velocity is increased which was more or less expected. Another study [259] presented the results of a simu - lation study performed in TRNSYS with the use of the existing types of TRNSYS for BIPV and BIPV-T systems considering only a forced venti - lation system. Forced ventilation systems have also been investigated [260,261]. Bigaila et al. [260] performed an experimental study with emphasis on the cell temperature and the air gap heat transfer analysis whereas in another study Rounis et al. [262] investigated the wind ef - fects and fan-induced suction in a multiple-inlet BIPV-T system. There are also various studies on the performance of BIPV systems [225,245,263 \u2013 267], which can be categorized into simulation model - ling, experimental and case studies. The electrical and thermal effi - ciencies of BIPV systems depend on the type of PV used, on the climatic conditions as well as on the configuration of the system, the type of cooling method and the type of integration, among others. A comparison M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 15 between the different configurations in terms of efficiency is difficult to perform due to all these related parameters. Table 5 summarizes the main types of BIPV systems and shows efficiency estimations obtained in previous research. Based on these findings, it is concluded that the size of the air gap, the inclination angle of the collector, the height of the system and the type of PCM are critical parameters for the performance of BIPV systems. It can be generally concluded that BIPV systems with open-ended air channels have better cooling performance and thus higher electrical efficiency than the systems with closed air ducts, and that BIPV systems with PCMs have better thermal performance than the air-based BIPV systems due to the storage ability of the PCMs. Yoo [274] performed a simulation for BIPV shading device optimi - zation through parameter variation, studying the first practical appli - cation of a semi-transparent BIPV system in Korea. The performance of the system was investigated through long-term system monitoring and simulation modelling. Ghani et al. [276] estimated the PV cell conver - sion efficiency of BIPV-T systems using an artificial neural network, while another study [277] investigated the effect of roof configurations Fig. 13. Selected BIPV-T system configurations. Figure from Agathokleous and Kalogirou [231], used with permission from Elsevier. M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 16 on the performance of BIPV systems. An experimental study of a low-cost passive strategy to improve the performance of BIPV systems was undertaken by Yang and Athienitis [278]. A performance evaluation of an air-based BIPV-T system with multiple inlets in a cold climate concluded that no more than four air inlets are needed to provide suf - ficient PV cell cooling [279]. Other investigators performed energy analyses and verification studies of BIPV cells in buildings with building information modelling, and the simulation results were compared to data measured over 3 years [280]. More recently, the performance of a BIPV-T system with PV cells installed at the optimum tilt angle and influenced by shadow was assessed [281], as was the performance of three types of BIPV-TW systems [238]. The influence of a BIPV system on the heating and cooling loads of the building with one-dimensional transient model analysis, for Tianjin, China, was analysed by Wang et al. [282]. A ventilated air gap BIPV system was compared to a non-ventilated system, close roof system and a conventional roof with no PV cells and no air gap. It was concluded that in summer the optimum system is the ventilated air gap which leads to higher conversion efficiency but in winter, the non-ventilated air duct is appropriate. A real system investigation was also done by Aste et al. [283] in the first Italian BIPV project. The system was in operation for 13 years which is representative because it can be considered as about half of the sup - posed lifetime cycle of a PV system. The results obtained show that the PV plant analysed did not present a significant decrease in long-term performance. The measured performance ratio decay was just under 0.4% per year. Azadian and Radzi [284] investigated the optimization assessment of the energy performance of a BIPV-T PCM system using genetic algo - rithms. The overall energy efficiency of the system was evaluated for winter and summer conditions adopting different utilization strategies, and optimized designs were identified. The thermal and electrical effi - ciencies were calculated, and the results showed that such systems can achieve a maximum overall efficiency of 64% in a winter configuration and 32% in a summer configuration. Given the important benefits of BIPV systems, key factors that can influence their performance have been investigated as part of an effort to improve these systems. Such factors include the operating temperature, irradiation conditions, optical losses and changes to the solar spectrum. Additionally, although there is increasing uptake of installations, there are still some important barriers that affect their exploitation such as concerning feed-in tariff implementation, public acceptance and wider government support [231,285,286]. Some authors [272,287] have reported results from investigations in which water-based PV-T collectors were integrated within roofs, giving rise to roof-mounted water-based BIPV-T systems. They concluded that the electrical and thermal performance of these systems is affected by some key design parameters such as the fin efficiency, lamination re - quirements and the thermal conductivity between the PV cells and the supporting structure [287]. The results also showed better cost savings when these units use a natural circulation system, obtaining an esti - mated payback time of around 14 years in warm climate locations [272]. Another study on the effect of flow distribution on the PV cell per - formance in water-based BIPV-T collectors stated that parameters including the manifold-to-riser pipe ratio, array geometry, manifold flow direction and flow rate influence the flow distribution and PV cell efficiency [288]. The authors included several design recommendations for improved performance. More recently, significant energy conversion efficiency improvements to both the electricity generation and heat collection efficiency were reported with water-based BIPV-T collectors [289]. The energy yields of integrated water-based BIPV-T collectors using different fa\u00e7ade orientations have been recently investigated [290], with results showing that the largest energy production is ach - ieved on the South fa\u00e7ade, while for maximum self-consumption it is recommended to split the BIPV-T collectors among the East, South and West fa\u00e7ades. Other investigators analysed and compared the techno-economic performance of uncovered water-based BIPV-T col - lectors: roof-integrated and/or fa\u00e7ade integrated vs . standalone PV-T collectors. They developed a model in TRNSYS and analysed the per - formance of the different integration alternatives for DHW, space heating and electricity provision in a multi-storey residential building located in different climates throughout Europe. The results showed simple payback times between 11 and 20 years depending on the climate, with lower payback times in Southern European cities [291]. Fig. 15 shows an application of dual air \u2013 water PV-T collectors in a built room, forming a BIPV-T system [292]. The PV-T collector was mounted on the south wall of the room, which can provide passive space heating on cold winter days and hot water during the warm seasons. The working mode can be easily switched between air-heating and water-heating modes in different seasons. On typical summer days, the thermal efficiency reached around 50% and the water tank temperature reached around 40 \u25e6 C for the water-heating mode. The PV-T collector was Fig. 14.

[147] proposed a refrigerant-based PV-T collector directly integrated into the roof, which acted as the electricity generator and evaporator of an HP. They developed a computer model to analyse the influence of different factors on the system efficiencies and concluded that electrical efficiency remains almost the same under the variation range of evaporation temperatures, while lower evapora - tion temperature leads to higher thermal (and system) efficiencies. 2.6. Concentrated PV-T collectors The difference between a concentrated PV-T (CPV-T) system and a CPV system with active cooling may be ambiguous. The authors take the view that the determination of whether any solar system that includes PV cells (whether concentrated or not) is or is not a PV-T system depends on whether the thermal energyrecovered from this system is utilized for a specific purpose, or rejected to the environment and/or the atmo - sphere. When the thermal energy is delivered as useful thermal output to an end-user in any application, either directly or indirectly via inter - mediate conversion, upgrading or storage, this can be considered a PV- T/CPV-T system, otherwise, it is a PV/CPV system with active (or pas - sive) cooling. CPV-T collectors increase the solar flux incident upon the solar cells, improving both the thermal and electrical outputs of the system, while at the same time the total PV area is reduced and replaced by low-cost reflectors; depending on the relative costs of these two components, this can lead to a reduction in the the system \u2019 s capital costs (and, thus, payback time) [35,71,73,76]. However, especially when sun tracking is needed, they are more expensive than flat-plate collectors, as this complex mechanism introduces additional costs. Consequently, these systems are normally used when medium to high temperatures are required (usually over 100 \u2013 150 \u25e6 C), while for lower temperature ap - plications flat-plate collectors appear as a better option [35,73]. CPV-T systems can use lenses or reflectors as concentrators, with lenses being more suitable due to their lower weight and material costs, although they cannot focus scattered light. Therefore, concentrators are normally limited to locations with clear sky weather. Generally, CPV-T systems use liquids (e.g., water, oil, molten salts) rather than air as a coolant because it is more effective, hence obtaining a higher electrical output [35,73]. There are different CPV-T collector types, ranging from stationary flat-plate collectors with added reflectors and low concentrating ratio (solar concentrating ratio < 2.5), to highly concentrating ratio units which require tracking, making roof integration difficult and signifi - cantly increasing maintenance costs [73,76]. Similarly, there are many types of solar tracking options and technologies, and a variety of tracker drive types, which have been reviewed in detail in previous work [293]. In general, CPV-T systems can be grouped into three broad cate - gories: (a) systems with concentration onto a single receiver, where both the PV and thermal receiver are a combined, single unit and under concentrated sunlight; (b) spectrum splitting systems, where the incoming irradiation is split into two components that are delivered to distinct PV and thermal receivers; and (c) systems wherein the PV receiver acts as both a spectral splitter and concentrator. These config - urations are shown schematically in Fig. 16. Fig. 16(a) will result in the highest operating temperature of the PV cells and active cooling is required. In this configuration, achieving high working fluid temperatures results in exceedingly high PV cell temper - atures, reducing cell efficiency. Fig. 16(b) reduces the PV cell working temperature by removing the incident spectrum that the PV cell cannot convert to electricity (or wavelengths of low conversion efficiency). This approach can potentially enable high PV cell efficiency and high thermal receiver working temperatures. Fig. 16(c) is a special case of (b) where the PV receiver acts as both a spectral filter and a concentrator. Such a configuration requires PV receivers with high reflectivity outside of wavelengths of absorption for the PV receiver and can also enable high thermal working temperatures. A significant challenge, however, arises in the comparison of such systems as the design with different levels of concentration, PV cell band-gap, and spectral splitting wavelengths (if used) all drastically impact performance. Additionally, this is further complicated by the design objective of the system, particularly con - cerning the desired operating temperature of the thermal receiver. The two primary metrics for assessing the performance are the overall effi - ciency and the fraction of energy collected from the thermal and PV receivers [294]. The biggest challenge in using the overall efficiency is in quantifying the relative values of the electrical and thermal energy outputs. While many approaches simply add the thermal efficiency to the PV efficiency, this oversimplifies the issue as higher temperatures may be required for a given thermal process. It is possible to assign weighting factors [295] to the thermal energy (although this is assumption driven) or to consider the conversion of all thermal energy to electrical energy (which may not be relevant for heat-driven needs). These metrics are useful for providing insights into the performance bounds of a variety of system configurations and are particularly useful for understanding the upper limits of efficiency, particularly with respect to the PV system [294,296]. Ultimately, this results in difficulty when comparing CPV-T systems, because differing operating tempera - tures, use cases, and designs can lead to significant variations in a defined efficiency. In stationary applications, when the PV-T collectors are installed in a horizontal plane, part of the incoming solar radiation is not used, as it is incident on the horizontal surface free of PV cells which is left to avoid shading. To avoid this effect, some studies [71,73] proposed the installation of booster diffuse reflectors placed between the parallel PV-T collector rows. These reflectors consist of an aluminium sheet and give a nearly uniform distribution of the reflected solar radiation on the PV surface, increasing the solar input by about 50% maximum, which means a concentration ratio of about 1.5 [71]. The results showed that with this configuration it is possible to increase the ele"}, {"file_name": "xaa.txt", "file_size": 50567, "file_type": "text/plain", "extracted_content": "Mar\u00eda Herrando a , b , Kai Wang c , Gan Huang b , d , Todd Otanicar e , Osama Bany Mousa f , Rafaela A.

We cover both experimental and computational studies, identify opportunities for performance enhancement, pathways for collector innovation, and implications of their wider deployment at the solar-generation system level. First, we classify and review the main types of PV-T collectors, including air-based, liquid-based, dual air \u2013 water, heat-pipe, building integrated and concentrated PV-T collectors. This is followed by a presentation of performance enhancement opportunities and pathways for collector innovation. Here, we address state-of-the-art design modifications, next-generation PV cell technologies, selective coatings, spectral splitting and nanofluids. Beyond this, we address wider PV-T systems and their applications, comprising a thorough review of solar combined heat and power (S \u2013 CHP), solar cooling, solar combined cooling, heat and power (S \u2013 CCHP), solar desalination, solar drying and solar for hydrogen production systems. This includes a specific review of potential performance and cost improvements and opportunities at the solar- generation system level in thermal energy storage, control and demand-side management. Subsequently, a set of the most promising PV-T systems is assessed to analyse their carbon mitigation potential and how this technology might fit within pathways for global decarbonization. It is estimated that the REmap baseline emission curve can be reduced by more than 16% in 2030 if the uptake of solar PV-T technologies can be promoted. Finally, the review turns to a critical examination of key challenges for the adoption of PV-T technology and recommendations. 1. Background and introduction 1.1. Context and motivation The interest in and demand for alternative energy from renewable sources has continued to rise globally in recent decades, promoted by an increase in environmental awareness and the growing importance placed on sustainability, reducing energy consumption and the associ - ated emissions and pollution. In 1992, the Rio Convention on Climate Change [1] established a framework for actions aimed at reducing fossil-fuel consumption and limiting the associated emissions. In 2015, over 190 countries signed a legally-binding agreement at the Paris Climate Conference [2] to keep the rise in the average global tempera - ture below 2 \u25e6 C (above 20th-century pre-industrial levels) [3]. To ach - ieve this challenging target, a fundamental transformation of the global energy system is required, which has in fact been taking place in recent decades [4]. Renewable energy systems have been the main drivers and will continue to be essential for this transformation as they contribute to all objectives: promoting the security of supply while lowering energy costs, reducing emissions while driving growth and generating jobs through industrial development. A record 200 GW of renewable energy capacity was added in 2019. Renewable energy accounted for 27% of global electricity use and over 18% of the world \u2019 s total energy con - sumption according to the latest REN21 report [5].

This growth has been made possible by the implementation of national policies that have supported renewable projects in Europe, and by the Chinese policy of subsidies for PV systems [5,7]. In 2019, the renewable energy sector employed 11.5 million people, among these 4.6 million were employed in the solar sector [8]. Solar energy is an abundant primary-energy resource, which can be exploited in cost-competitive and reliable ways for electrical power generation, either with PV technology or thermodynamic cycles in concentrated solar power (CSP) systems, as well as for heating or cooling purposes through ST systems. Some of the advantages of this renewable resource compared to others, e.g., wind, are its larger predictability on an annual basis and daily [9], the low degradation rate of the compo - nents of a solar installation during its lifetime which is generally 20 \u2013 25 years [10,11], and that this technology rarely underperforms or fails. For example, long-term field data show that PV panels experience, on average, a power output loss of only 0.5% per year [12], and only 2% of the PV panels installed do not meet the manufacturer \u2019 s warranty after 10 years [13]. The total worldwide power generation capacity of installed PV panels increased by 12% in 2019 and reached a record of 630 GW in total, while the thermal energy generation capacity of installed ST col - lectors amounted to 480 GW (thermal Watt) in 2019, with China ac - counting for almost 70% of the total solar thermal capacity [6,14], which corresponds to savings of about 140 million tons of CO 2 per year [6].

Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 3 countries in Europe have an installed capacity that covers above 8% of the total demand (Italy 9%, Greece 8% and Germany 8%) [5], as a result of the strong incentives for solar electricity adopted in the recent years. As a consequence of this growth, the cost of PV panels has been falling, reaching an average selling price of PV panels of 0.38 USD/W p (rated Watt peak) in 2019 [15,16], and it is becoming apparent that solar PV technologies will soon become one of the lowest-cost options for elec - tricity generation. This technology has the potential not only of providing on-grid power, displacing fossil fuel consumption, but also PV panels can provide electrification in remote rural areas, particularly in developing countries, where there is no or limited access to the elec - tricity grid. By the end of 2019, around 9.5 thousand mini-grids systems entirely or partly based on renewables were in operation together with small-scaled distributed standalone systems [17]. For instance, in China small-scale standalone PV systems substantially contributed to the progressive electrification of areas not yet interconnected to the main electricity grid [7]. The solar heat market represents a notable share of the global heating market, mainly in providing space heating (SH) and domestic hot water (DHW) [11]. Small-scale thermosiphon systems, which account for 60% of current ST systems, are facing market pressure from heat pumps (HPs) and PV systems. The global capacity of ST decreased by 6% in 2019 compared to 2018, driven by a market slowdown in China (new collector installations in China decreased by 8%) [6]. However, the number of large-scale (megawatt-scale) ST systems for industrial applications and district heating still keeps consistently growing in recent years. For example, the market of Denmark increased by 170% in 2019 owing to several newly installed large-scale solar thermal systems [6]. Compared to the PV market, the installation of ST systems in the EU has not expe - rienced the same growth. For example, approximately 50 GW of PV panels and 15 GW of ST collectors were installed in Germany by 2019 [18]. This trend is attributed to the lack of incentives, financial support, education and knowledge [11]. The experience gained from ST in - stallations in countries such as Cyprus, Greece and Austria, indicates the great potential of such systems for utilizing solar energy, and that this potential is still far from having been exploited. Therefore, there is potential for the development and wider use of solar systems as they can help in the transformation of the worldwide energy system [19]. However, further investment in existing as well as in future solar technologies is necessary to reduce the costs and make these systems cost-competitive, as well as to ensure appropriate infra - structure [20,21], along with increased public awareness and support. If solar generation should be deployed in a distributed nature, particularly in urban environments, then the amount of suitable space for solar installations will become increasingly scarce [22]. Therefore, to be competitive, the cost per unit of energy from solar technologies should be low and the energy generated per m 2 should be maximized. PV systems are widely used and there is a broad commercial offer available in the market. However, the limited conversion efficiency, the high PV cell temperature that can be reached, which damage the PV cells, and dust accumulation, are some of the barriers that hinder their potential. In an attempt to regulate the PV cell temperature, there has been important research in the last decades in the assessment of different cooling techniques [23]. This research gave rise to hybrid PV-thermal (PV-T) collectors, which generate both electricity and useful thermal energy from the same aperture area, and with overall (electrical + thermal) efficiencies that are much higher (reaching > 70%) than separate standalone systems. PV-T collectors can easily be integrated with other system compo - nents (energy conversion, energy storage, etc.) to provide both thermal and electrical energy outputs. For example, PV-T collectors can be easily integrated with economical hot water tanks for thermal storage, and with batteries for electricity storage. Thus, this technology appears as a particularly promising alternative, especially within a high-penetration scenario, and particularly in applications such as in the urban environ - ment, where there are both thermal and electrical energy demands and the efficient use of limited space is essential. PV-T collectors can also be integrated with other types of solar collectors (i.e., PV panels or ST collectors) to adjust the ratio of heating and electricity supply, to meet specific demands [24]. The relevance and potential of PV-T collectors and their integration with other components to obtain new solutions in HVAC systems were underpinned by Task 60 \u201c Application of PV-T Col - lectors and New Solutions in HVAC Systems \u201d , which run from 2018 to 2020, in the solar heating and cooling (SHC) Programme of the Inter - national Energy Agency (IEA) [25]. 1.2. Physical considerations of PV-T collectors The initial motivation for the development of PV-T technology was the possibility of using a heat transfer fluid to cool the PV cells in such collectors. However, the delivery of a thermal output at a useful (high enough) temperature [26] leads inevitably to a conflict in the design and operation of conventional PV-T collectors, as these can be operated at temperatures higher than those of PV panels in the same conditions. When the priority is electricity generation, the heat transfer circuit is kept at a low temperature to avoid an otherwise undesirable decrease in the electrical efficiency of the PV cells. This constraint limits the use of the thermal energy generated. Therefore, a trade-off is needed depending on the specific application and the environmental conditions [27]. This introduces challenges for the design and operation of PV-T collectors, and solutions to overcome this conflict have been proposed, e.g., through spectral splitting, amongst others, presented in Section 3. The two main types of solar PV cell technologies considered for use in PV-T collectors are either based on crystalline silicon wafers or thin-film semiconductor materials deposited onto a glass or metal foil [28]. For a PV-T collector, the first significant difference is the fact that a c-Si PV panel is composed of a mosaic of discrete cells made from wafers whereas a thin-film module is made by patterning a large area of the semiconductor film. Superficially thin-film photovoltaics appears to lend themselves to PV-T collectors since, in principle, the PV cell could be deposited directly upon a thermally conductive heat exchanger. However, since silicon solar cells are manufactured as standard units that can be used interchangeably in regular PV panels and PV-T col - lectors, it is presently easier and cheaper to laminate c-Si cells to a heat sink rather than develop a bespoke process for depositing and patterning thin-film materials. This point becomes apparent when we consider the fabrication steps involved with each technology. In the case of c-Si, the process starts with processes developed for microelectronics to fabricate silicon wafers which are then processed into solar cells and then assembled into modules, usually by connecting the cells in series-connected strings, illustrated in Fig. 1(a). For a thin-film module, the process starts with the deposition of material onto a substrate (glass, metal foil, or polymer) which is then patterned using a laser to produce small strips of the active area, shown in Fig. 1(b). The patterning is necessary since the current density arising from a typical PV material is of the order 300 A m 2 . The issue does not arise in silicon modules since the series-connected silicon cells naturally divide this large current density by a factor of ~30. The spectral breath of sunlight places firm boundaries around the efficiency of PV power conversion but many of the losses in a standard PV cell can be recovered as thermal energy in a PV-T system. To indicate how much thermal and electrical energy is available we develop a simple model to quantify the losses. Sunlight spans photon energies ranging from 0.4 to 4 eV and is plotted as a spectral flux b( E ) in Fig. 2(a). An ideal semiconductor absorber with a band-gap E g will selectively absorb sunlight with photon energies above that band-gap energy thereby promoting an electron from the valance band to the conduction band (Process 1 in Fig. 2 (b)) M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 4 while light below the band-gap energy will pass unabsorbed through the solar (Process 2 in Fig. 2(b)). For simplicity, in the example shown in Fig. 2(b) the excess photon energy ( E g ) is imparted to the excited elec - tron 1 that rapidly dissipates this energy through a thermalization pro - cess (Process 3 in Fig. 2(b)) to establish a thermal population of excited electrons. The occupation of electrons in the conduction band can be described by a quasi-Fermi level denoted by \u03bc c and a similar quasi-Fermi level denoted by \u03bc v for the holes. The separation of these quasi-Fermi levels results in the voltage ( V ) at the solar cell terminals which in turn drives current ( I ) through a load in the external circuit. Two limiting cases for the solar cell configuration are shown in Fig. 2 (c), in both cases the PV active photons are illustrated by the blue arrow while the pink arrow indicates sub-band-gap photons that are not absorbed by the semiconductor material. Most non-silicon solar cells correspond to Fig. 2(c \u2013 i) where the unabsorbed low-energy photons are reflected from the rear surface and leave the solar cell. Fig. 2(c-ii) shows a configuration where low-energy photons are absorbed by a separate thermal absorber. Uniquely silicon solar cells correspond to Fig. 2(c-ii) where the absorptivity of the solar cell is close to unity from UV through to the mid-IR hence completely extinguishing the solar [29,30]. Only the radiative recombination loss (Process 4 in Fig. 2(b)) is irrecoverable in a PV-T system. However, even in the radiative limit, it is a comparatively small fraction of the overall solar cell power-loss when operating at the maximum power-point [31]. Furthermore, in almost all solar cell semiconductor materials, parasitic non-radiative processes that operate in parallel to the radiative loss tend to be orders of magnitude larger, hence for a practical PV-T system recombination losses can be assumed to generate heat, rather than light. In the solar cell configuration shown in Fig. 2(c \u2013 i) the energy associated with the belo - w- E g loss (Process 2 in Fig. 2(b)) is lost from the solar cell however in the solar cell configuration shown in Fig. 2(c-ii), it results in the full ab - sorption of the solar flux. To illustrate the behaviour of two different solar cell types, we consider the limiting cases of silicon ( E g = 1.12 eV) and CdTe ( E g = 1.5eV) that correspond to the top-two solar cell terrestrial solar cell technologies manufactured by the capacity to date [32]. A simple model for the current ( I ) voltage ( V ) characteristic of a PV cell is: I ( V ) = J sc  E g )  J 01 ( e qV kT  1 ) (1.1) Fig. 1.

The electricity generation potential of the PV cells is typically the primary energy output of PV-T collectors. In the two examples here, the IV characteristics of silicon and CdTe cells are broadly determined by their band-gap energy. The lower band-gap of silicon provides a larger current but smaller voltage compared to CdTe. The optimum band-gap energy for electrical power conversion is approximately 1.3 eV, which is between the band-gaps of CdTe and silicon [31]. The electrical power delivered by the two cells is broadly similar but the maximum power point for the CdTe cell sits at a higher voltage than the silicon. All PV cell parameters are dependent upon temperature, hence the power that is delivered by a PV device is: P ( T ) = V oc ( T ) J sc ( T ) FF ( T ) (1.4) The temperature coefficient of power ( \u03b2 Pmax ) is composed of the sum of three different coefficients: \u03b2 Pmax = \u03b2 Voc + \u03b2 Jsc + \u03b2 FF (1.5) Of these temperature coefficients, the voltage coefficient ( \u03b2 Voc ) dominates the power loss with increasing temperature, owing to an in - crease in internal recombination rate with temperature. The tempera - ture coefficient is weakly positive since the thermal expansion of the semiconductor lattice leads to a reduction in the electronic band-gap and hence marginally higher absorbed photon flux. The fill factor ( FF ) also has a weak dependence on temperature. The temperature dependency of the fill factor depends largely on the cell voltage and any temperature dependency of series resistance R s : 1 FF d FF d T = ( 1  1 . 02 FF 0 ) ( 1 V oc d V oc d T  1 T )  R s V oc / I sc  R s ( 1 R s d R s d T ) (1.6) In turn, the temperature dependency of voltage depends on the band- gap energy, the V oc and an empirical parameter \u03b3 that accounts for the recombination mechanisms present in the solar cell [33]: d V oc d T =  E g q  V oc + \u03b3 kT q T (1.7) Overall, this gives a strong temperature coefficient dependency with band-gap energy ( E g ). Cells with low band-gaps, such as Ge have large, negative temperature coefficients power, with silicon and other con - ventional PV materials having correspondingly smaller temperature coefficients. Therefore, from the perspective of achieving the smallest temperature coefficient, it is desirable to use a high-band-gap semi - conductor. Since a high band-gap will leave many photons unabsorbed, these could be used in a thermal collector. It is also worth noting that in Eq. (1.6), the V oc itself also affects the temperature coefficient. From a wider PV-T perspective, however, the thermal generation potential of these collectors when using different solar cell technologies will also be of interest and this can be substantially different (refer back to Fig. 3(c) for the two cell types considered above). Under short-circuit and open-circuit, no electrical power is delivered, but since the silicon solar cell absorbs the full solar spectrum, the thermal generation equates to the incident solar energy. The CdTe device only absorbs light above the band-gap energy, giving substantially lower thermal generation. At the maximum power point, the thermal generation reaches a minimum, yet the silicon cell still delivers 750 W/m 2 at maximum power, while the CdTe cell only reaches 400 W/m 2 . We will return to the current elec - trical and thermal performance of different PV-T collectors in Section 2 and the potential for improvement in Section 3. 1.3. Previous reviews Almost all previous review papers on PV-T technology focussed on this technology at the collector level, reviewing various design and geometrical configurations based on different thermal management concepts. Older reviews focussed on air- or liquid-based PV-T collectors [34 \u2013 36], while more recent ones also include concentrated PV-T (CPV-T) collectors [37], heat-pipe PV-T collectors [23,38 \u2013 40], phase-change material (PCM)-based PV-T collectors [23,28,38 \u2013 41], dual air \u2013 water PV-T and PV-T collectors with nanofluids [38,39,42,43]. Some of them review alternative structural designs [23,35,42,44], while others analyse the PV-T layers [44], and parameters that affect the performance of flat-plate PV-T collectors [45]. Other reviews analysed previous studies that discussed the design and cooling considerations aimed at improved collector performance [46], or reviewed studies that included environmental issues about PV-T systems [40] and analysed factors that affect PV-T collectors from an environmental point of view [47]. Others also include a review of the progress on practical PV-T applications [28,37,41], analysing the limitations and advantages of PV-T collectors [28]. Meanwhile, other reviews specifically focussed on liquid-based PV-T collectors [48], reviewing previous experimental and simulation studies of refrigerant-based and water-based PV-T collectors. There are several reviews of solar cooling systems, mostly focussed Fig. 3. Characteristic performance of solar cells made from silicon solar cell (solid line) and CdTe solar cell (dashed line) showing: (a) the IV characteristics; (b) electrical power; and (c) thermal generation.

Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 6 on the integration of ST collectors, including flat-plate collectors (FPCs), evacuated-tube collectors (ETCs) and parabolic-trough collectors (PTCs), with thermally-driven cooling technologies, including ab/ adsorption [49 \u2013 59], desiccant [53 \u2013 56,59], ejector/Rankine [54,55,59, 60] or Stirling [59] systems. Some reviews also address PV panels in - tegrated with HPs [49,51,53,55,59], Stirling or thermoelectric [59] systems, while a previous review of solar systems integrated with ab - sorption HPs [57] includes a section on PV-T systems, but as a separate system from the HP (see Table 1). Two recent reviews on solar heating and cooling (SHC) technologies report several alternatives for solar heating or cooling, without addressing combined heating and cooling technologies. One review focusses on solar thermal based on FPC/ETC or solar air collectors, or alternatively PV panels; air-based PV-T and water-based PV-T systems are briefly discussed as solar heating systems [61]. The second review covers solar thermal and electrical systems, electrical and thermal storage options, heat pumps and solar cooling alternatives, without specifically addressing PV-T collectors, but mentioning previous PV-T studies [62]. We have found very few review papers that specifically address PV-T collectors and wider systems for heating and/or cooling applications [63 \u2013 65] (see Table 1). Amongst these, Guo et al. [63] focusses on PV-T fa\u00e7ade and solar thermal (air/water) desiccant systems for cooling and dehumidification, while Alobaid et al. [64] review current de - velopments of PV-T collectors integrated with absorption cooling sys - tems. A recent paper [69] briefly reviews SHC systems by absorption and adsorption systems driven by solar thermal (FPC/ETC/PFC) or PV-T/CPV-T collectors, focussing on the modelling and simulation of polygeneration systems based con PV-T/CPV-T collectors for the pro - vision of cooling, heating and power to buildings. Other studies review the integration of ST and PV-T collectors with solar assisted heat pumps (SAHP) for heating purposes [65 \u2013 68], (a) analysing and comparing previous studies of PV, ST or PV-T collectors integrated air-source HPs [66], (b) reviewing mathematical models for SAHP systems and per - formance enhancements [67], or (c) specifically focussing on reviewing the performance, component details and of research progress of PV-T-SAHP systems [68,70]. However, none of the above [65 \u2013 68] is specifically focussed on PV-T collectors, and none of them addresses other applications such as solar cooling, desalination, drying or hydrogen production. 1.4. Aim and contribution This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of- the-art in PV-T collectors and of the wider solar-energy systems within which they can be implemented, and also to assess the local (at the end- user/building level) and worldwide energy and carbon mitigation po - tential of such systems. In this review, we cover experimental and computational studies, identify performance enhancement opportunities and innovation path - ways and, also, the implications of widespread deployment at the solar- generation system level. Specifically, we first proceed to classify and review the main types of PV-T collectors, including air-based, liquid- based, dual air \u2013 water, heat-pipe, building-integrated and CPV-T col - lectors (Section 2). This is followed by a presentation of techno- economic performance enhancement opportunities and pathways for collector innovation (Section 3). Here, we address state-of-the-art design modifications, next-generation PV cell technologies, selective coatings, spectral splitting and nanofluids. Beyond this, we include content with a particular focus on wider PV-T-based systems and their applications (Section 4), comprising a thorough review of solar combined heat and power (S \u2013 CHP), solar cooling, solar combined cooling, heat and power (S \u2013 CCHP), solar desalination, solar drying systems, and solar for hydrogen production. This includes a specific review of potential per - formance and cost improvements and opportunities at the solar- generation system level in thermal energy storage, component integra - tion, control and demand-side management (DSM) (Section 5). Throughout the paper, we review research lines extending, importantly, to research gaps and opportunities to promote the technology readiness levels (TRLs) of important related elements of wider PV-T-based systems. Subsequently, a set of the most promising PV-T systems is assessed in a series of decarbonization scenarios to analyse the carbon mitigation potential of PV-T systems and how this technology could fit in various pathways for global decarbonization (Section 6). Finally, the review will turn to a critical examination of the future of PV-T tech - nology and systems, including challenges, recommendations and main conclusions (Section 7). 2. Solar PV-T collectors Most of the solar radiation absorbed by a PV cell is converted to heat (in fact, internal energy), increasing the temperature of the cell and decreasing its electrical efficiency [35,71 \u2013 73]. To overcome this, solar cells can be cooled by a suitable fluid (gas or liquid) flow, decreasing their temperature and improving their efficiency, while producing a useful thermal output. The synergistic combination of the improved electrical output and the associated heat provision potential has moti - vated the development of hybrid PV-T collectors [35,71 \u2013 73], which have emerged as holistic solar energy solutions that combine PV cells for electricity generation, coupled with a thermal absorber containing a heat transfer fluid for heat provision from the same collector [71, 74 \u2013 77]. PV-T collectors enable the generation and use of electricity onsite, so-called self-consumption, which is acknowledged as the cheapest way to generate energy with renewables while reducing the stress on the local grid [4,78]. PV-T collectors can be integrated with other technol - ogies such as HPs or cooling systems [64,79], can be used for solar desalination [80,81], solar drying [82,83], or hydrogen production [84, 85], and the excess electricity generated can be stored to be used later on [86 \u2013 90]. Moreover, careful planning of the energy use via DSM is of key importance in the effective operation of the system [86,87], as detailed in Section 5.3. There are several classifications of hybrid PV-T collectors depending on different factors: (a) the collector cover(s); (b) the type of PV Table 1 Summary of previous reviews. Ref.

There are different methods to cool the PV panel, and the optimum solution strongly depends on several factors such as the PV technology used, the concentration ratio (if any) and the weather conditions where the system is installed [23]. The two main cooling mechanisms are passive and active cooling. The former refers to technologies that minimize or extract the heat absorbed by the PV panel without addi - tional power consumption. There are different options such as the integration on the rear PV panel surface of fins or other extruded sur - faces made of high thermal conductivity metals such as aluminium or copper, to enhance heat transfer to the ambient; the use of PCMs or the use of heat pipes that efficiently transfer the heat through a boiling-condensing process. The main constraint of these alternatives is that the heat dissipation is limited by the contact area between the heat sink and the ambient [23,41]. Alternatively, active cooling systems extract the heat using different cooling fluids driven by fans in case of air or a pump when liquids are used. The cooling medium can be in the liquid or gaseous phase. The most common liquid used in flat-plate PV-T collectors is water or a mixture of water and glycol to avoid freezing. Meanwhile, air-based PV- T collectors provide a simpler solution to cool solar PV cells. For each of these types of PV-T systems, there are several designs of the thermal absorber, as shown in the following sections. The potential of PV-T systems has been confirmed with simulations in reliable computational environments such as ANSYS Fluent, COM - SOL, MATLAB, Modelica, Polysun, TRANSOL, and TRNSYS. However, despite their demonstrated potential, only a modest number of manu - facturers are producing PV-T collectors and the market remains small [91,92]. A market survey was undertaken under Task 60 of the Inter - national Energy Agengy (IEA), with 26 collector manufacturers and suppliers from 11 countries identified. The survey showed that most of the manufacturers focus on liquid-based PV-T collectors (48% uncov - ered PV-T collectors, 28% covered PV-T collectors, 4% vacuum tube PV-T collectors), while 12% manufacture air-based PV-T collectors and 8% CPV-T collectors [92]. Fig. 4 shows the performance of commercially available PV-T col - lectors, in terms of both thermal and electrical outputs. Note that the CPV-T options shown are low-concentrating ratios, without tracking. It should be highlighted that a specific norm for testing PV-T collectors is not available currently, so the thermal and electrical outputs are often stated at different conditions, and thus comparisons among different products are not straightforward. The thermal performance of PV-T collectors can be tested according to the standard ISO 9806:2017, but this has several limitations, as it is intended for ST collectors, so the electrical output is not considered. For the PV panel output, there is a standard procedure, following the methodology of the IEC 60904, and usually, this output is provided by the PV panel manufacturer. However, if PV cell performance is not characterized before its integration into a PV-T collector, it should be characterized accordingly when character - izing the PV-T collector, separately from the thermal performance characterization [93]. Fig. 5 shows a map of the same commercially available PV-T col - lectors in terms of the market price (as of 2020 when this data was collected) vs . their estimated thermal and electrical outputs. It is observed that, in general, water-based PV-T collectors have larger out - puts (W/m 2 ) at a lower price ( \u20ac /m 2 ). By the end of 2019, a total PV-T collector area of 1,160,000 m 2 was installed, with a total thermal capacity of around 530 MW and a peak PV power of around 180 MW. In the European market, France is the market leader with an installed collector area of approximately 484,000 m 2 , followed by Germany with around 112,000 m 2 . Outside of Europe, Korea is the market leader with an installed area of ~280,000 m 2 , fol - lowed by China with ~133,000 m 2 [6]. From the total installed thermal capacity, 57% corresponds to uncovered water-based PV-T collectors, 41% to air-based PV-T collectors and the remaining 2% to covered water-based PV-T collectors, while vacuum tube PV-T collectors and CPV-T collectors play only a minor role [92].

M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 8 2.1. Air-based PV-T collectors In air-based PV-T collectors, air is selected as the working (or, heat transfer) fluid, and acts to regulate the temperature of the PV cells. The main applications of this type of collector are for ventilation and space heating, or air-preheating purposes, integrated into roofs and building fa\u00e7ades [23,73], or installed as independent components on roofs [34], where the generated hot air can be used for drying, space heating or ventilation. There are two main types of air-based PV-T collectors, namely flat- plate and CPV-T collectors. Flat-plate collectors are considered the most common and simple design [94]. Air-based PV-T collectors typi - cally have a lower capital cost than liquid-based equivalents and are suitable for building applications in medium- and high-latitude regions. In low-latitude regions, the ambient air temperature during the day is high for almost half of the year, therefore limiting the application of air-based PV-T systems to a shorter period in terms of effective elec - tricity production. There are different configurations according to several factors. First, these systems can be classified depending on how the air flows through the system. Natural circulation is simpler and has lower costs than forced circulation, while the latter is more efficient. However, the en - ergy necessary to drive fans decreases the net electricity gain of the system in forced circulation systems [71]. While liquid-based PV-T collectors need a restricted passage to allow the liquid flow near the PV cells \u2019 back surface (usually a pipe or conduit), the air is allowed to flow both at the back and over the front surfaces of PV cells in air-based PV-T collectors. This can be done with mechanical power, i.e., a fan, or the flow can be naturally driven by buoyancy forces. When air is flowing over the front surface of cells, an extra glazing layer is required to form a passage between the cells and the environment. Although this is bene - ficial from a thermal performance perspective, it is less effective con - cerning electrical performance, as it increases the operating PV cell temperature for the same conditions, and imposes an additional reflec - tion loss to the incoming solar radiation. According to Chow [35], we can discriminate between four main collector types, depending on the air channel configuration, with PV-T collectors having: a channel above the PV cells, a channel below the PV cells, the PV cells between single-pass channels, and double-glass designs (see Fig. 6). The most noticeable difference is the duct that brings the cold (ambient or recirculated) air towards the collector, usually at the bottom of the collector, and the duct that removes the hot air usually from the top of the collector. Sometimes recirculation is used, i.e., the air flows first over the PV cell \u2019 s top surfaces and then directed underneath them before exiting the collector (Design (d) in Fig. 6). In this case, the inlet and outlet ducts are at the same end of the collector, usually the bottom one, reducing the height of the collector but also causing shading between subsequent rows. Different conclusions have been drawn, for example, some studies conclude that double-pass designs (Design (d) in Fig. 6) outperform single- pass designs, while others conclude that Design (c) is the least consuming in terms of fan power [35]. Other investigators considered double-glass PV-T collectors [41], or the addition of a suspended metal sheet in the middle of the air channel to improve thermal performance [23]. In the comprehensive review of air-based PV-T systems with and without thermal storage by Tyagi et al. [95], it was concluded that air-based PV-T systems are particularly well-suited to crop drying and electricity production. Additionally, the application of PCMs for thermal storage in PV-T systems was mentioned. Another review presented a broad classification of PV-T systems, an extensive list of important aspects of these systems together with sug - gestions for future work needed on the subject [96]. It was stated that air-based PV-T systems are most suitable for space heating applications in cold regions, since the ambient air temperature during the day is low most of the year, therefore eliminating the loss of effective electricity production while taking advantage of the collected heat from the PV-T collector for space heating. The status and future perspectives of PV-T systems, in particular air- based PV-T systems, have also been reviewed [39,43]. According to Al-Waeli et al. [39], air-based PV-T collectors have general overall ef - ficiencies (electrical plus thermal) ranging from 30% to 60%. Of this total efficiency, the electrical component associated with crystalline silicon PV cells is typically in the range of 15 \u2013 20% at typical operating temperatures. A review with attention to different solar cell technologies and recent techniques to improve such systems concluded that PV cells integrated with ST systems are self-sustained and more economical in rural areas [97]. A review focussing on the design of PV-T systems [46] highlighted the importance of nanofluids and nano-PCMs as alternatives or complementary to traditional cooling and storage solutions. From this analysis, it was concluded that cooling both sides of PV cells, with the employment of op - tical filtration using nanofluids, can result in significant improvements to the performance of a PV-T system. In addition, optimization of the cross-section of cooling channels and the use of honeycombs and nano-PCMs for storage and cooling purposes can provide better distribution of the thermal load. Guidelines for the appropriate selection of the channel depth, air flow rate and air distribution duct diameter optimization in PV-T collectors have also been studied [98]. An extensive study of the air cooling design and performance in a commercial air-based PV-T collector by natural flow is reported in Ref. [99], which suggests optimal configurations for PV-T solar systems. Other authors [100] investigated air-based PV-T collectors through modelling at steady-state conditions, to determine their thermal char - acteristics. \u00a8 Ozakin and Kaya [101] studied an air-cooled channel in an air-based PV-T collector to consider the effects of fins added to the channel and to estimate the exergetic performance of the collector. A similar study [102] presented a combined theoretical and experimental investigation of such collectors. A glazed collector was also tested experimentally by Agrawal and Tiwari [103,104], who estimated a payback period for the system of 1.8 years and 16.5 tons of CO 2 emission avoidance. The performance of four different air-based PV-T collector configu - rations with single-pass, double-pass and with glazing was studied by Slimani et al. [105], who concluded that the double-pass collector per - forms better in terms of overall daily energy generation. According to Hussain et al. [106], further work on efficiency improvements, cost Fig. 6. Longitudinal cross-section of common air-based PV-T collector designs. Figure reproduced from Chow [35] with permission from Elsevier (Copyright 2009 Elsevier). M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 9 reductions and building integration of air-based PV-T collectors are necessary for good performance to be attained. Several researchers have paid attention to various air-channel con - figurations. A theoretical analysis of air-based PV-T collectors [107] concluded that a glass cover improves the thermal efficiency of the sys - tem but reduces the electrical efficiency, in line with other similar work in the literature. It was additionally concluded that the solar radiation in - tensity, flow rate and channel depth are important parameters that in - fluence the system performance. Another study focussing on the channel configuration with additional fins and metal sheets in the flow channel [99] concluded that the addition of fins and metal sheets in the channel can improve the system performance. Metal sheets in the channel were also investigated by Shahsavar and Ameri [108] (see Table 2). A transpired collector with a transparent channel for air circulation was tested by Gholampour and Ameri [109]. Experimental validation of a model was performed with CFD modelling in Fluent, obtaining thermal system efficiencies of 45 \u2013 55%. Other studies have used modelling to investigate the performance of air PV-T systems [100,113,117], or a combination of theoretical analyses, modelling and experimental in - vestigations [113,114]. A summary of the different air-based PV-T collectors is provided in Table 2, addressing previous research on PV-T collectors with and without glazing, different arrangements of air channels, forced circula - tion by fans, adding fins in the air channel and size of the air channel. It can be concluded that double-pass PV-T collectors outperform single- pass designs, that glazed PV-T collectors have higher overall effi - ciencies than unglazed collectors, and that the use of metal sheets and fins in the air channel increases the thermal efficiency. The most common air-based PV-T configurations have a high TRL of 9 (actual system proven in operational environment), with several manufacturers on the market, such as GSE and Sunovate, as detailed in the market survey undertaken under Task 60 of the IEA [25,92]. Ac - cording to this survey, the French market is dominant, where almost all of the manufactured PV-T collectors are air-based PV-T collectors [92]. 2.2.

We cover both experimental and computational studies, identify opportunities for performance enhancement, pathways for collector innovation, and implications of their wider deployment at the solar-generation system level. First, we classify and review the main types of PV-T collectors, including air-based, liquid-based, dual air \u2013 water, heat-pipe, building integrated and concentrated PV-T collectors. This is followed by a presentation of performance enhancement opportunities and pathways for collector innovation. Here, we address state-of-the-art design modifications, next-generation PV cell technologies, selective coatings, spectral splitting and nanofluids. Beyond this, we address wider PV-T systems and their applications, comprising a thorough review of solar combined heat and power (S \u2013 CHP), solar cooling, solar combined cooling, heat and power (S \u2013 CCHP), solar desalination, solar drying and solar for hydrogen production systems. This includes a specific review of potential performance and cost improvements and opportunities at the solar- generation system level in thermal energy storage, control and demand-side management. Subsequently, a set of the most promising PV-T systems is assessed to analyse their carbon mitigation potential and how this technology might fit within pathways for global decarbonization. It is estimated that the REmap baseline emission curve can be reduced by more than 16% in 2030 if the uptake of solar PV-T technologies can be promoted. Finally, the review turns to a critical examination of key challenges for the adoption of PV-T technology and recommendations. 1. Background and introduction 1.1. Context and motivation The interest in and demand for alternative energy from renewable sources has continued to rise globally in recent decades, promoted by an increase in environmental awareness and the growing importance placed on sustainability, reducing energy consumption and the associ - ated emissions and pollution. In 1992, the Rio Convention on Climate Change [1] established a framework for actions aimed at reducing fossil-fuel consumption and limiting the associated emissions. In 2015, over 190 countries signed a legally-binding agreement at the Paris Climate Conference [2] to keep the rise in the average global tempera - ture below 2 \u25e6 C (above 20th-century pre-industrial levels) [3]. To ach - ieve this challenging target, a fundamental transformation of the global energy system is required, which has in fact been taking place in recent decades [4]. Renewable energy systems have been the main drivers and will continue to be essential for this transformation as they contribute to all objectives: promoting the security of supply while lowering energy costs, reducing emissions while driving growth and generating jobs through industrial development. A record 200 GW of renewable energy capacity was added in 2019. Renewable energy accounted for 27% of global electricity use and over 18% of the world \u2019 s total energy con - sumption according to the latest REN21 report [5].

This growth has been made possible by the implementation of national policies that have supported renewable projects in Europe, and by the Chinese policy of subsidies for PV systems [5,7]. In 2019, the renewable energy sector employed 11.5 million people, among these 4.6 million were employed in the solar sector [8]. Solar energy is an abundant primary-energy resource, which can be exploited in cost-competitive and reliable ways for electrical power generation, either with PV technology or thermodynamic cycles in concentrated solar power (CSP) systems, as well as for heating or cooling purposes through ST systems. Some of the advantages of this renewable resource compared to others, e.g., wind, are its larger predictability on an annual basis and daily [9], the low degradation rate of the compo - nents of a solar installation during its lifetime which is generally 20 \u2013 25 years [10,11], and that this technology rarely underperforms or fails. For example, long-term field data show that PV panels experience, on average, a power output loss of only 0.5% per year [12], and only 2% of the PV panels installed do not meet the manufacturer \u2019 s warranty after 10 years [13]. The total worldwide power generation capacity of installed PV panels increased by 12% in 2019 and reached a record of 630 GW in total, while the thermal energy generation capacity of installed ST col - lectors amounted to 480 GW (thermal Watt) in 2019, with China ac - counting for almost 70% of the total solar thermal capacity [6,14], which corresponds to savings of about 140 million tons of CO 2 per year [6].

Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 3 countries in Europe have an installed capacity that covers above 8% of the total demand (Italy 9%, Greece 8% and Germany 8%) [5], as a result of the strong incentives for solar electricity adopted in the recent years. As a consequence of this growth, the cost of PV panels has been falling, reaching an average selling price of PV panels of 0.38 USD/W p (rated Watt peak) in 2019 [15,16], and it is becoming apparent that solar PV technologies will soon become one of the lowest-cost options for elec - tricity generation. This technology has the potential not only of providing on-grid power, displacing fossil fuel consumption, but also PV panels can provide electrification in remote rural areas, particularly in developing countries, where there is no or limited access to the elec - tricity grid. By the end of 2019, around 9.5 thousand mini-grids systems entirely or partly based on renewables were in operation together with small-scaled distributed standalone systems [17]. For instance, in China small-scale standalone PV systems substantially contributed to the progressive electrification of areas not yet interconnected to the main electricity grid [7]. The solar heat market represents a notable share of the global heating market, mainly in providing space heating (SH) and domestic hot water (DHW) [11]. Small-scale thermosiphon systems, which account for 60% of current ST systems, are facing market pressure from heat pumps (HPs) and PV systems. The global capacity of ST decreased by 6% in 2019 compared to 2018, driven by a market slowdown in China (new collector installations in China decreased by 8%) [6]. However, the number of large-scale (megawatt-scale) ST systems for industrial applications and district heating still keeps consistently growing in recent years. For example, the market of Denmark increased by 170% in 2019 owing to several newly installed large-scale solar thermal systems [6]. Compared to the PV market, the installation of ST systems in the EU has not expe - rienced the same growth. For example, approximately 50 GW of PV panels and 15 GW of ST collectors were installed in Germany by 2019 [18]. This trend is attributed to the lack of incentives, financial support, education and knowledge [11]. The experience gained from ST in - stallations in countries such as Cyprus, Greece and Austria, indicates the great potential of such systems for utilizing solar energy, and that this potential is still far from having been exploited. Therefore, there is potential for the development and wider use of solar systems as they can help in the transformation of the worldwide energy system [19]. However, further investment in existing as well as in future solar technologies is necessary to reduce the costs and make these systems cost-competitive, as well as to ensure appropriate infra - structure [20,21], along with increased public awareness and support. If solar generation should be deployed in a distributed nature, particularly in urban environments, then the amount of suitable space for solar installations will become increasingly scarce [22]. Therefore, to be competitive, the cost per unit of energy from solar technologies should be low and the energy generated per m 2 should be maximized. PV systems are widely used and there is a broad commercial offer available in the market. However, the limited conversion efficiency, the high PV cell temperature that can be reached, which damage the PV cells, and dust accumulation, are some of the barriers that hinder their potential. In an attempt to regulate the PV cell temperature, there has been important research in the last decades in the assessment of different cooling techniques [23]. This research gave rise to hybrid PV-thermal (PV-T) collectors, which generate both electricity and useful thermal energy from the same aperture area, and with overall (electrical + thermal) efficiencies that are much higher (reaching > 70%) than separate standalone systems. PV-T collectors can easily be integrated with other system compo - nents (energy conversion, energy storage, etc.) to provide both thermal and electrical energy outputs. For example, PV-T collectors can be easily integrated with economical hot water tanks for thermal storage, and with batteries for electricity storage. Thus, this technology appears as a particularly promising alternative, especially within a high-penetration scenario, and particularly in applications such as in the urban environ - ment, where there are both thermal and electrical energy demands and the efficient use of limited space is essential. PV-T collectors can also be integrated with other types of solar collectors (i.e., PV panels or ST collectors) to adjust the ratio of heating and electricity supply, to meet specific demands [24]. The relevance and potential of PV-T collectors and their integration with other components to obtain new solutions in HVAC systems were underpinned by Task 60 \u201c Application of PV-T Col - lectors and New Solutions in HVAC Systems \u201d , which run from 2018 to 2020, in the solar heating and cooling (SHC) Programme of the Inter - national Energy Agency (IEA) [25]. 1.2. Physical considerations of PV-T collectors The initial motivation for the development of PV-T technology was the possibility of using a heat transfer fluid to cool the PV cells in such collectors. However, the delivery of a thermal output at a useful (high enough) temperature [26] leads inevitably to a conflict in the design and operation of conventional PV-T collectors, as these can be operated at temperatures higher than those of PV panels in the same conditions. When the priority is electricity generation, the heat transfer circuit is kept at a low temperature to avoid an otherwise undesirable decrease in the electrical efficiency of the PV cells. This constraint limits the use of the thermal energy generated. Therefore, a trade-off is needed depending on the specific application and the environmental conditions [27]. This introduces challenges for the design and operation of PV-T collectors, and solutions to overcome this conflict have been proposed, e.g., through spectral splitting, amongst others, presented in Section 3. The two main types of solar PV cell technologies considered for use in PV-T collectors are either based on crystalline silicon wafers or thin-film semiconductor materials deposited onto a glass or metal foil [28]. For a PV-T collector, the first significant difference is the fact that a c-Si PV panel is composed of a mosaic of discrete cells made from wafers whereas a thin-film module is made by patterning a large area of the semiconductor film. Superficially thin-film photovoltaics appears to lend themselves to PV-T collectors since, in principle, the PV cell could be deposited directly upon a thermally conductive heat exchanger. However, since silicon solar cells are manufactured as standard units that can be used interchangeably in regular PV panels and PV-T col - lectors, it is presently easier and cheaper to laminate c-Si cells to a heat sink rather than develop a bespoke process for depositing and patterning thin-film materials. This point becomes apparent when we consider the fabrication steps involved with each technology. In the case of c-Si, the process starts with processes developed for microelectronics to fabricate silicon wafers which are then processed into solar cells and then assembled into modules, usually by connecting the cells in series-connected strings, illustrated in Fig. 1(a). For a thin-film module, the process starts with the deposition of material onto a substrate (glass, metal foil, or polymer) which is then patterned using a laser to produce small strips of the active area, shown in Fig. 1(b). The patterning is necessary since the current density arising from a typical PV material is of the order 300 A m 2 . The issue does not arise in silicon modules since the series-connected silicon cells naturally divide this large current density by a factor of ~30. The spectral breath of sunlight places firm boundaries around the efficiency of PV power conversion but many of the losses in a standard PV cell can be recovered as thermal energy in a PV-T system. To indicate how much thermal and electrical energy is available we develop a simple model to quantify the losses. Sunlight spans photon energies ranging from 0.4 to 4 eV and is plotted as a spectral flux b( E ) in Fig. 2(a). An ideal semiconductor absorber with a band-gap E g will selectively absorb sunlight with photon energies above that band-gap energy thereby promoting an electron from the valance band to the conduction band (Process 1 in Fig. 2 (b)) M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 4 while light below the band-gap energy will pass unabsorbed through the solar (Process 2 in Fig. 2(b)). For simplicity, in the example shown in Fig. 2(b) the excess photon energy ( E g ) is imparted to the excited elec - tron 1 that rapidly dissipates this energy through a thermalization pro - cess (Process 3 in Fig. 2(b)) to establish a thermal population of excited electrons. The occupation of electrons in the conduction band can be described by a quasi-Fermi level denoted by \u03bc c and a similar quasi-Fermi level denoted by \u03bc v for the holes. The separation of these quasi-Fermi levels results in the voltage ( V ) at the solar cell terminals which in turn drives current ( I ) through a load in the external circuit. Two limiting cases for the solar cell configuration are shown in Fig. 2 (c), in both cases the PV active photons are illustrated by the blue arrow while the pink arrow indicates sub-band-gap photons that are not absorbed by the semiconductor material. Most non-silicon solar cells correspond to Fig. 2(c \u2013 i) where the unabsorbed low-energy photons are reflected from the rear surface and leave the solar cell. Fig. 2(c-ii) shows a configuration where low-energy photons are absorbed by a separate thermal absorber. Uniquely silicon solar cells correspond to Fig. 2(c-ii) where the absorptivity of the solar cell is close to unity from UV through to the mid-IR hence completely extinguishing the solar [29,30]. Only the radiative recombination loss (Process 4 in Fig. 2(b)) is irrecoverable in a PV-T system. However, even in the radiative limit, it is a comparatively small fraction of the overall solar cell power-loss when operating at the maximum power-point [31]. Furthermore, in almost all solar cell semiconductor materials, parasitic non-radiative processes that operate in parallel to the radiative loss tend to be orders of magnitude larger, hence for a practical PV-T system recombination losses can be assumed to generate heat, rather than light. In the solar cell configuration shown in Fig. 2(c \u2013 i) the energy associated with the belo - w- E g loss (Process 2 in Fig. 2(b)) is lost from the solar cell however in the solar cell configuration shown in Fig. 2(c-ii), it results in the full ab - sorption of the solar flux. To illustrate the behaviour of two different solar cell types, we consider the limiting cases of silicon ( E g = 1.12 eV) and CdTe ( E g = 1.5eV) that correspond to the top-two solar cell terrestrial solar cell technologies manufactured by the capacity to date [32]. A simple model for the current ( I ) voltage ( V ) characteristic of a PV cell is: I ( V ) = J sc  E g )  J 01 ( e qV kT  1 ) (1.1) Fig. 1.

M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 5 where J sc is the cell short-circuit current density, J 01 is the diode satu - ration current density, q is the electronic charge and k is Boltzmann \u2019 s constant. Assuming full absorption to the band-gap energy E g and in the absence of reflectivity losses, the upper limit to the solar cell short- circuit current is given by: J sc  E g ) = q \u222b \u221e E g b ( E ) d E (1.2) The thermal generation in a PV cell can be approximated by: Q ( V ) = \u222b \u221e E th E b ( E ) d E  V I ( V ) (1.3) where E th is the threshold for the onset of absorption in the PV-T collector. Taking illustrative examples of a CdTe solar cell ( E th = E g = 1.5 eV, J 01 = 5.54 \u00d7 10  13 A m  2 ) and silicon solar cell ( E th = 0 eV, E g = 1.1 eV, J 01 = 7.64 \u00d7 10  10 A m  2 ), the current \u2013 voltage characteristics, elec - trical power and thermal generation are plotted in Fig. 3. The electricity generation potential of the PV cells is typically the primary energy output of PV-T collectors. In the two examples here, the IV characteristics of silicon and CdTe cells are broadly determined by their band-gap energy. The lower band-gap of silicon provides a larger current but smaller voltage compared to CdTe. The optimum band-gap energy for electrical power conversion is approximately 1.3 eV, which is between the band-gaps of CdTe and silicon [31]. The electrical power delivered by the two cells is broadly similar but the maximum power point for the CdTe cell sits at a higher voltage than the silicon. All PV cell parameters are dependent upon temperature, hence the power that is delivered by a PV device is: P ( T ) = V oc ( T ) J sc ( T ) FF ( T ) (1.4) The temperature coefficient of power ( \u03b2 Pmax ) is composed of the sum of three different coefficients: \u03b2 Pmax = \u03b2 Voc + \u03b2 Jsc + \u03b2 FF (1.5) Of these temperature coefficients, the voltage coefficient ( \u03b2 Voc ) dominates the power loss with increasing temperature, owing to an in - crease in internal recombination rate with temperature. The tempera - ture coefficient is weakly positive since the thermal expansion of the semiconductor lattice leads to a reduction in the electronic band-gap and hence marginally higher absorbed photon flux. The fill factor ( FF ) also has a weak dependence on temperature. The temperature dependency of the fill factor depends largely on the cell voltage and any temperature dependency of series resistance R s : 1 FF d FF d T = ( 1  1 . 02 FF 0 ) ( 1 V oc d V oc d T  1 T )  R s V oc / I sc  R s ( 1 R s d R s d T ) (1.6) In turn, the temperature dependency of voltage depends on the band- gap energy, the V oc and an empirical parameter \u03b3 that accounts for the recombination mechanisms present in the solar cell [33]: d V oc d T =  E g q  V oc + \u03b3 kT q T (1.7) Overall, this gives a strong temperature coefficient dependency with band-gap energy ( E g ). Cells with low band-gaps, such as Ge have large, negative temperature coefficients power, with silicon and other con - ventional PV materials having correspondingly smaller temperature coefficients. Therefore, from the perspective of achieving the smallest temperature coefficient, it is desirable to use a high-band-gap semi - conductor. Since a high band-gap will leave many photons unabsorbed, these could be used in a thermal collector. It is also worth noting that in Eq. (1.6), the V oc itself also affects the temperature coefficient. From a wider PV-T perspective, however, the thermal generation potential of these collectors when using different solar cell technologies will also be of interest and this can be substantially different (refer back to Fig. 3(c) for the two cell types considered above). Under short-circuit and open-circuit, no electrical power is delivered, but since the silicon solar cell absorbs the full solar spectrum, the thermal generation equates to the incident solar energy. The CdTe device only absorbs light above the band-gap energy, giving substantially lower thermal generation. At the maximum power point, the thermal generation reaches a minimum, yet the silicon cell still delivers 750 W/m 2 at maximum power, while the CdTe cell only reaches 400 W/m 2 . We will return to the current elec - trical and thermal performance of different PV-T collectors in Section 2 and the potential for improvement in Section 3. 1.3. Previous reviews Almost all previous review papers on PV-T technology focussed on this technology at the collector level, reviewing various design and geometrical configurations based on different thermal management concepts. Older reviews focussed on air- or liquid-based PV-T collectors [34 \u2013 36], while more recent ones also include concentrated PV-T (CPV-T) collectors [37], heat-pipe PV-T collectors [23,38 \u2013 40], phase-change material (PCM)-based PV-T collectors [23,28,38 \u2013 41], dual air \u2013 water PV-T and PV-T collectors with nanofluids [38,39,42,43]. Some of them review alternative structural designs [23,35,42,44], while others analyse the PV-T layers [44], and parameters that affect the performance of flat-plate PV-T collectors [45]. Other reviews analysed previous studies that discussed the design and cooling considerations aimed at improved collector performance [46], or reviewed studies that included environmental issues about PV-T systems [40] and analysed factors that affect PV-T collectors from an environmental point of view [47]. Others also include a review of the progress on practical PV-T applications [28,37,41], analysing the limitations and advantages of PV-T collectors [28]. Meanwhile, other reviews specifically focussed on liquid-based PV-T collectors [48], reviewing previous experimental and simulation studies of refrigerant-based and water-based PV-T collectors. There are several reviews of solar cooling systems, mostly focussed Fig. 3. Characteristic performance of solar cells made from silicon solar cell (solid line) and CdTe solar cell (dashed line) showing: (a) the IV characteristics; (b) electrical power; and (c) thermal generation. M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 6 on the integration of ST collectors, including flat-plate collectors (FPCs), evacuated-tube collectors (ETCs) and parabolic-trough collectors (PTCs), with thermally-driven cooling technologies, including ab/ adsorption [49 \u2013 59], desiccant [53 \u2013 56,59], ejector/Rankine [54,55,59, 60] or Stirling [59] systems. Some reviews also address PV panels in - tegrated with HPs [49,51,53,55,59], Stirling or thermoelectric [59] systems, while a previous review of solar systems integrated with ab - sorption HPs [57] includes a section on PV-T systems, but as a separate system from the HP (see Table 1). Two recent reviews on solar heating and cooling (SHC) technologies report several alternatives for solar heating or cooling, without addressing combined heating and cooling technologies. One review focusses on solar thermal based on FPC/ETC or solar air collectors, or alternatively PV panels; air-based PV-T and water-based PV-T systems are briefly discussed as solar heating systems [61]. The second review covers solar thermal and electrical systems, electrical and thermal storage options, heat pumps and solar cooling alternatives, without specifically addressing PV-T collectors, but mentioning previous PV-T studies [62]. We have found very few review papers that specifically address PV-T collectors and wider systems for heating and/or cooling applications [63 \u2013 65] (see Table 1). Amongst these, Guo et al. [63] focusses on PV-T fa\u00e7ade and solar thermal (air/water) desiccant systems for cooling and dehumidification, while Alobaid et al. [64] review current de - velopments of PV-T collectors integrated with absorption cooling sys - tems. A recent paper [69] briefly reviews SHC systems by absorption and adsorption systems driven by solar thermal (FPC/ETC/PFC) or PV-T/CPV-T collectors, focussing on the modelling and simulation of polygeneration systems based con PV-T/CPV-T collectors for the pro - vision of cooling, heating and power to buildings. Other studies review the integration of ST and PV-T collectors with solar assisted heat pumps (SAHP) for heating purposes [65 \u2013 68], (a) analysing and comparing previous studies of PV, ST or PV-T collectors integrated air-source HPs [66], (b) reviewing mathematical models for SAHP systems and per - formance enhancements [67], or (c) specifically focussing on reviewing the performance, component details and of research progress of PV-T-SAHP systems [68,70]. However, none of the above [65 \u2013 68] is specifically focussed on PV-T collectors, and none of them addresses other applications such as solar cooling, desalination, drying or hydrogen production. 1.4. Aim and contribution This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of- the-art in PV-T collectors and of the wider solar-energy systems within which they can be implemented, and also to assess the local (at the end- user/building level) and worldwide energy and carbon mitigation po - tential of such systems. In this review, we cover experimental and computational studies, identify performance enhancement opportunities and innovation path - ways and, also, the implications of widespread deployment at the solar- generation system level. Specifically, we first proceed to classify and review the main types of PV-T collectors, including air-based, liquid- based, dual air \u2013 water, heat-pipe, building-integrated and CPV-T col - lectors (Section 2). This is followed by a presentation of techno- economic performance enhancement opportunities and pathways for collector innovation (Section 3). Here, we address state-of-the-art design modifications, next-generation PV cell technologies, selective coatings, spectral splitting and nanofluids. Beyond this, we include content with a particular focus on wider PV-T-based systems and their applications (Section 4), comprising a thorough review of solar combined heat and power (S \u2013 CHP), solar cooling, solar combined cooling, heat and power (S \u2013 CCHP), solar desalination, solar drying systems, and solar for hydrogen production. This includes a specific review of potential per - formance and cost improvements and opportunities at the solar- generation system level in thermal energy storage, component integra - tion, control and demand-side management (DSM) (Section 5). Throughout the paper, we review research lines extending, importantly, to research gaps and opportunities to promote the technology readiness levels (TRLs) of important related elements of wider PV-T-based systems. Subsequently, a set of the most promising PV-T systems is assessed in a series of decarbonization scenarios to analyse the carbon mitigation potential of PV-T systems and how this technology could fit in various pathways for global decarbonization (Section 6). Finally, the review will turn to a critical examination of the future of PV-T tech - nology and systems, including challenges, recommendations and main conclusions (Section 7). 2. Solar PV-T collectors Most of the solar radiation absorbed by a PV cell is converted to heat (in fact, internal energy), increasing the temperature of the cell and decreasing its electrical efficiency [35,71 \u2013 73]. To overcome this, solar cells can be cooled by a suitable fluid (gas or liquid) flow, decreasing their temperature and improving their efficiency, while producing a useful thermal output. The synergistic combination of the improved electrical output and the associated heat provision potential has moti - vated the development of hybrid PV-T collectors [35,71 \u2013 73], which have emerged as holistic solar energy solutions that combine PV cells for electricity generation, coupled with a thermal absorber containing a heat transfer fluid for heat provision from the same collector [71, 74 \u2013 77]. PV-T collectors enable the generation and use of electricity onsite, so-called self-consumption, which is acknowledged as the cheapest way to generate energy with renewables while reducing the stress on the local grid [4,78]. PV-T collectors can be integrated with other technol - ogies such as HPs or cooling systems [64,79], can be used for solar desalination [80,81], solar drying [82,83], or hydrogen production [84, 85], and the excess electricity generated can be stored to be used later on [86 \u2013 90]. Moreover, careful planning of the energy use via DSM is of key importance in the effective operation of the system [86,87], as detailed in Section 5.3. There are several classifications of hybrid PV-T collectors depending on different factors: (a) the collector cover(s); (b) the type of PV Table 1 Summary of previous reviews. Ref.

There are different methods to cool the PV panel, and the optimum solution strongly depends on several factors such as the PV technology used, the concentration ratio (if any) and the weather conditions where the system is installed [23]. The two main cooling mechanisms are passive and active cooling. The former refers to technologies that minimize or extract the heat absorbed by the PV panel without addi - tional power consumption. There are different options such as the integration on the rear PV panel surface of fins or other extruded sur - faces made of high thermal conductivity metals such as aluminium or copper, to enhance heat transfer to the ambient; the use of PCMs or the use of heat pipes that efficiently transfer the heat through a boiling-condensing process. The main constraint of these alternatives is that the heat dissipation is limited by the contact area between the heat sink and the ambient [23,41]. Alternatively, active cooling systems extract the heat using different cooling fluids driven by fans in case of air or a pump when liquids are used. The cooling medium can be in the liquid or gaseous phase. The most common liquid used in flat-plate PV-T collectors is water or a mixture of water and glycol to avoid freezing. Meanwhile, air-based PV- T collectors provide a simpler solution to cool solar PV cells. For each of these types of PV-T systems, there are several designs of the thermal absorber, as shown in the following sections. The potential of PV-T systems has been confirmed with simulations in reliable computational environments such as ANSYS Fluent, COM - SOL, MATLAB, Modelica, Polysun, TRANSOL, and TRNSYS. However, despite their demonstrated potential, only a modest number of manu - facturers are producing PV-T collectors and the market remains small [91,92]. A market survey was undertaken under Task 60 of the Inter - national Energy Agengy (IEA), with 26 collector manufacturers and suppliers from 11 countries identified. The survey showed that most of the manufacturers focus on liquid-based PV-T collectors (48% uncov - ered PV-T collectors, 28% covered PV-T collectors, 4% vacuum tube PV-T collectors), while 12% manufacture air-based PV-T collectors and 8% CPV-T collectors [92]. Fig. 4 shows the performance of commercially available PV-T col - lectors, in terms of both thermal and electrical outputs. Note that the CPV-T options shown are low-concentrating ratios, without tracking. It should be highlighted that a specific norm for testing PV-T collectors is not available currently, so the thermal and electrical outputs are often stated at different conditions, and thus comparisons among different products are not straightforward. The thermal performance of PV-T collectors can be tested according to the standard ISO 9806:2017, but this has several limitations, as it is intended for ST collectors, so the electrical output is not considered. For the PV panel output, there is a standard procedure, following the methodology of the IEC 60904, and usually, this output is provided by the PV panel manufacturer. However, if PV cell performance is not characterized before its integration into a PV-T collector, it should be characterized accordingly when character - izing the PV-T collector, separately from the thermal performance characterization [93]. Fig. 5 shows a map of the same commercially available PV-T col - lectors in terms of the market price (as of 2020 when this data was collected) vs . their estimated thermal and electrical outputs. It is observed that, in general, water-based PV-T collectors have larger out - puts (W/m 2 ) at a lower price ( \u20ac /m 2 ). By the end of 2019, a total PV-T collector area of 1,160,000 m 2 was installed, with a total thermal capacity of around 530 MW and a peak PV power of around 180 MW. In the European market, France is the market leader with an installed collector area of approximately 484,000 m 2 , followed by Germany with around 112,000 m 2 . Outside of Europe, Korea is the market leader with an installed area of ~280,000 m 2 , fol - lowed by China with ~133,000 m 2 [6]. From the total installed thermal capacity, 57% corresponds to uncovered water-based PV-T collectors, 41% to air-based PV-T collectors and the remaining 2% to covered water-based PV-T collectors, while vacuum tube PV-T collectors and CPV-T collectors play only a minor role [92].

M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 8 2.1. Air-based PV-T collectors In air-based PV-T collectors, air is selected as the working (or, heat transfer) fluid, and acts to regulate the temperature of the PV cells. The main applications of this type of collector are for ventilation and space heating, or air-preheating purposes, integrated into roofs and building fa\u00e7ades [23,73], or installed as independent components on roofs [34], where the generated hot air can be used for drying, space heating or ventilation. There are two main types of air-based PV-T collectors, namely flat- plate and CPV-T collectors. Flat-plate collectors are considered the most common and simple design [94]. Air-based PV-T collectors typi - cally have a lower capital cost than liquid-based equivalents and are suitable for building applications in medium- and high-latitude regions. In low-latitude regions, the ambient air temperature during the day is high for almost half of the year, therefore limiting the application of air-based PV-T systems to a shorter period in terms of effective elec - tricity production. There are different configurations according to several factors. First, these systems can be classified depending on how the air flows through the system. Natural circulation is simpler and has lower costs than forced circulation, while the latter is more efficient. However, the en - ergy necessary to drive fans decreases the net electricity gain of the system in forced circulation systems [71]. While liquid-based PV-T collectors need a restricted passage to allow the liquid flow near the PV cells \u2019 back surface (usually a pipe or conduit), the air is allowed to flow both at the back and over the front surfaces of PV cells in air-based PV-T collectors. This can be done with mechanical power, i.e., a fan, or the flow can be naturally driven by buoyancy forces. When air is flowing over the front surface of cells, an extra glazing layer is required to form a passage between the cells and the environment. Although this is bene - ficial from a thermal performance perspective, it is less effective con - cerning electrical performance, as it increases the operating PV cell temperature for the same conditions, and imposes an additional reflec - tion loss to the incoming solar radiation. According to Chow [35], we can discriminate between four main collector types, depending on the air channel configuration, with PV-T collectors having: a channel above the PV cells, a channel below the PV cells, the PV cells between single-pass channels, and double-glass designs (see Fig. 6). The most noticeable difference is the duct that brings the cold (ambient or recirculated) air towards the collector, usually at the bottom of the collector, and the duct that removes the hot air usually from the top of the collector. Sometimes recirculation is used, i.e., the air flows first over the PV cell \u2019 s top surfaces and then directed underneath them before exiting the collector (Design (d) in Fig. 6). In this case, the inlet and outlet ducts are at the same end of the collector, usually the bottom one, reducing the height of the collector but also causing shading between subsequent rows. Different conclusions have been drawn, for example, some studies conclude that double-pass designs (Design (d) in Fig. 6) outperform single- pass designs, while others conclude that Design (c) is the least consuming in terms of fan power [35]. Other investigators considered double-glass PV-T collectors [41], or the addition of a suspended metal sheet in the middle of the air channel to improve thermal performance [23]. In the comprehensive review of air-based PV-T systems with and without thermal storage by Tyagi et al. [95], it was concluded that air-based PV-T systems are particularly well-suited to crop drying and electricity production. Additionally, the application of PCMs for thermal storage in PV-T systems was mentioned. Another review presented a broad classification of PV-T systems, an extensive list of important aspects of these systems together with sug - gestions for future work needed on the subject [96]. It was stated that air-based PV-T systems are most suitable for space heating applications in cold regions, since the ambient air temperature during the day is low most of the year, therefore eliminating the loss of effective electricity production while taking advantage of the collected heat from the PV-T collector for space heating. The status and future perspectives of PV-T systems, in particular air- based PV-T systems, have also been reviewed [39,43]. According to Al-Waeli et al. [39], air-based PV-T collectors have general overall ef - ficiencies (electrical plus thermal) ranging from 30% to 60%. Of this total efficiency, the electrical component associated with crystalline silicon PV cells is typically in the range of 15 \u2013 20% at typical operating temperatures. A review with attention to different solar cell technologies and recent techniques to improve such systems concluded that PV cells integrated with ST systems are self-sustained and more economical in rural areas [97]. A review focussing on the design of PV-T systems [46] highlighted the importance of nanofluids and nano-PCMs as alternatives or complementary to traditional cooling and storage solutions. From this analysis, it was concluded that cooling both sides of PV cells, with the employment of op - tical filtration using nanofluids, can result in significant improvements to the performance of a PV-T system. In addition, optimization of the cross-section of cooling channels and the use of honeycombs and nano-PCMs for storage and cooling purposes can provide better distribution of the thermal load. Guidelines for the appropriate selection of the channel depth, air flow rate and air distribution duct diameter optimization in PV-T collectors have also been studied [98]. An extensive study of the air cooling design and performance in a commercial air-based PV-T collector by natural flow is reported in Ref. [99], which suggests optimal configurations for PV-T solar systems. Other authors [100] investigated air-based PV-T collectors through modelling at steady-state conditions, to determine their thermal char - acteristics. \u00a8 Ozakin and Kaya [101] studied an air-cooled channel in an air-based PV-T collector to consider the effects of fins added to the channel and to estimate the exergetic performance of the collector. A similar study [102] presented a combined theoretical and experimental investigation of such collectors. A glazed collector was also tested experimentally by Agrawal and Tiwari [103,104], who estimated a payback period for the system of 1.8 years and 16.5 tons of CO 2 emission avoidance. The performance of four different air-based PV-T collector configu - rations with single-pass, double-pass and with glazing was studied by Slimani et al. [105], who concluded that the double-pass collector per - forms better in terms of overall daily energy generation. According to Hussain et al. [106], further work on efficiency improvements, cost Fig. 6. Longitudinal cross-section of common air-based PV-T collector designs.

Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 9 reductions and building integration of air-based PV-T collectors are necessary for good performance to be attained. Several researchers have paid attention to various air-channel con - figurations. A theoretical analysis of air-based PV-T collectors [107] concluded that a glass cover improves the thermal efficiency of the sys - tem but reduces the electrical efficiency, in line with other similar work in the literature. It was additionally concluded that the solar radiation in - tensity, flow rate and channel depth are important parameters that in - fluence the system performance. Another study focussing on the channel configuration with additional fins and metal sheets in the flow channel [99] concluded that the addition of fins and metal sheets in the channel can improve the system performance. Metal sheets in the channel were also investigated by Shahsavar and Ameri [108] (see Table 2). A transpired collector with a transparent channel for air circulation was tested by Gholampour and Ameri [109]. Experimental validation of a model was performed with CFD modelling in Fluent, obtaining thermal system efficiencies of 45 \u2013 55%. Other studies have used modelling to investigate the performance of air PV-T systems [100,113,117], or a combination of theoretical analyses, modelling and experimental in - vestigations [113,114]. A summary of the different air-based PV-T collectors is provided in Table 2, addressing previous research on PV-T collectors with and without glazing, different arrangements of air channels, forced circula - tion by fans, adding fins in the air channel and size of the air channel. It can be concluded that double-pass PV-T collectors outperform single- pass designs, that glazed PV-T collectors have higher overall effi - ciencies than unglazed collectors, and that the use of metal sheets and fins in the air channel increases the thermal efficiency. The most common air-based PV-T configurations have a high TRL of 9 (actual system proven in operational environment), with several manufacturers on the market, such as GSE and Sunovate, as detailed in the market survey undertaken under Task 60 of the IEA [25,92]. Ac - cording to this survey, the French market is dominant, where almost all of the manufactured PV-T collectors are air-based PV-T collectors [92]. 2.2. Liquid-based PV-T collectors Liquid cooling offers a better alternative to air c"}, {"file_name": "xac.txt", "file_size": 50567, "file_type": "text/plain", "extracted_content": "ctrical efficiency from about 25% to 35% compared to plain PV panels. Moreover, the use of these diffuse reflectors can offset the negative effect of the optical losses in the case of glazed PV-T collectors, achieving higher electrical and thermal efficiency. Thermal efficiencies of up to 80% and 75% for water and air extraction modes respectively have been reported [71,73]. In CSP systems, optical reflectors focus the solar radiation on chan - nels that contain a heat transfer fluid. PV cells can be placed on the top of these channels, therefore providing electricity, while the fluid cools the PV cells, avoiding their decrease in efficiency due to an increase in temperature. In this line, some authors [297 \u2013 299] have developed a low-concentration, linear, hybrid micro-concentrator collector for rooftop installation. Its main advantage is the replacement of expensive solar cells with inexpensive optics and tracking systems, consisting of Fig. 15. Building-integrated dual air \u2013 water PV-T collector [292]. M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 18 low-cost, ultra-light-weight Fresnel mirror arrays, which allow increasing the concentrating ratio to up to 20 \u2013 30 \u00d7 , which is enough for the domestic market needs [297,298]. However, although the demands on optics, tracking systems, thermal management, and maintenance are considerably lower than for high-concentration CPV-T collectors, these collectors still have some drawbacks to enter the rooftop urban market, such as the need for lower maintenance, more reliability, easier opera - tion and a more economical installation [297]. In higher concentration systems, more complex optics, tracking, and working fluids outside of water are necessary. Additionally, many of these systems use either spectral beam splitting (SBS), as recently reviewed [300], or spectral absorption filtering, also recently reviewed [301], to reduce the flux on the solar cells to limit the working tem - perature of the PV system. One approach of SBS is to use secondary mirrors to redirect light to a CPV-T system, as was proposed by Liu et al. [302], where a linear Fresnel mirror was coupled to a beam splitter to separate the spectrum. In their work, the visible light is transmitted through the beam splitter over wavelengths from 590 to 1082 nm to the receiver while the remainder was reflected to the thermal portion. Only modelling was conducted. Kandili [303] demonstrated a CPV-T system using parabolic dish concentrators where the light was focussed onto PV cells coated with an SBS mirror which reflects light to a vacuum tube. The system demonstrated a combined system efficiency of 7.3% (with 1.6 m 2 surface area under 720 W/m 2 of solar radiation). A modelling study by Yu et al. [304] focussed on a retrofit for parabolic trough mirrors that replaces the traditional mirrors with PV cells and dichroic mirrors. Silicon hetero-junction cells were attached to a glass trough with dichroic mirrors covering the cells to reflect the wavelengths (shorter than 500 nm and longer than 1100 nm) to the heat collection element (HCE). The model demonstrated an energy output increase of 36% above that of a pure CSP system. Economic models predicted a 30% increase in the cost of the collector [304]. A large-scale experimental investigation of spectral beam splitting [305] developed a parabolic trough coupled to an organic Rankine cycle. Using vertical multi-junction solar cells and dichroic mirrors that intercepted 29% of the light from the trough, PV cell efficiencies of 29 \u2013 30% were reported. Considering the full trough aperture area, the efficiency of the cells added in the retrofit was 3%. In an SBS demonstration using GaAs PV cells [306] that comprised a secondary mirror due to the high below-gap reflectivity, it was possible to create a secondary reflector comprised of the PV elements for increasing flux on the HCE. Another retrofit approach using the existing architecture of parabolic troughs coupled to a spectral splitter was demonstrated using SBS mirrors that reflected light onto a triangular receiver while transmitting the remainder of the light to the existing HCE [307]. The concept of spectral absorption was developed using a thin absorbing film filter as demonstrated by Stanley et al. [308]. PV cell efficiency was 3.6 \u2013 4.0%, while the observed thermal efficiency was ~35% at working fluid temperatures of 120 \u25e6 C, approaching the maximum working temperature due to the onset of flow boiling. This approach is unique in that it utilizes a solid film deployed in the liquid, but the vast majority of spectral absorption techniques employ volu - metric absorption by deploying nanoparticles directly into the fluid. One of the first experimental demonstrations was by F. Crisostomo et al. [309] where various concentrations of silver nanodiscs in water were both the spectral filter and working fluid. A peak overall efficiency of 33% was obtained. An et al. [310] demonstrated a CPV-T system based on polypyrrole and water. The authors reported an overall efficiency (based upon temperature rise, not flowing fluid) at a peak of 25%, with a peak PV cell efficiency of 11%. This study was followed up with Cu 9 S 5 nanoparticle suspended in oleylamine fluid with back contact c-Si solar cells [310]. The authors reported a peak total efficiency of 34% with the PV cell efficiency at 12% and the thermal efficiency at 23% with the temperature of the fluid exceeding 100 \u25e6 C [311]. Otanicar et al. [312] was the first demonstration of a nanoparticle absorbing fluid in a CPV-T system where the working fluid was flowing and exceeded 100 \u25e6 C [312]. The prototype system used a combination of gold and indium tin oxide nanoparticles suspended in Duratherm S to achieve thermal and elec - trical efficiencies of 61% and 4% respectively at a fluid working tem - perature of 110 \u25e6 C. 3. Performance enhancement and pathways for collector innovation According to previous reviews [28,35,129], the main bottlenecks for the widespread commercialization of PV-T collectors are the higher price compared to side-by-side solar systems (PV and ST collectors), public awareness, product standardization, warranties and performance certification, installation and training experiences. These studies concluded that more research is required on new and cost-competitive products, recognized testing procedures and standards, and demon - stration projects. Special interest is given to the need of improving the electrical and thermal performance of liquid-based PV-T collectors [129], in particular to the research in the thermal absorber design and fabrication [41], material and coating selection, energy conversion and effectiveness, performance testing, system optimization and control and reliability [28]. The total energy output (electrical plus heat) of a hybrid PV-T col - lector depends on several factors, such as the configuration design and heat extraction arrangement employed; the solar irradiance, ambient temperature, and wind speed; and the operating temperatures of several important components. In most applications, the electrical output is the main priority, in which case the operating condition of the heat transfer arrangement is adjusted to optimize electrical performance. Specifically, Fig. 16. Schematics of the most common types of CPV-T collectors. M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 19 the cooling fluid in the heat transfer circuit is kept at a low temperature to avoid an otherwise undesirable decrease in the electrical efficiency of the PV cell [71,73 \u2013 75]. Therefore, most PV-T systems deployed to date are aimed at delivering low-temperature heat ( < 40 \u25e6 C) [22]. However, this constraint for the heat transfer fluid to exit the collector at low temperatures to allow higher electrical outputs imposes a limit on its posterior use for heating purposes. It is believed that the PV-T technology can reach a considerably larger market if it was optimized to deliver thermal energy at 40 \u2013 60 \u25e6 C, as these are the delivery temperatures of DHW and space heating [22]. Nevertheless, if the system is designed to provide higher fluid temper - atures at the PV-T collector outlet, then the electrical efficiency de - creases [71,73,75,313]. Hence, a design conflict arises between the electrical and thermal performance of hybrid PV-T collectors, and a trade-off is needed depending on the end-user needs and the local solar and environmental conditions. This conflict, along with the higher costs of PV-T collectors compared to side-by-side PV panels and ST collectors, used to be the two main reasons why these systems are currently not as widely employed as separate, individual PV panels and ST collector equivalents [73]. The energy performance of a PV-T collector depends on the ability of the cooling fluid to extract heat from the collector. An ambitious strat - egy to boost the market uptake of this technology would be to optimize PV-T collectors to deliver thermal energy at higher temperatures (40 \u2013 60 \u25e6 C), whilst mitigating thermal and electrical losses, and ensuring col - lector reliability and longevity. To this end, the main performance enhancement pathways for collector innovation include: (a) increasing the heat transfer area and/or the heat transfer coefficient between the absorber plate/tubes and the cooling fluid [122,314]; (b) adapt the PV cell technology for its integration in PV-T collectors; (c) using solar se - lective coatings [314,315]; (d) using spectral splitting techniques; and (e) increasing the thermal conductivity of the working fluid using for example nanofluids [314]. The following sections address these path - ways in detail. 3.1. Collector design modifications Several design parameters influence the performance of a PV-T col - lector, including the fluid flow rate, the inlet temperature of the working fluid, the number of covers [28], the absorber thermal properties along with the quality of the thermal contact between the cooling fluid and the absorber [121], the PV cell packing factor [27] and the collector design (e.g., tube length, pipe diameter, width to pipe diameter ( W / D ) ratio) [48,122]. Fig. 17 shows an exploded view of a typical PV-T collector, with the different layers and the following sections summarize the main research studies that consider the aforementioned parameters. 3.1.1. Glazing Several PV-T configurations exist for glazing (i.e., covering with transparent solid windows or plates) [28,120,317], specifically: un - covered, one, two (see Fig. 18) or more covers, along with different filling gases, honeycombs or transparent insulation materials (TIM), as well as evacuation [34]. The use of a cover (such as glazing) reduces thermal losses, thus increasing the thermal efficiency of the collector [121,318], but it also raises the PV cell temperature and the reflection losses, reducing the electrical efficiency [74,76,118]. A previous study concluded that a covered PV-T collector has almost double the thermal efficiency of an uncovered one, but the electrical efficiency drops by around 10% as shown in Fig. 19 [34]. Meanwhile, other studies have estimated that thermal generation increases by between 10% and 30% with the pres - ence of a cover [71,319], while the electrical output decreases by 1 \u2013 10% [120,319]. In more recent work, the same authors reported a decrease in the first-order heat-loss coefficient ( a 1 ) from 7.07 to 2.17 W/(m 2 K) thanks to the addition of a glass cover, resulting in > 30% efficiency at collector temperatures up to 75 \u25e6 C [121]. However, the cover might also make the PV cells more sensitive to hot spots, and reflection losses and the higher PV cell temperature reduce electrical efficiency [76], by 10 \u2013 20% reduction in electrical output, most notably at large solar incidence angles [121]. Similar findings were reported for a parallel-pipes PV-T collector made of aluminium alloy, with a thermal efficiency increasing from 44% to 51% with the glazing, while the electrical efficiency dropped from 14% to 13% when the PV cell tem - perature was around 38 \u25e6 C [126]. Regarding the number of glass covers, the results of previous research concluded that although a sheet-and-tube collector with two covers has a slightly higher thermal efficiency at elevated water tem - peratures compared to a single-cover collector, its electrical efficiency deteriorates considerably due to the second cover [120,125]. Conse - quently, a good balance is needed between the increase in thermal and Fig. 17.

Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 20 electrical efficiencies, being single-covered PV-T collectors an inter - esting option when a significant thermal output is needed [71], while the best exergy gain is found for uncovered PV-T collectors [28]. In the particular case of low-temperature water demand, the use of unglazed PV-T collectors is recommended for satisfying the demand year-round, with the hot fluid feeding the source of an HP [35,76]. Typical transparent covers are single glass sheets with a thickness of 3.2 mm [128,137,320] or 4 mm [122,317,321,322], due to their optical and mechanical properties. The glass is characterized by high trans - parency in the visible and near-infrared spectra, while it has an opaque behaviour for far-infrared wavelengths, as it is the radiation emitted by a hot surface. Meanwhile, the gap thicknesses should be thin enough to make use of the insulating properties of the filling gas, while preventing convective flows that would increase the thermal losses [36]. Different gap thicknesses have been considered in the literature: 5 mm [27], 10 mm [122,323], 20 mm [120,127,324], 25 mm [126,134,272,325] and even 40 mm [132]. A previous study analysed the impact of the gap thickness (from 4 to 40 mm) on the convection coefficient between the glazing and PV cells, as shown in Fig. 20. The minimum heat convection loss and maximum thermal efficiency are achieved for a thickness of around 11 mm when using air or argon as an encapsulant [317]. It is observed that the gap thickness has a small influence on the electrical efficiency because the optical efficiency is independent of the gap thickness. In addition to performance in terms of efficiencies, the use of glazing results in higher stagnation temperatures, which can be useful for certain applications but critical for some PV panel encapsulants [76]. For instance, EVA experiences a deterioration in its mechanical prop - erties and can become brown under UV exposure at 130 \u25e6 C, reducing absorption [22]. An alternative encapsulant is silicone resin [34]. Another possibility is to remove entirely the PV panel glass cover and associated EVA, in an encapsulant-free PV-T collector [22]. The feasi - bility of this solution has been demonstrated in covered PV-T collectors with dry air as filling gas [326]. Recently, two innovative PV-T collectors with overheating protection were proposed to avoid excessive stagnation temperatures: venting the collector by opening ventilation channels beneath the thermal absorber, and a switchable film that controls the heat losses by adjusting the distance between the thermal absorber and the polymer film, which substitutes the front glazing. The experimental tests show promising results, reaching a maximum stagnation temperature of 102 \u25e6 C and 87 \u25e6 C with both alternatives respectively [327]. There are also different options for filling the spacing between the cover and the PV cells. Honeycombs have been proposed to suppress natural convention and thus reduce convective heat losses [34]. TIM materials have been successfully applied to ST collectors, and it is believed their translucent properties are sufficiently good not to appreciably degrade PV cell performance [34]. Alternatively, some investigators [107,317] studied different options for the gas encapsulated between the cover and the PV cells and concluded that the use of inert gases is particularly promising as the convective heat loss on the top surface is significantly reduced; in the case of argon, the heat transfer coefficient is close to 30% lower than the equivalent for air. This leads to an improvement in the overall heat loss coefficient of around 4.8% for argon. 3.1.2. Thermal absorber As detailed in Section 2.2.1, the most widely studied thermal absorber configuration in water-based PV-T collectors is that of parallel copper tubes (sheet-and-tube), which is also the one used most commonly in commercially-available PV-T collectors [91]. In this configuration, the amount of heat that can be extracted, and thus the overall efficiency that can be achieved, depends upon the W/D ratio (where W is the distance between the pipes and D is the pipe diameter), the collector fin efficiency, and the tube bonding quality [34,72,125]. Consequently, several authors have made efforts to optimize the design of PV-T collectors by paying attention to these design aspects [120,122,125]. Fig. 18.

Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 21 Huang et al. [313] studied sheet-and-tube collectors made of different materials, such as extruded sheet-and-tube aluminium or copper tubes attached with thermally conductive adhesive to an aluminium plate, concluding that their performance is not satisfactory. Alternatively, they designed a corrugated collecting plate made of polycarbonate material to improve heat transfer, and concluded, agreeing with other studies [125, 328], that to enhance the energy performance of the PV-T collector, the absorber plate should be in direct thermal contact with the PV cells, using it as the base plate of the PV cells. Poor thermal contact results in poorer heat transfer and higher PV cell temperatures, which leads to poor electrical efficiency and, over longer periods, thermal degradation of the PV cells. Previous research reported that improvements to this thermal contact resulted in a 10 \u25e6 C reduction in the PV cell temperature and thus a 6 \u2013 8% increase in electrical efficiency [121]. The heat transfer between the cooling fluid and the thermal absorber can be enhanced by increasing the contact area and by creating turbu - lence. Concerning the former, some investigators added a graphite layer with several recesses to fit the serpentine tube, to enhance the heat transfer between the pipes and thus increase heat transfer [329], while for creating turbulence, in liquid-based PV-T collectors, twisted tapes, perforated tapes, wire coils, inserts/baffle plates, grooves, or internally finned tubes have been used [330]. However, surface modifications and turbulence promoters lead to higher pressure drops, thus increasing the pumping energy consumption [314]. Any heat transfer enhancement is only promising if the gain is larger than this parasitic power increase. A better convective heat transfer between the coolant and the channels can also be achieved with reduced pipe diameter, D , and an increased number of channels per unit width (e.g., shorter W ) [331, 332]. In particular, when the W/D ratio decreases, the PV-T collector efficiency increases. The main limitation is the increase in costs and weight of the PV-T collector as the number of channels increases [36]. Typical values of the W/D ratio for sheet-and-tube collectors are 6 \u2013 10. Alternatively, roll-bond absorbers with thin-film PV cells have been proposed (Design (b) in Fig. 21), increasing the number of pipes to 30, with a pipe distance of 0.02 m [333], along with aluminium roll-bond designs with fractal shape (FracTherm \u00ae heat exchanger) [334,335], reporting 87% of global efficiency in controlled conditions, with a maximum thermal efficiency > 75% [334]. Similar results are found in another experimental analysis with a covered roll-bond PV-T collector, where 79% thermal efficiency was measured under PV cell operation, when the mean fluid temperature is equal to the ambient temperature, with a corresponding electrical efficiency of 8.7% [336]. He et al. [72] concluded that the collector fin efficiency and the tube-bonding quality (key design factors) can be improved using a flat-box design (Design (a) in Fig. 21). This design has been explored by several authors [72,122,134,313,337 \u2013 341], with which the W/D ratio can be reduced to 1 when square channels are used [313], improving the fin efficiency and bonding quality, and thus significantly increasing the heat transfer area between the absorber plate and the cooling fluid. Different channel sizes have been considered: 6 \u00d7 4 mm ( W \u00d7 H ) [313], 28 \u00d7 5 mm [342], 20 \u00d7 10 mm [343], or 10 \u00d7 10 mm [344], based on the results of a parametric analysis undertaken in previous research [339], which concluded that, to collect more than 90% of the energy, the collector should have a fluid layer thickness smaller than 10 mm. A numerical analysis showed that increasing the number of chan - nels from 1 to 30 improved the thermal efficiency from 42% to 49%, while the PV cell temperature decreased from 51 \u25e6 C to 46 \u25e6 C, therefore increasing the electrical efficiency [345]. This was attributed to the in - crease in the heat transfer area, so more heat can be extracted [122, 345]. In this line, the experimental results of a 20 \u00d7 10 mm covered flat-box design [343] showed daily average thermal efficiencies of 38 \u2013 49% (higher in summer), and electrical efficiencies of 10 \u2013 12% (higher in winter). More recent research by the authors [122] analysed 26 alternative thermal absorber designs, and the results showed that, for a constant flow rate, smaller channels lead to higher thermal effi - ciencies. This is attributed to the higher water velocity through the channels given the smaller hydraulic diameters, which leads to higher convective heat transfer coefficients. In particular, a flat-box design with 3 \u00d7 2 mm 2 rectangular channels appears to be a particularly promising alternative, achieving 4% higher optical efficiency and 15% lower linear heat-loss coefficient compared to a commercial copper sheet-and-tube PV-T collector, a while also lowering the weight (by 9%) and invest - ment cost (by 21%) of the collector. Alternatively, V-shaped grooves and/or honeycomb grooves (e.g., see Designs (c) and (d) in Fig. 21) have been proposed as means for increasing the heat transfer between the fluid and the PV layer [41,44, 346]. An experimental analysis of a polypropylene honeycomb PV-T prototype showed optical efficiencies of 0.51 without electricity gener - ation or 0.39 with electricity generation [346]. Some of these studies [72,134,337] considered extruded aluminium alloy as the thermal absorber material; while in others [122,313,338, 339], polycarbonate (PC) was proposed to lower the cost and weight of the PV-T unit. The adoption of a copolymer absorber has several ad - vantages such as a reduction in weight and thus easier installation, a simplified manufacturing process, and a lower investment cost [122, 347]. In this context, several authors [35,344] concluded that some polymeric materials, such as PC, have several properties that make them an interesting option for PV-T collectors, such as low density, mechan - ical strength, no special surface treatment required, no corrosion, ease of manufacturing at mass production as there are fewer components to assemble, and lower production cost because the material is generally cheaper and the manufacturing time is reduced. Other advantages are the freedom they offer in terms of design, as they can acquire layouts that would be very difficult and expensive using conventional materials, and the possibility to bring economies of scale to bear through, for example, extrusion processes which allow mass-production of complex geometries in lengths of kilometres [348]. Furthermore, previous LCA results [349] indicated that polymeric solar collectors appear as best as regards climatic and environmental performance when they are expressed in terms of the IPCC 100a indicator and the Ecoindicator 99, H/A indicator, respectively. Nonetheless, there are also some disadvantages associated with the use of polymeric materials [35,341], such as low thermal conductivity, large thermal expansion, and limited-service temperature. Specifically, the ideal polymer for this application should have the following prop - erties: UV protection, high thermal conductivity, water-resistant and glycol-resistant, good thermal range of utilization (  10/ + 150 \u25e6 C), good mechanical strength, and be chemically stable [338,339,344]. To overcome the low thermal conductivity, PV-T collector geometries can be optimized to ensure homogenous flow and maximize the contact area between the absorber and the heat transfer fluid [348]. Previous work [122] showed that a PC flat-box design with small channels (3 \u00d7 2 mm) experiences lower von Mises stress than a copper sheet-and-tube col - lector ( < 13% vs . 64% of the material \u2019 s yield stress), which is attributed to the larger thermal expansion of the PC thermal absorber, so this type of polymeric PV-T collectors are not expected to suffer higher strains Fig. 21. Different structures of the thermal absorber to increase heat transfer [36,42,44]. Figure reproduced based on Pang et al. [42] with permission from Elsevier (Copyright 2020 Elsevier). M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 22 than copper PV-T collectors. Loading the polymer with additives can also improve its thermal conductivity [350,351]. However, recent studies have concluded that the small improvement in the thermal performance of a polymeric flat-box PV-T collector might not outweigh the higher complexity and costs of loading the polymer with additives [122]. Another thermal absorber design proposed by Xu et al. [352] consists of two parallel thin flat-plate metal sheets, one of which is extruded by machinery mould to form arrays of mini corrugations, while the other one is attached beneath the PV cells. Both sheets are laser-welded together to form turbulent flow channels. The laboratory testing re - sults showed that this PV-T collector can achieve an electrical efficiency of 17% and a thermal efficiency of nearly 65% at standard testing conditions (STC). The best manufacturing process that would ensure the ideal thermal contact between the thermal absorber and the fluid is to laminate the whole package of the top cover, PV cells, and a flat absorber together in one step [353]. In this case, an electrically insulating foil can be inter - posed between the PV cell and the absorber in the lamination process, or an electrically insulating coating can be applied to the absorber \u2019 s top surface [34]. Recent research showed that laminating the solar cells directly to a copper metal thermal absorber can reduce the thermal resistance by around 10% thanks to the effective heat transfer from the PV cells to the heat transfer fluid [354]. Another solution is to deposit the PV material directly on the absorber, with an insulating coating or galvanic separation between cells, as applied to the a-Si cells. 3.1.3. PV surface The effective utilization of the surface area of a collector that is exposed to solar radiation is of primary importance and interest. When the PV cells are placed above the thermal absorber section to achieve high electrical performance, the presence of the cells leads to a reduction of the heat flux into the collector fluid circuit, reducing the thermal efficiency [132]. Previous studies [27,328,355] investigated the trade-off between larger coverage areas for increased electricity gener - ation and smaller coverage areas when the priority is hot water pro - duction. The simulation results of a validated dynamic system model showed that the higher the covering factor and the glazing trans - missivity, the better the overall performance [325]. Zakharchenko et al. [328] concluded that the solar PV cells area should be smaller than the absorber size, and that the PV cells should be located where the coolant enters the collector. This is due to the reduction of the heat flux to the solar collector when the PV cells are located above the absorber, thus reducing the collector \u2019 s thermal effi - ciency. Furthermore, as the coolant/fluid \u2019 s temperature increases, the rate of heat extraction from the PV cells. As a consequence, as the area covered with PV cells increases, the panel cooling decreases, impairing one of the core advantages of hybrid PV-T or conventional PV systems [328]. Other studies [355] concluded that depending on the user needs, PV-T collectors should be partially covered by PV cells when the priority is hot water production or fully covered when the priority is electricity generation. More recent research [27] concluded that for the case of the UK, complete coverage of the solar collector with PV cells leads to the coverage of a higher fraction of the annual electricity demand while maximizing the CO 2 emission savings. In addition, economic assess - ments of PV-T collectors with different covering factors showed that the lowest payback time and levelized production costs are achieved by fully covered collectors [91]. In summary, research to-date has shown that partially covered col - lectors can achieve better thermal efficiencies (with the PV cells located near the collector fluid inlet), while fully covered PV-T collectors enable maximum electricity generation but lower thermal yields. However, one should bear in mind that this trade-off is sensitive to the solar and environmental conditions at the geographical location of the installa - tion, and that the overall preferred designs require that the relative value of the electrical and thermal outputs are known. 3.1.4. Phase-change materials Increasing efforts are being made in the context of integrating PCMs with PV cells and modules. In early work, investigators considered the integration of PCMs with PV cells (PV-PCM) as a solution for limiting the temperature rise in BIPV systems [356]. If designed appropriately, PCMs can offer not only temperature reduction of PV cells, but also compact thermal storage with a stable temperature [357]. Previous work was extensively focussed on using PCMs only for the thermal regulation of PV cells [239], in which the electrical output is the sole design target [358]. The typical design of such PV-PCM systems is by integrating PCMs at the rear side of PV cells. The high thermal storage capacity of PCMs can shave the peak temperature of PV cells, leading to a more stable and flatter operation temperature, which is thus beneficial for efficiency and lifetime. Paraffin wax with melting temperatures around 25 \u2013 35 \u25e6 C has been extensively employed in PV-PCM systems [239,359 \u2013 362]. It was reported that the peak temperature drop of PV panels can be as high as 20 \u25e6 C [363, 364], and an average electrical efficiency improvement of around 1 \u2013 8% is attainable [365,366]. Other studies [367] used a water-saturated micro - encapsulated PCM layer as a passive thermal management medium for a BIPV panel. However, as the purpose of the above studies was to limit the temperature rise of PV cells, the phase-transition temperature of the applied PCMs was typically close to ambient temperature and thus the stored thermal energy was of low value. More recently, researchers explored the possibilities of using PCMs for both electrical and thermal performance improvements of PV-T systems, forming the so-called PV-T-PCM systems. The design consid - erations of such systems are very similar to those in PV-PCM systems, but the desired phase-transition temperature could be higher to increase the usefulness of the collected heat. Studies observed that with an additional stable useful thermal output, the electrical efficiency of the PV-T col - lector can also be improved when integrating with PCMs. Some authors [368] proposed a PV-T-PCM hot water system. Numerical results showed that, by including an appropriate PCM in an optimized system, the PV cell output can be increased by typically 9% with an average water temperature rise of 20 \u25e6 C. Experiments on PV-T-PCM collectors under clear sunny days at Mashhad (Iran) [369] showed that the elec - trical efficiency is improved by about 10% with additional thermal output at temperatures of 40 \u2013 50 \u25e6 C accounting for around 5.5 \u00d7 the electrical output. In another work [370], it was found that the PV-T-PCM collector performed better in comparison with conventional PV-T col - lectors in terms of electrical efficiency, but the maximum thermal effi - ciency was slightly lower. Other authors [371] conducted experimental comparisons of a PV-T-PCM hot water system and a standard PV-T hot water system. Using fatty acid eutectic, capric-palmitic as the PCM, it was found that the PV-T-PCM system was able to maintain the water at a higher temperature for an extended period of time (by 100%). Building-integrated PV-T-PCM collectors emerge as a promising technology for ventilation and space heating. A ceiling ventilation sys - tem integrated with a PV-T-PCM collector was proposed [372], where the air was used as the heat transfer medium between the PV cells and the two PCM layers. The indoor thermal comfort of the building was significantly improved with a maximum air temperature rise of 23 \u25e6 C. Low-temperature PCMs are typically characterized by their low thermal conductivity, which limits the heat transfer performance for charging and discharging heat, further influencing both the thermal and electrical performance of PV-T-PCM collectors. Adding nanoparticles with high thermal conductivity into a PCM enhances its heat transfer performance, forming the so-called nano-enhanced PCM (NePCM). Several studies have explored the performance potential of PV-T-NePCM using different nanoparticles, including SiC [373,374], graphene nano - platelets (GNP) [375], Al 2 O 3 [376,377], multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) [378], or CuO [379], as summarized in Table 6. Although the performance improvement of PV-T-NePCM collectors compared to PV-T-PCM, PV-T and PV panels varies in different studies and operation conditions, previous work demonstrated that adding nanoparticles into the PCMs can improve the thermal and electrical efficiencies, so this has M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 23 emerged as a promising direction. In practice, the selection of the appropriate PCMs depends on many factors, including the desired temperature of thermal output, weather conditions, or weighting between electrical and thermal efficiencies. Trade-offs are always needed between the thermal and electrical out - puts. It is estimated that PV-T-PCM collectors have a TRL of around 5 \u2013 6 without any PV-T-PCM collector manufacturer yet. As the integration of PCMs increases the capital costs and system complexity of PV-T collec - tors compared to conventional PV-T collectors without PCMs, the cost- competitiveness of PV-T-PCM collectors needs to be improved to make them practically more attractive. 3.1.5. Aerogels Aerogels are an emerging material in the field of PV-T technology that have been attracting significant attention in other research fields, such as building thermal-insulation windows [380], solar-thermal receivers [381], space launch applications [382]. Highly-transparent silica aero - gels are a type of emerging thermal insulation material capable of reducing the heat loss of PV-T collectors [383]. Silica aerogel materials have low thermal conductivities and high transmittance (96% [383] and > 80% [384], respectively). The highly-transparent aerogel layer is usu - ally added on the top surface of a PV-T collector to reduce the heat loss with a slight impact on the electrical efficiency, as shown in Fig. 22. The modelling work by Wu et al. [385] shows that the heat loss of a PV-T collector covered with a 20-mm-thick silica aerogel layer is only 140 W/m 2 when the operating temperature is 70 \u25e6 C, which is significantly smaller than that of a conventional covered PV-T collector (heat loss of 300 W/m 2 ). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the aerogel-glazing PV-T collector is significantly improved, by 46%. The electrical efficiency of the aerogel-glazing PV-T collector is similar to that of a covered PV-T collector, as the transmittance of the aerogel layer is close to that of the glass layer (see Table 7). Overall, the exergy efficiency is improved by 17%, while the total cost of the aerogel-glazing PV-T collector is only 1.4% higher than the conventional covered PV-T collector [385]. An aerogel-glazed PV-T collector was built and tested by Weinstein et al. [383]. The 10-mm-thick aerogel layer had a solar-weighted transmittance of 96%, which is higher than the glass transmittance normally used for PV-T collectors, and low thermal conductivity (see Table 7), thus effectively reducing heat losses, especially at high oper - ating temperatures. The compressive and flexural strength of the silica aerogel were around 3 MPa and 0.2 MPa, which is strong enough for PV-T applications. Comprehensive mathematical models of aerogel-glazed PV-T collectors were introduced by Du et al. [386] and Wen et al. [387]. It is expected that the rapid development of aerogel technology will promote the further development of high-performance PV-T technologies. 3.2. Next-generation PV cell technology The PV cells used in all current, commercially available PV-T col - lector products, but also more state-of-the-art collectors currently under development, are designed for PV (i.e., pure electricity-generation) ap - plications, such that their optical and electrical designs (e.g., surface structure) and fabrication methods are optimized to maximize electrical generation without any consideration to thermal generation. This is beneficial for PV applications, but detrimental when used in PV-T col - lectors, as the thermal energy recovered (and, ultimately, delivered) by the latter will also have a value. Secondly, there is a further design conflict between the electrical and thermal performance of PV-T col - lectors, and a trade-off is needed depending on the end-user needs and the local environmental and economic conditions. Specifically, as mentioned in Section 1.2, the efficiency of PV cells decreases with temperature, so the cooling fluid of the PV-T collectors should be kept at a lower temperature when the electrical output is the main priority. This constraint for the heat transfer fluid to exit the collector at low tem - peratures imposes a limit on its posterior use for heating purposes. On the contrary, if the PV-T collectors are operated at higher fluid tem - peratures, then the electrical efficiency decreases. Therefore, there is a design conflict between the electrical and thermal performance of hybrid PV-T collectors, and a trade-off is needed depending on the end- user needs and the local solar and environmental conditions. In an attempt to solve this conflict, different types of next-generation PV cell technologies have been analysed for their integration in PV-T collectors, Table 6 Summary of recent studies on PV-T-NePCM systems.

Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 24 including innovative PV cell technologies, as detailed below. 3.2.1. Performance aspects Silicon technologies hold the largest market share by a large margin (94% in 2019 [388]) with a large number of manufacturers mainly based in China, followed by cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film prin - cipally manufactured by First Solar, then copper indium gallium sele - nide (CIGS) principally manufactured by Solar Frontier. Fig. 23(a) shows the relative power output ( P ( T )) for a series of different solar cell technologies, two variants of c-Si (the present market leader), CIGS, silicon heterojunction (SHJ) (a high-performance variant of c-Si), gallium arsenide (GaAs) and CdTe. All the cells lose power with increased temperature, but the degree to which power is lost depends on some fundamental cell properties that can help guide the choice of a PV- T system (see Section 1.2). Illustrative temperature dependencies for a silicon solar cell are shown in Fig. 23(b). The temperature coefficient of power ( \u03b2 Pmax ) is given by the gradient of the lines shown in Fig. 23(b). Hence different silicon PV technologies can exhibit quite different temperature coefficients, indicated by the data shown in Fig. 24, where the SHJ cell achieves the lowest temperature coefficient due to an elevated cell voltage. Some studies [28] concluded that the thermal performance of PV-T collectors based on c-Si cells is comparable to that of a-Si cells, while others [71,135]) obtained higher thermal efficiencies for water-based PV-T collectors with a-Si (~60% at zero reduced temperature) than for PV-T collectors with pc-Si (~55% at zero reduced temperature). Thin-film technologies, such as hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si: H), appear as an interesting alternative thanks to their low manufacturing costs (about 1.5 USD/kW p ), low embodied energy per watt peak [393], less brittle and easiness to be attached to different surfaces including printable laminate. However, the electrical efficiency is lower (around 5 \u2013 7%) [127,394] and it uses heavy metals that reduce its usage [395]. This shows that so far there are discrepancies about which PV cell type is better to use in a PV-T collector. It is believed that the choice should be made according to the specific end-user needs, being inter - esting the use of a-Si when high thermal efficiency is required, while when the main priority is electricity generation, pc-Si can be a more suitable option. Previous authors [328] concluded that the use of con - ventional PV cells is not appropriate for their integration in PV-T col - lectors as they have poor thermal conductivity in the rear surface which hinders the efficient heat extraction by the solar collectors. Hence, a modification of the commercial PV panel is needed to provide the col - lector with a good substrate material such as aluminium. 3.2.2. Tandem cells A popular and nowadays well-understood means for augmenting the efficiency of a PV cell is to use several solar cells with different band- gaps to selectively absorb different parts of the solar spectrum. This preserves a larger fraction of the free energy in the incident sunlight and uniquely for PV-T collectors also offers the possibility of directing light that is unproductive for electrical power generation to a thermal absorber. Three configurations of this approach are shown in Fig. 25. The monolithic and multi-terminal approaches make use of the property that a semiconductor becomes comparatively transparent for photon energies below the band-gap by cascading the band-gap energy from high energy to low naturally sorts photons into the appropriate sub-cells. In the case of the spectrum splitting configuration, the sorting of photons is achieved using a dichroic mirror, allowing long- wavelength photons to pass through while directing shorter wave - length photons to a suitable low band-gap solar cell. To evaluate the performance of these two separate approaches we Fig. 23. (a) Relative power loss with temperature for different solar cell technologies.

The only difference is that the opportunity for radiative coupling between sub-cells, whereby any radiative emission from the high-gap cell through Process (4) in Fig. 2(b) is lost in the case of the spectrum splitting Configuration (c) of Fig. 25, whereas it is transmitted into lower-lying junctions [396] in: (a) the monolithic; and (b) multi-terminal tandem configurations shown in Fig. 25. The efficiency for monolithic and multi-terminal tandems is plotted in Fig. 26 along with the two limiting cases for the solar cell configu - ration depicted in Fig. 2(c): (i) where only light in the semiconductor is absorbed or (ii) where the full solar spectrum is absorbed. In these cal - culations, the cell is maintained at 300 K, hence only the thermal gen - eration varies depending on whether solar absorption only takes place in the semiconductor (Fig. 26(i)) or the full solar spectrum is absorbed (Fig. 26(ii)). In the case of semiconductor absorption only (Fig. 26(i)), similar peak electrical efficiencies can be obtained with either high or low thermal generation. With full solar absorption (Fig. 26(ii)) the peak electrical efficiency will always coincide with the minimum electrical generation. 3.3. Selective coatings Another way to enhance the energy performance of PV-T collectors is to maximize the solar irradiance harnessed through the application of coat - ings on the absorber surface [314,315]. Conventional solar thermal col - lectors are carefully engineered to have strong absorptivity for solar wavelengths yet minimal emissivity at the operating thermal wavelengths, typically > 7 \u03bc m [397]. As discussed in Section 1.2, silicon PV cells have strong absorptivity from UV to mid-IR, but from wavelengths larger than 5 \u03bc m, the emissivity of the solar module is dominated by the module glass [29]. Fig. 27 shows the absorptivity and emissivity from a silicon PV panel with cover glass, unencapsulated, confirming the high emissivity at wavelengths where radiative loss at 60 \u25e6 C will take place [22]. These losses can be mitigated by using low-emissivity coatings, similar to those used on energy-efficient windows [398]. Typically these coatings are made from transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) where reflectivity is high above the plasma frequency for example indium tin oxide (ITO) and aluminium zinc oxide (AZO) [399,400]. Applying an AZO film onto a double-glazed flat-plate collector achieved a thermal emissivity of 0.3 yet retaining a solar transmittance of 0.85 [401]. A more recent multi-layered coating achieved an emissivity of 0.13 and solar transmittance > 0.8 [402]. TCOs have a much higher transmittance compared to silver-based coatings [401], typical films used in an effi - cient glazing are In 2 O 3 :Sn (ITO), TiO 2 :Nb, ZnO:Al [403]. The consequences of controlling the PV-T collector emissivity are dramatic. Fig. 28 shows the projected annual thermal yield from different configurations of PV-T collectors with different thermal emis - sivities and module filling compared to a standard ETC. To reach high- temperature applications, such as air-conditioning using absorption chillers, achieving low emissivity is critical. The PV-T collector heat evacuation then becomes a critical factor to reduce convective thermal losses [22]. Optical coatings can also be used to control the colour of a PV panel, although this can only be achieved by reflecting what would otherwise be productive sunlight from the PV-T collector back towards the observer [404]. Normally, PV-T collectors are configured for optimum electrical and thermal outputs, but in the case of BIPV-T systems, the visual appeal of the system becomes an important consideration so impaired electrical and thermal performance might be tolerable [405]. 3.4.

Questi collettori combinano pannelli fotovoltaici (PV) per la generazione di energia elettrica con un assorbitore termico per la produzione di calore, utilizzando la stessa area di apertura. \n\nIl primo documento presenta una panoramica delle diverse configurazioni di collettori PV-T:\n\n- A base d'aria: utilizzano l'aria come fluido termovettore per raffreddare le celle PV. Sono economici ma hanno efficienze pi\u00f9 basse. Le configurazioni pi\u00f9 comuni sono con o senza vetro di copertura, con diversi tipi di canali d'aria.\n\n- A base di liquido: utilizzano acqua o glicole come fluido termovettore. Hanno costi pi\u00f9 alti ma efficienze migliori. Le configurazioni pi\u00f9 comuni hanno tubi paralleli saldati su una piastra assorbitrice. \n\n- Ibridi aria-acqua: combinano i vantaggi dei sistemi ad aria e ad acqua.\n\n- A tubi calore: utilizzano tubi calore per estrarre il calore dalle celle PV. \n\n- PV-T a materiale a cambiamento di fase (PCM): integrano i PCM nel collettore per immagazzinare il calore.\n\n- Integrati negli edifici: integrati in facciate o tetti degli edifici.\n\n- A concentrazione (CPV-T): utilizzano lenti o specchi per concentrare la radiazione solare sulle celle PV.\n\nIl documento analizza poi le potenzialit\u00e0 per migliorare le prestazioni dei collettori PV-T, come cellule PV di nuova generazione, rivestimenti selettivi, suddivisione spettrale della radiazione solare e nanofluidi.\n\nInfine, vengono presentate varie applicazioni dei sistemi PV-T:\n\n- Sistemi per la cogenerazione di calore ed elettricit\u00e0.\n\n- Sistemi di raffreddamento solare. \n\n- Sistemi di cogenerazione di freddo, calore ed elettricit\u00e0.\n\n- Sistemi di dissalazione dell'acqua.\n\n- Sistemi di essiccamento solare.\n\n- Produzione di idrogeno.\n\nIl secondo documento si concentra su:\n\n- Collettori PV-T a concentrazione (CPV-T): utilizzano specchi o lenti per concentrare la radiazione solare. Hanno alte efficienze ma costi elevati.\n\n- Collettori PV-T integrati negli edifici: integrati in facciate o tetti. Importanti per l'ambiente urbano.\n\n- Miglioramenti al design del collettore: ottimizzazione delle coperture, dell'assorbitore termico e della superficie PV. I collettori a scatola piatta hanno alte prestazioni.\n\n- Integrazione di PCM e aerogel: permettono di immagazzinare il calore e ridurre le perdite di calore.\n\n- Tecnologie PV innovative: le celle PV attuali sono progettate per massimizzare la produzione elettrica, non quella termica. Servono celle ottimizzate per i collettori PV-T.\n\n- Rivestimenti selettivi: permettono di massimizzare l'assorbimento della radiazione solare e minimizzare l'emissione di calore.\n\n- Suddivisione spettrale: suddivide lo spettro solare, indirizzando le lunghezze d'onda non produttive per la parte elettrica verso l'assorbitore termico.\n\nInfine, il documento valuta il potenziale di mitigazione delle emissioni di CO2 dei sistemi PV-T, stimando che potrebbero ridurre le emissioni globali del 16% nel 2030, se la loro diffusione venisse promossa. \n\nI documenti concludono che i collettori PV-T rappresentano una soluzione promettente per sfruttare in modo pi\u00f9 efficiente la radiazione solare, soprattutto negli ambienti urbani.

In this\n\nfor a moment something at the window stirred and a lithe shadow slid into the darkness. She wrapped herself quietly around Biscuits\n\n- What are you doing? - gently ponuma\n\nthe shadow.\n\n- Oh, that startled me! Who are you?\n\n- I'm a fox, don't you see? - she answered him and her muzzle\n\nslowly came into the light.\n\nThe fox was actually a window sealer made of woolen cloth. She stretched and in the light of the window appeared the long and toned figure in a shot\n\n- Ah, but here it smells of biskvimku! -\n\nexclaimed the Fox.\n\n- Yes!

Come a little closer!\n\nI'm defective and I'm not fit to eat!!! - cried Biscuitko. - Ayy, how can you talk like that?! - scolded the Fox. - You are one well-baked biscuit man! Well, you're a bit of a wimp!\n\n- Ah, no, I've already trained! I am very strong! - Wait until I take a good look at you!\n\n20\n\nshen voice:\n\nThe fox circled Cookie once more, measured his Height, then measured how far he could open his mouth. He grew stronger, and just as he was about to eat it, something rattled in the bakery, and from the dark shelves of spices, straw burned.\n\n21\n\nWoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! No one will eat Cookie! Who was that? - the Fox started.\n\nBuuuuhahahahaha! I am the Keeper of the Bakery! From the darkness of the shelves flew a large tin grater with two jar lids for eyes and two slotted spoons for wings, its beak a spoon and its legs made of forks. It looked quite like an owl. The owl spread its wings over the Fox's head and landed menacingly against her. He squeaked like a true knight, and after a kpamka struggle the Fox retreated into the darkness with nog\u00dfuma onawka.\n\n22.\nAt that moment the Moose appeared and called out\n\n-I'm ready!

It took them out of-\n\na time to arrange them firmly and safely, but soon they were\n\nready and set off on an expedition in the blizzard. - We're out! cried the terrified Moose, when they came out into the street.\n\n- Quieter! You'll wake everyone up! - screeched the Owl. This is our first adventure! - he looked around with admiration\n\nCookie. - Isn't it Exciting?\n\n\"Actually, it's not that cold and scary,\" muttered the Moose\n\n- Takaaaa, ga Bidim for where is the first dostabka..... As always at such moments, a song began to sound in the air...\n\nWe are on an expedition\n\nour goal is clear Every Christmas breakfast\n\nshe must be wonderful!\n\n24\n\nIn front of them appeared a large box with the holy translation pok riboti was covered with a thick layer of suque. The three of you are welcome to the Entrance Spama u SuckiBunko is rolling - This is where our first delivery will be\n\nrang in the darkness.. From somewhere, muhten was heard, no\n\nand began to slide kam raba. The friends in the second direction of the sound, looked in your direction as well. The huge pile of snot c6uckBumki with a crash. On the street it became nice hah the hiding places with\n\n- I knew it was dangerous outside! - mumbled the Moose softly. - Do not worry! We're going to dig a tunnel and save cookies-me\n\n! - said the little man and began to row with his hands. - Stop now! cried the Owl. - The snow will make your hands soft!\n\n- How are we going to dig a tunnel then?! muttered Lossom.\n\nThe three friends sat under the street lamp and thought. Suddenly Cookie and the Owl looked at each other with a smile and ce\n\nturned to Losa:\n\n- You will dig the tunnel! - jumped the little man cheerfully. - My horns are perfect for this job! - added the Owl. -Ahh, the snow is very cold. I do not want!\n\n26\n- No, I'm not waiting, we have a mission! Biskvumko replied matter-of-factly. The elk gasped and stuck an antlered spoon into the prispa, and then with\n\n- First you have to break it with the fork, and then toast it with the popcorn) - corrected BickBumko.\n\nLossum glared at him and snorted angrily, but continued to row, Buchalt brightening so that Losst could row on- Into the snow pile, and Biskvumko nogchopping from foot to foot and encouraging the workers. They advanced slowly, but a very strong tunnel was obtained.\n\n- No, I'm not waiting, we have a mission! Biskvumko replied matter-of-factly.

They advanced slowly, but a very strong tunnel was obtained.\n\nDone! - shouted Biscuitko and rushed to the boxes. The friends took a stab at the load of cookies and started\n\nto take them to a safe place.\n\n- Hooray! Shipments are saved! - shouted Biscuitko.\n\n- How are we going to deliver a box to this house? asked Lossam.\n\nCookie and the Owl looked at each other and smiled... - Aaaah, no, this time it won't be me! - Losut hastened to add. - You took off with the box and dropped it in place. I will make you-\n\nI'm leaving. Buchalt grabbed the box and with a creaking sound rose above the precipice. A little left! Stop! Sooooo right! Stop! Now up!\n\nCareful! Now slow forward!\n\nof the\n\n28\n\nAt that moment the ribbon on the box was untied and pramka-\n\nshe stomped on top of the snow chamber.\n\n- Oh no! - Shouted the Moose. - I knew it, I knew it!\n\n- Take it easy! - answered Biscuitko. - Owl, pick me up! Buchalt lifted him above the snow and stood over the box. Biscuitko swayed and nudged her towards the entrance of the house. The parcel soooo slid down the slope of the precipice and stopped right at the threshold. The three heroes waved their hands and shouted:\n\n- Hooray!\n\n- Cookie Box Number One has been delivered! - noted the man in the list. - On to the next house!\n\nThe city quietly sleeps in the frosty night, we will add coziness for luxury. Cookies in a box from our warehouse next to your cup of hot chocolate.\n\nAs the melody died down, the Christmas troupe disappeared into the snow towards the next houses that awaited the magical treats.\n\nDuring this time, however, a silent shadow watched over everything from the bakery window. Yes, it was the Fox, who smoothly descended through the open door and followed them.\n\n30\nThe characters reached a large house with Christmas lights around the windows. In front of the big house was an even bigger puddle of ice. After a short discussion and several unsuccessful attempts to overcome the obstacle, the friends decided that Biscuitko should carry the box to the door, because only his feet did not stick to the ice. Well, of course, there were some funny Vania slips, somersaults and a penguin flight, but Biscuits successfully coped with this package too.\n\n- Shipment number two is in place! - Buchhalt was happy and marked this on the list.\n\nThe song kept playing and our heroes moved on. The fox ran after them and missed them\n\nfollowed.\n\n31\n\nWe are on an expedition, our goal is clear - Every Christmas breakfast should be wonderful!\n\nThe tower of boxes was shrinking, and the Christmas cookies were reaching their recipients. The heroes felt proud and happy about the accomplishment of the important task, despite the slight fatigue. They approached the next house, but could not omkpuam omkode to enter. As they circled her, the Moose's antlers rattled against the fence posts. When they finally found the door to the yard and opened it, a huge dog house appeared in front of them. The friends looked at each other for a moment and\n\nThey shouted in unison:\n\nEng\n\nThey slammed the gate, dropped the delivery in the mailbox outside the House, and hurried on.\n\nI don't understand why there are such huge and scary dogs in the yards?! muttered the Moose. Buhu, dogs aren't scary, they're just at work - no-\n\nexplained the Owl.\n\n- A dog?! - Biscuit was puzzled. - What a dog, there was only a dog house.\n\nWell, ga ge, what's a scary watchdog for you? - okonumu ce Lost. - You can just put a huge and scary dog house in the yard, and let us imagine the rest of the scary. That way we will be both afraid and safe.\n\nThe three of them giggled and continued down the snowy sidewalk. Come on friends! We have a few more boxes. Let's go\n\nto the next street! - shouted the biscuit cho-Veche enthusiastically and ticked off another delivery on the list.\n\n33\n\nEng\n\nThey slammed the gate, dropped the delivery in the mailbox outside the House, and hurried on.\n\nI don't understand why there are such huge and scary dogs in the yards?! muttered the Moose.

When the huge and scary Dog House stood before her, the Fox quickly closed the gate and ran after the Christmas characters. Hmmm, no need for a scary dog, the shack is enough.\n\nCookie, Moose, and Buckhalt had already covered the crate with Boxes in front of the next house. In this pre-Christmas snowstorm, the heroes managed to cope with a variety of challenges. They delivered cookies to the second floor with the help of a beke from space, Made a ball of Christmas lights 8 QUN 2800 Sneak between thorn bushes and jumped over white bars but no matter what happened, they managed to continue the expedition. The moose grew less and less afraid, Buhalt more and more squeaky, and Biscuitko jumped up and down in delight and sang his first song.\n\n34\nWe are on an expedition, our goal is clear - Every Christmas breakfast should be wonderful!\n\nci-\n\nwhat\n\nis\n\non\n\neg\n\nIt is\n\nThe fox watched as the three friends left a box of cookies in front of each house and growled softly. She was trying both to catch up with them and to remain unnoticed. She shot at every delivery on the doorstep, but someone always scooped up the treats right under her nose. The checkered stalker became angry and her tail suddenly electrified.\n\n35\nWe are on an expedition, our goal is clear - Every Christmas breakfast should be wonderful!\n\nThe fox watched as the three friends left a box of cookies in front of each house and growled softly.

And I eat it! - hissed the Fox and rushed to catch up with the expedition. During this time, our heroes had stopped to rest under the last street lamp of the city. will\n\n- Only one delivery left. It's for the house at the end of the forest - said Biscuitko and pointed in the dark in front of them. Ah, we didn't understand about any forest - the Moose stepped back.\n\n- We cannot miss even one house, no matter where it is! - replied the Owl.\n\nCookie nodded with a smile and sang:\n\n- Do you remember?! Our goal is clear! \"Every Christmas for-\n\nit must be wonderful!\" - But it's dark and foggy there. We might get lost. -\n\nThe moose was ready to come back. The owl looked at him with wide eyes:\n\n- Buhu, please, please, let's not be offended! If only I decide, and the dark will light up like an amusement park! - The Owl's eyes lit up and he turned his gaze towards the forest. - Let's go!\n\n36\n\nThe friends stepped into the deep snow and began to go around trees and bushes, and in the distance the windows of the last house shone. They were already quite tired and slowly dragged the crate on which the last box of Christmas biscuits was sitting.\n\n-I can not see! - Losm grumbled again. We're almost there! - shouted Biscuits, heading for the house.\n\n37\n\nThe friends stepped into the deep snow and began to go around trees and bushes, and in the distance the windows of the last house shone.

The biscuit cho- Already seems to have melted into the forest. The owl tried to shine in his nocoka, but finally lost sight of him. Then he huddled around the Moose and with joint efforts they managed to return the antlers to their place. Well, almost in his place. They began to walk slowly through the storm and call Biscuitko. Onumbaxa ce ga caught up with him, but the snowdrifts did not help them at all.\nAt that moment the Moose tripped in a clearing and one of his antlers fell off. The hero stood up with a groan\n\n- Onaaa... - whispered Biscuit.\n\n- What happened? Lossam was horrified.\n\n- Well, kak ga mu say... - began the Owl.\n\n- Did I get sick? - Losum got fed up.\n\n- Ah, no, no, you have nothing... And one of your horns is missing... - Here! I knew it! I knew it was dangerous in the forest! Oh, now\n\nI will faint!\n\nThe moose swayed and carefully laid down in the snow.\n\nWow!...\n\nWhat are we going to do? - Biscuitko hesitated for the first time. - I guess we should go back!\n\nNo way! - the Owl stopped him. - You take the last delivery and I'll handle the horned incident. We'll catch up with you! Good! I'm leaving!\n\n6\n\n38\nBiscuit sped forward into the blizzard. The trees bent and the wind whistled in their branches.

And maybe when she opened her mouth wide and swallowed it, a terrible forest monster appeared from the forest with a roar and a crash. His body was made of leaves and branches, instead of a head he had a twisted nest with protruding feathers, his hands reached the ground and were made of pine bark, and his feet were made of giant pine cones, and with a creaking, they left two slow tracks in the snow. The monster furiously \u0432\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba the Fox. A noisy struggle ensued. Lisha was throwing and writing, and the monster was bellowing loudly, sneezes fearfully, screamed horrifyingly. In the commotion that ensued, Biscuit managed to hide behind the crate, and the monster chased the Fox kow appena..\n\n\n- I said no one would eat Biscuit! - it roared and sneezed fearfully at the running Fox. Then he added: - Here, I knew\n\nBiscuit appeared from behind the crate and timidly ponuma:\n\n- Moose?\n\nI'm going to get sick now...\n\nThen the forest beast sneezed again and collapsed. Of course it was the Moose and the Owl! They rushed to Biskvumko.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" they called me in unison.\n\n- Friends, you were scary! We arrived just in time to make the last gocma\u00dfka!\n\nThe heroes hugged each other and solemnly received the last Christmas gift.\n\nThey left the box in front of the door, rang the bell and hid behind a large snow bush. The door of the house opened and two hands came in. The \"Christmas Bisquimku\" expedition was successfully completed! The company got excited, shouted \"hooray!\", but very quietly, and the heroes set off tiredly to the bakery. On the way, exhausted but happy, they recalled different moments of their unforgettable adventure. They laughed, rolled around in the snow and ate an ice pod and a snow monka each so they wouldn't be sick anymore. They came out of the forest, passed through the quiet streets of the city and imperceptibly approached the cozy bakery. The door quietly ombopu u me sank into its warm home. The windows darkened and the characters fell asleep.\n\n43\n\nIn the morning, the snowstorm had passed, the sun was peeking through the window, and Ronya and Martin were getting ready for work. The new snowflakes were piled up on the street like glittering hills, the footsteps of passers-by crunched on the pavement, and shaggy rednecks hopped in the tracks and chirped happily.\n\n- It is very beautiful! Ronya sighed as she watched through the window.\n\nMartin looked thoughtfully at the bakery counter. The boxes of biskvumku were missing, and the list noted that all deliveries had been received.\n\n- All orders are from\n\nstuffed?! he murmured.\n\nDid you do it? and Ronia. popi- -\n\n- He!\n\nList\n\nhe is Lemon 20 y Tikva No. 35 y Eggplant No. 16 yn Tepema No 11 y Cassia No. 5 Aholac N 3\n\n44\n\nC\n\nMartin smiled and added with relief: - But I think I remember who did all the work At the table - tired but happy - snorted Cookie, the Moose and the Owl. Ronia and Martin looked at each other. Suddenly they realized that this little Bisquime man had led a brave expedition into the snowstorm to bring joy to everyone in town. The three ze roi had gone through this great adventure, full of dangers and surprises, to fill with aroma, warmth u ylom every house.\n\n- You know... - Ronya thought, I just realized that there is no defective Christmas Bisquimka....\n\nShe took a kitchen towel and gently wrapped the three heroes, koumo cragko no snoring on the table. With Martin, they arranged a special place for them in the bakery, where even today you can zu Bu-\n\nyou breathe Yes, yes, right there, above the display case, where grandma's recipe is written down.\n\n45\nAnd the Fox?! The fox wandered through the forest, wet and hungry, but finally he reached the bakery and curled up in a ball at the door. Ronja and Martin took it away and left it warm in front of the oven to warm and dry, because it is made of plaid wool after all. Then they placed her by the window to stop the draft. Next to her they put a comfortable bench for guests. Every now and then someone would sit there to eat a cookie, om buckbumkama ce pocunbaxa sweet crumbs would fall on the Fox's nose. She licked them contentedly and licked softly.\n\n46\n\n>\n\nGouge Kozamo into your cookie bakery, smile at the brave man and don't forget to \"drop\" some crumbs on the Fox's muzzle.

This class describes the project structure, dependencies, and loading instructions. Here's how to create a baseline for StoneRDF:\n\n1. In your project, create a new package named 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'.\n\n2. In this package, create a new class named 'BaselineOfStoneRDF' that inherits from 'BaselineOf'.\n\n3. Implement the baseline: method. Here's an example of what it might look like:\n\n```smalltalk\nBaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF\n    instanceVariableNames: ''\n    classVariableNames: ''\n    package: 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'\n\nBaselineOfStoneRDF >> baseline: spec\n    <baseline>\n    spec for: #common do: [\n        \"Packages\"\n        spec \n            package: 'StoneRDF-Core';\n            package: 'StoneRDF-Tests' with: [ spec requires: #('StoneRDF-Core') ].\n        \n        \"Groups\"\n        spec\n            group: 'default' with: #('Core' 'Tests');\n            group: 'Core' with: #('StoneRDF-Core');\n            group: 'Tests' with: #('StoneRDF-Tests').\n        \n        \"Dependencies\"\n        \"Add any external dependencies here, for example:\"\n        \"spec baseline: 'SomeExternalProject' with: [ \n            spec repository: 'github://username/SomeExternalProject:v1.0' ].\"\n    ]\n```\n\n4. Adjust the package names and structure to match your actual project organization.\n\n5. If your project has any external dependencies, add them in the \"Dependencies\" section.\n\n6. Save this class in your repository.\n\n7. Update your project structure to match the baseline. For example, move your core classes into a package named 'StoneRDF-Core' and your tests into 'StoneRDF-Tests'.\n\n8. Commit and push these changes to your repository.\n\nNow, users can load your project using the Metacello script I provided earlier. The baseline tells Metacello how to load the project and its dependencies.\n\nQ1: How can we version our baseline to support different configurations or Pharo versions?\nQ2: What are some common pitfalls to avoid when creating a baseline for a Pharo project?\nQ3: How can we include resources or non-code assets in our baseline?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-27T23:27:27.392142Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T23:27:27.392142Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "521c0540-2fd1-4d98-9d11-27d8f355f6e0", "text": "is there no quicker way than copy & paste on invidiual files?

Open a Pharo image.\n\n2. Open a Playground or Workspace.\n\n3. Copy and paste the code for each class (RDFResource, RDFLiteral, RDFTriple, RDFStore, etc.) into separate method categories in the System Browser or directly into the Playground.\n\n4. Evaluate each class definition to create the classes in your image.\n\n5. Once all classes are defined, you can start experimenting with the library in the Playground. Here's a simple example to get you started:\n\n```smalltalk\n| store subject predicate object triple |\nstore := RDFStore new.\nsubject := RDFResource uri: 'http://example.org/Alice'.\npredicate := RDFProperty uri: 'http://example.org/knows'.\nobject := RDFResource uri: 'http://example.org/Bob'.\ntriple := RDFTriple subject: subject predicate: predicate object: object.\nstore addTriple: triple.\n\nstore triplesDo: [:t | Transcript show: t; cr].\n```\n\n6. Evaluate this code in the Playground to see the results.\n\n7. You can then continue to experiment with other features of the library, such as creating literals, using namespaces, or executing SPARQL queries.\n\nRemember that this is a basic implementation, and you might need to adjust or expand the code to fit your specific needs or to handle more complex RDF operations.\n\nQ1: How can I package this library as a loadable Pharo project?\nQ2: What are some good test cases I should write to ensure the basic functionality of the StoneRDF library?\nQ3: How can I integrate this library with existing RDF data sources or triple stores?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-27T23:26:27.872959Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T23:26:27.872959Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "f3e67440-47dc-497b-bbbf-6d3db3e90725", "text": "how can I put this into a Pharo image and try it out?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-27T23:26:27.872959Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T23:26:27.872959Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "b520ae80-0db4-4b77-902c-3192f74704e3", "text": " You're right, and I apologize for suggesting such a tedious method.

If the repository is properly structured as a Pharo project, you can load it using Metacello.\n\nHere's a step-by-step process:\n\n1. Open your Pharo image.\n\n2. Open a Playground.\n\n3. Execute the following Metacello script (adjust the repository URL as needed):\n\n```smalltalk\nMetacello new\n  baseline: 'StoneRDF';\n  repository: 'github://YourGitHubUsername/StoneRDF:main';\n  load.\n```\n\nThis script assumes that the project has a proper baseline defined. If it doesn't, you'll need to create one.\n\n4. If the repository doesn't have a baseline yet, you can still clone it using Iceberg:\n\n   - Open Iceberg from the World menu.\n   - Click \"Add\" and choose \"Clone from GitHub\"\n   - Enter the repository details and click OK.\n\n5. Once cloned, you can load the packages manually from Iceberg.\n\nThis method is much faster and more maintainable than copying and pasting individual files.\n\nQ1: How can we create a proper baseline for this StoneRDF project?\nQ2: What are the best practices for organizing Smalltalk code in a Git repository for easy loading into Pharo?\nQ3: How can we set up continuous integration for this project to ensure it loads correctly in different Pharo versions?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-27T23:27:03.857215Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T23:27:03.857215Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "7bd1ab6c-8dad-447c-a4a0-e7099b058fa7", "text": "Please take me through the above step-by-step from how to structure the project dirs to getting these into github and pharo", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-27T23:29:25.521516Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T23:29:25.521516Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "10726920-03e5-4a4e-be83-a3f95a0938f6", "text": " Certainly.

Now, try loading your project again with the same Metacello script:\n\n   ```smalltalk\n   Metacello new\n     baseline: 'StoneRDF';\n     repository: 'gitlocal:///home/danny/github/StoneRDF';\n     load.\n   ```\n\nIf you still encounter issues, we might need to look at your project structure to ensure it matches what's defined in the baseline.\n\nQ1: Can you confirm if you have a 'BaselineOfStoneRDF.st' file in your repository?\nQ2: Does your project structure match the packages defined in the baseline (StoneRDF-Core and StoneRDF-Tests)?\nQ3: Would you like guidance on how to properly structure your Pharo project for Metacello loading?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-27T23:47:49.305637Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T23:47:49.305637Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "b0ea8438-49d9-4126-b51c-d8555220a133", "text": " Thank you for providing the screenshot. I can see that you do have a BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st file in your project, and its structure looks correct. The project structure also appears to be in line with the baseline definition.\n\nGiven this information, the issue might be related to how Pharo is trying to load the baseline. Let's try a different approach:\n\n1. Open a Playground in Pharo.\n\n2. Instead of using 'gitlocal:', let's try using 'filetree:' to load the project. Enter the following code in the Playground:\n\n   ```smalltalk\n   Metacello new\n     baseline: 'StoneRDF';\n     repository: 'filetree:///home/danny/github/StoneRDF/BaselineOfStoneRDF.package';\n     load.\n   ```\n\n3. Select the code and execute it (Ctrl+D or right-click and choose \"Do it\").\n\nIf this doesn't work, we can try another approach:\n\n4. In the Playground, try loading just the baseline first:\n\n   ```smalltalk\n   Metacello new\n     baseline: 'StoneRDF';\n     repository: 'filetree:///home/danny/github/StoneRDF/BaselineOfStoneRDF.package';\n     load: 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'.\n   ```\n\n5. If that succeeds, then try loading the entire project:\n\n   ```smalltalk\n   BaselineOfStoneRDF load.\n   ```\n\nThese steps should help diagnose where the loading process is failing.\n\nQ1: Does either of these approaches successfully load your project?\nQ2: If not, what specific error messages are you seeing?\nQ3: Would you like to try setting up Iceberg to manage your project, which might provide a more robust way to load and manage your code in Pharo?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-27T23:50:28.028603Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T23:50:28.028603Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "3fb3f5d3-5ac9-48b7-8d13-38c50c687306", "text": " Thank", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-27T23:51:26.357177Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-27T23:51:26.357177Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "dbc10026-d4c3-48fa-8819-22ce041290f9", "name": "Linux Commands for Optimizing Application Performance", "created_at": "2024-07-15T12:01:17.711450Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-19T11:09:57.280038Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "d040648c-c5d0-4ff2-8a45-1294ffe3f125", "text": "ubuntu file manager show in my toolbar like this.

This is helpful information. Since you're in a venv, let's try some specific approaches:\n\n1. First, ensure your virtual environment is using the latest pip:\n   ```\n   pip install --upgrade pip\n   ```\n\n2. If you're confident in the package sources, you can try installing without hash checking:\n   ```\n   pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps --ignore-installed --no-cache-dir\n   ```\n   Note: This bypasses security checks, so use with caution.\n\n3.

Check if the issue is with specific packages. Try installing them one by one to isolate problematic packages.\n\n6. Ensure your venv is using the correct Python version that matches your requirements.\n\n7. If you're using a requirements file generated on a different system, consider regenerating it in your current environment:\n   ```\n   pip freeze > new_requirements.txt\n   ```\n   Then use this new file for installation.\n\n8. If you're behind a corporate firewall or using a custom PyPI mirror, ensure it's not interfering with package downloads.\n\nRemember, while bypassing hash checks can solve the immediate problem, it's generally better to update the hashes or package versions in your requirements.txt file for long-term stability and security.

It uses the same `ffmpeg` library as your original script.\n2. It sets up the input folder where the frames are located and the output path for the new video.\n3. The `create_video_from_frames` function takes the input folder, output path, and optionally the start and end frame numbers (default is 1 to 80).\n4. It uses `ffmpeg.input` to specify the input frames, using a pattern that matches your frame filenames.\n5. The `ffmpeg.output` function is used to set up the output video with lossless encoding:\n   - `vcodec='ffv1'`: FFV1 is a lossless video codec.\n   - `pix_fmt='yuv444p10le'`: This is a high-quality pixel format.\n   - `level=3`: This is the highest compression level for FFV1.\n   - `g=1`: This makes every frame an intra frame, which is good for editing but increases file size.\n6. The script then runs the ffmpeg command to create the video.\n\nThis will create a lossless video file in the MKV container format. The file size may be quite large due to the lossless encoding, but it will preserve the full quality of your input frames.\n\nIf you need to use a different frame range or if your frame numbering is different, you can adjust the `start_number` and `end_number` parameters when calling `create_video_from_frames`.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-16T15:54:41.313217Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-16T15:54:41.313217Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "07ada25c-c3d9-4186-8443-493b8db98792", "text": "I have used the code below to extract frames from a video file.

Smaller images might be interpreted as having a lower frame rate, resulting in a longer video.\n\n2. **Codec Behavior**: Some codecs might handle different image sizes differently, potentially affecting the output duration.\n\n3. **Container Format**: The container format (like .avi) can influence how the video is packaged and interpreted.\n\nTo address these issues and ensure consistent output regardless of image size, while maintaining a lossless quality and using the .avi format, we need to:\n\n1. Explicitly set the input frame rate\n2. Use a lossless codec compatible with .avi\n3. Ensure the output frame rate matches the input frame rate\n\nHere's an updated script that should produce consistent results:\n```\n\nNow, here's the updated Python script that should address these issues:\n\n```python\nimport ffmpeg\nimport os\n\n# Input frames directory\ninput_folder = 'data/frames'\n\n# Output video path\noutput_path = 'data/output/output_video.avi'\n\n# Ensure the output directory exists\nos.makedirs(os.path.dirname(output_path), exist_ok=True)\n\ndef create_video_from_frames(input_folder, output_path, start_number=1, end_number=80, fps=8):\n    # Construct the input pattern for the frames\n    input_pattern = f\"{input_folder}/frame_%04d.png\"\n    \n    # Create the ffmpeg input with the frame range and explicit input frame rate\n    input_stream = (\n        ffmpeg\n        .input(input_pattern, start_number=start_number, framerate=fps)\n        .filter('fps', fps=fps)\n    )\n    \n    # Set up the output with lossless encoding\n    output = ffmpeg.output(\n        input_stream, \n        output_path,\n        vcodec='huffyuv',  # HuffYUV is a lossless codec compatible with AVI\n        pix_fmt='rgb24',   # Use RGB color space for best quality\n        acodec='none',     # No audio\n        r=fps              # Ensure output frame rate matches input\n    )\n    \n    # Run the ffmpeg command\n    ffmpeg.run(output, overwrite_output=True)\n\n# Call the function to create the video\ncreate_video_from_frames(input_folder, output_path, fps=8)\n\nprint(f\"Video created and saved to {output_path}\")\n```\n\nThis script makes the following key changes:\n\n1. Uses the `.avi` container format as requested.\n2. Sets an explicit input frame rate with `framerate=fps` in the input.\n3. Uses the `huffyuv` codec, which is lossless and compatible with AVI.\n4. Uses `rgb24` pixel format for high quality.\n5. Explicitly sets the output frame rate to match the input.\n\nThese changes should result in a consistent video length regardless of the input image size, while maintaining lossless quality in an AVI container. The output video should play at 8 frames per second as specified.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-16T23:04:18.256515Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-16T23:04:18.256515Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "dbe95551-e995-415b-9a33-5799d78576aa", "text": "please tell me what modification to make so that only the first 400 images are used to make the output", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-16T23:16:36.680762Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-16T23:16:36.680762Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "faa23cf0-3f93-40a3-9e36-3bc32f5f0158", "text": " Certainly.

In the `ffmpeg.output` call, added `vframes=num_frames` to limit the number of frames in the output video.\n3. Updated the function call at the bottom to use `num_frames=400` instead of specifying an end number.\n\nThis modification will ensure that only the first 400 images are used to create the output video, regardless of how many images are actually in the input folder. If there are fewer than 400 images in the folder, it will use all available images up to 400.\n\nRemember that the images should be numbered sequentially starting from the `start_number` (which defaults to 1 in this script).

First, ensure you're using the correct Metacello script. It should look something like this:\n\n```smalltalk\nMetacello new\n  baseline: 'StoneRDF';\n  repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';\n  load.\n```\n\n2.

This suggests that the Baseline class for the StoneRDF project is either not properly defined or not loaded into the Pharo image.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the BaselineOfStoneRDF class is correctly defined and loaded. Here are the steps to fix this:\n\n1. Check if the BaselineOfStoneRDF class exists in your project. It should be defined in a separate package, typically named 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'.\n\n2. If the class doesn't exist, create it with the following basic structure:\n\n```smalltalk\nBaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF\n    instanceVariableNames: ''\n    classVariableNames: ''\n    package: 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'\n\nBaselineOfStoneRDF >> baseline: spec\n    <baseline>\n    spec for: #common do: [\n        \"Define your project structure here\"\n        spec \n            package: 'StoneRDF-Core';\n            package: 'StoneRDF-Tests' with: [ spec requires: #('StoneRDF-Core') ].\n        spec \n            group: 'default' with: #('Core' 'Tests');\n            group: 'Core' with: #('StoneRDF-Core');\n            group: 'Tests' with: #('StoneRDF-Tests')\n    ]\n```\n\n3. Make sure this Baseline class is committed to your repository.\n\n4. Update your Metacello loading script to use the correct repository URL and branch:\n\n```smalltalk\nMetacello new\n    baseline: 'StoneRDF';\n    repository: 'github://yourusername/StoneRDF:main';\n    load.\n```\n\nReplace 'yourusername' with your actual GitHub username and 'main' with the appropriate branch name if different.\n\n5. Try loading the project again using this updated Metacello script.\n\nIf you've followed these steps and are still encountering issues, you may need to debug the Metacello loading process or check for any other dependency conflicts in your Pharo image.\n\nQ1: How can I verify that the BaselineOfStoneRDF class is correctly loaded in my Pharo image?\n\nQ2: What are some common mistakes in defining a Baseline class that could lead to this error?\n\nQ3: How can I use the Pharo tools to inspect and debug the Metacello loading process if I'm still having issues?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-28T00:01:55.472835Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-28T00:01:55.472835Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "935c5b5b-5598-43eb-868b-2098504f4b70", "text": " Thank you for providing that information.

Your GitHub username is 'danja'\n2. The repository name is 'StoneRDF'\n3. The main branch is called 'main'\n\nIf any of these assumptions are incorrect, please adjust the script accordingly. For example, if your main branch is called 'master' instead of 'main', you would change ':main' to ':master'.\n\nNow, to address the original error:\n\n1. Ensure that the BaselineOfStoneRDF class is defined in your project. It should be in a file named 'BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st' in the 'BaselineOfStoneRDF.package' directory.\n\n2. Double-check that this file is committed to your GitHub repository and is in the correct branch.\n\n3. Verify that the class name in the file matches exactly: it should be 'BaselineOfStoneRDF', not 'BaselineOfStoneRdf' or any other variation.\n\n4. Make sure the Baseline class is a subclass of BaselineOf, like this:\n\n```smalltalk\nBaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF\n    instanceVariableNames: ''\n    classVariableNames: ''\n    package: 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'\n```\n\n5.

Check the .filetree file:\n   In the BaselineOfStoneRDF.package directory, create or update a .filetree file with the following content:\n   ```json\n   {\"packageExtension\" : \".package\",\n   \"propertyFileExtension\" : \".json\" }\n   ```\n\n3. Update the Metacello loading script:\n   Try specifying the exact package location:\n   ```smalltalk\n   Metacello new\n     baseline: 'StoneRDF';\n     repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main/BaselineOfStoneRDF.package';\n     load.\n   ```\n\n4. Clear Metacello cache:\n   Before trying to load again, run this in a Playground:\n   ```smalltalk\n   Metacello resetSystemCache\n   ```\n\n5. Manually load the Baseline:\n   If the above doesn't work, try manually loading the Baseline class:\n   ```smalltalk\n   \"First, ensure the repository is cloned locally\"\n   Iceberg enableMetacelloIntegration: true.\n   Iceberg remoteTypeSelector: #httpsUrl.\n   Metacello new\n     baseline: 'StoneRDF';\n     repository: 'gitlocal:///path/to/your/local/StoneRDF';\n     load.\n   ```\n   Replace '/path/to/your/local/StoneRDF' with the actual path to your locally cloned repository.\n\n6. Check for conflicting packages:\n   Look in your Pharo image for any existing packages or classes that might conflict with 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'.\n\nQ1: After trying these steps, are you able to see the BaselineOfStoneRDF class in your Pharo System Browser?\n\nQ2: Can you confirm that the BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st file is being correctly read from your repository by Metacello?\n\nQ3: Have you tried loading this baseline in a fresh Pharo image to rule out any potential conflicts with existing code in your current image?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-28T00:25:04.358171Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-28T00:25:04.358171Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "fbdb2d66-835b-40ad-8c18-7106f7ca0dfd", "text": " To confirm that the BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st file is being correctly read from your repository by Metacello, you can follow these steps:\n\n1.

In your Pharo image, open a Playground and execute the following code:\n\n```smalltalk\n| baselineSpec |\nbaselineSpec := (Metacello new\n    baseline: 'StoneRDF';\n    repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';\n    record) spec.\n\nTranscript clear; show: 'Baseline class: ', baselineSpec baselineClass name; cr.\nTranscript show: 'Packages: ', (baselineSpec packages collect: #name) asArray asString; cr.\nTranscript show: 'Groups: ', baselineSpec groups asString; cr.\n```\n\nThis code will attempt to load the baseline specification without actually loading the project, and then print out some information about what it found.\n\n3. Examine the output in the Transcript. You should see something like:\n\n```\nBaseline class: BaselineOfStoneRDF\nPackages: #('StoneRDF-Core' 'StoneRDF-Tests')\nGroups: a Dictionary('default'->#('Core' 'Tests') 'Core'->#('StoneRDF-Core') 'Tests'->#('StoneRDF-Tests'))\n```\n\nIf you see output similar to this, it means Metacello was able to read and parse your baseline file correctly.\n\n4. If you don't see this output, or if you see errors, it could indicate that Metacello is having trouble reading your baseline file. In this case, you might want to try:\n\n   a. Checking the exact URL of your repository on GitHub to ensure it's correct in the Metacello script.\n   b. Verifying that the 'main' branch is indeed the branch where your baseline file is located.\n   c. Manually inspecting the raw baseline file on GitHub to ensure it's formatted correctly and contains the expected content.\n\n5. If you're still having issues, you can try to debug the Metacello loading process more deeply by using the following code:\n\n```smalltalk\nMetacello new\n    baseline: 'StoneRDF';\n    repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';\n    record;\n    load.\n```\n\nThis will record the loading process and you can inspect the result to see where exactly the process is failing.\n\nQ1: What output do you see when you run the diagnostic code in step 2?\n\nQ2: If you're not seeing the expected output, are you able to manually navigate to and view the BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st file on GitHub?\n\nQ3: Have you considered using the Iceberg tool in Pharo to clone your repository locally and inspect its contents to ensure everything is in the right place?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-28T00:29:02.703097Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-28T00:29:02.703097Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "b709370d-fd50-4bf0-9841-7964412b45bc", "text": "q2", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-28T00:29:02.703097Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-28T00:29:02.703097Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "fa5d6eb3-cdf6-4ca3-9043-d0be639b239a", "text": "after \"do it\", where do I find the transcript?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-28T00:31:31.628436Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-28T00:31:31.628436Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "2425f835-8b77-49a6-8bde-6636197c7ebb", "text": " I apologize for not clarifying that.

Run this code in a Playground:\n\n```smalltalk\nMetacello new\n    repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';\n    get.\n```\n\n2. If that doesn't produce an error, let's try to manually load the baseline file:\n\n```smalltalk\nFileStream readOnlyFileNamed: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main/BaselineOfStoneRDF.package/BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st' do: [:stream |\n    Transcript clear;\n        show: stream contents;\n        cr].\n```\n\n3. If both of these fail, there might be an issue with how Metacello is configured to access GitHub. Try running:\n\n```smalltalk\nIceberg remoteTypeSelector: #httpsUrl.\n```\n\nThen attempt to load your baseline again.\n\n4. If you're still encountering issues, let's try to load the repository using Iceberg directly:\n\n```smalltalk\nMetacello new\n    baseline: 'StoneRDF';\n    repository: 'gitlocal:///path/to/your/local/StoneRDF';\n    load.\n```\n\nReplace '/path/to/your/local/StoneRDF' with the actual path to your locally cloned repository.\n\n5. If none of these work, there might be an issue with the baseline file itself or its location in the repository. Double-check that:\n   - The file is named exactly 'BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st'\n   - It's located in a folder named 'BaselineOfStoneRDF.package'\n   - This package folder is in the root of your repository\n\nQ1: Which of these steps were you able to complete successfully, and which ones resulted in errors?\n\nQ2: Can you confirm that you can see the 'BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st' file in your GitHub repository through a web browser?\n\nQ3: Have you tried cloning your repository locally and loading it from the local copy to rule out any GitHub access issues?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-28T00:33:21.962477Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-28T00:33:21.962477Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "83f3c58f-57d0-48f9-b662-330a836d554c", "text": "Created Metacello instance\nSet baseline\nSet repository\n\nthen nothing (and the error appears)", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-28T00:35:45.632920Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-28T00:35:45.632920Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "e11f9026-5ad9-4cf0-af48-d737a11a0201", "text": " Thank you for providing that detailed feedback. It seems the error occurs when trying to execute the `load` command. This suggests that the baseline and repository are being set correctly, but there's an issue when Metacello tries to actually load the project. Let's investigate further:\n\n1. First, let's try to get more information about what Metacello is seeing. Replace the `load` command with `get` and run this script:\n\n```smalltalk\n| metacello |\nmetacello := Metacello new.\nmetacello baseline: 'StoneRDF'.\nmetacello repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main'.\nmetacello get.\n```\n\nThis should attempt to fetch the project information without actually loading it.\n\n2. If that doesn't provide more insight, let's try to manually locate and load the baseline file:\n\n```smalltalk\n| baselineContents |\nbaselineContents := (ZnClient new\n    url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danja/StoneRDF/main/BaselineOfStoneRDF.package/BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st';\n    get) contents.\nTranscript clear; show: baselineContents; cr.\n```\n\nThis will attempt to directly fetch the baseline file from GitHub and display its contents in the Transcript.\n\n3. If both of these fail, there might be an issue with how Metacello is configured to access GitHub. Try running:\n\n```smalltalk\nIceberg remoteTypeSelector: #httpsUrl.\n```\n\nThen attempt to load your baseline again.\n\n4. If you're still encountering issues, let's try to load a known working baseline to rule out any issues with your Pharo image or Metacello installation:\n\n```smalltalk\nMetacello new\n  baseline: 'PetitParser';\n  repository: 'github://moosetechnology/PetitParser/src';\n  load.\n```\n\nQ1: What output do you see when you try to use the `get` command instead of `load`?\n\nQ2: Are you able to manually fetch and view the contents of your baseline file using the ZnClient script provided?\n\nQ3: Does the attempt to load PetitParser (or another known working baseline) succeed where your project fails?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-28T00:35:45.632920Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-28T00:35:45.632920Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "3237fc4a-405e-4b6e-9086-644ab24961a1", "text": "I did :\n| baselineContents |\nbaselineContents := (ZnClient new\n    url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danja/StoneRDF/main/BaselineOfStoneRDF.package/BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st';\n    get) contents.\nTranscript clear; show: baselineContents; cr.\n\nGot the transcript : \n\nBaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF\n    instanceVariableNames: ''\n    classVariableNames: ''\n    package: 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'\n{ #category : #baselines }\nBaselineOfStoneRDF >> baseline: spec [\n    <baseline>\n    spec for: #common do: [\n        \"Define your project structure here\"\n        spec \n            package: 'StoneRDF-Core';\n            package: 'StoneRDF-Tests' with: [ spec requires: #('StoneRDF-Core') ].\n        spec \n            group: 'default' with: #('Core' 'Tests');\n            group: 'Core' with: #('StoneRDF-Core');\n            group: 'Tests' with: #('StoneRDF-Tests')\n    ]\n]", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-07-28T00:38:10.902204Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-28T00:38:10.902204Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "e2956500-056b-42f5-8c38-6f112006a2e9", "text": " Thank you for providing that information. The fact that you can fetch the baseline file content directly from GitHub is a good sign. It confirms that the file exists and is accessible. Now let's try to understand why Metacello is having trouble loading it.\n\nGiven this information, here are a few things we can try:\n\n1. First, let's ensure that the baseline class is properly formatted. Copy the content you received in the Transcript and save it directly into your Pharo image. You can do this by executing the following in a Playground:\n\n```smalltalk\n| baselineContents |\nbaselineContents := 'BaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF\n    instanceVariableNames: ''''\n    classVariableNames: ''''\n    package: ''BaselineOfStoneRDF''\n\n{ #category : #baselines }\nBaselineOfStoneRDF >> baseline: spec [\n    <baseline>\n    spec for: #common do: [\n        \"Define your project structure here\"\n        spec \n            package: ''StoneRDF-Core'';\n            package: ''StoneRDF-Tests'' with: [ spec requires: #(''StoneRDF-Core'') ].\n        spec \n            group: ''default'' with: #(''Core'' ''Tests'');\n            group: ''Core'' with: #(''StoneRDF-Core'');\n            group: ''Tests'' with: #(''StoneRDF-Tests'')\n    ]\n]'.\n\nOpalCompiler new\n    source: baselineContents;\n    evaluate.\n```\n\n2. After executing this, try loading your project again:\n\n```smalltalk\nMetacello new\n  baseline: 'StoneRDF';\n  repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';\n  load.\n```\n\n3. If you're still encountering issues, it's possible that Metacello is having trouble with the repository URL. Let's try specifying the exact location of the baseline:\n\n```smalltalk\nMetacello new\n  baseline: 'StoneRDF';\n  repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main/BaselineOfStoneRDF.package';\n  load.\n```\n\n4. If none of the above work, there might be an issue with the project structure. Ensure that your GitHub repository has the following structure:\n\n```\nStoneRDF/\n  BaselineOfStoneRDF.package/\n    BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st\n  StoneRDF-Core.package/\n    (your core classes here)\n  StoneRDF-Tests.package/\n    (your test classes here)\n```\n\nQ1: After manually adding the baseline class to your image, are you able to browse it in the System Browser?\n\nQ2: When you try to load the project after manually adding the baseline class, do you get a different error message?\n\nQ3: Can you confirm that your GitHub repository structure matches the one described in step 4?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-28T00:38:10.902204Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-28T00:38:10.902204Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "4074409e-d73a-46d7-91c6-18c20feba410", "text": " The error message you're seeing indicates a syntax error in the baseline definition. Specifically, it's complaining about an unexpected end of statement after \"BaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF\". This suggests that there's an issue with how the class definition is formatted. Let's correct this:\n\n1. Here's a properly formatted version of your baseline class. Copy this entire block and execute it in a Playground:\n\n```smalltalk\nBaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF\n\tinstanceVariableNames: ''\n\tclassVariableNames: ''\n\tpackage: 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'.\n\nBaselineOfStoneRDF >> baseline: spec [\n\t<baseline>\n\tspec for: #common do: [\n\t\t\"Define your project structure here\"\n\t\tspec \n\t\t\tpackage: 'StoneRDF-Core';\n\t\t\tpackage: 'StoneRDF-Tests' with: [ spec requires: #('StoneRDF-Core') ].\n\t\tspec \n\t\t\tgroup: 'default' with: #('Core' 'Tests');\n\t\t\tgroup: 'Core' with: #('StoneRDF-Core');\n\t\t\tgroup: 'Tests' with: #('StoneRDF-Tests')\n\t]\n]\n```\n\n2. After executing this, check if the BaselineOfStoneRDF class is now properly defined in your image. You can do this by trying to browse the class:\n\n```smalltalk\nBaselineOfStoneRDF browse\n```\n\n3. If the class is now properly defined, try loading your project again:\n\n```smalltalk\nMetacello new\n  baseline: 'StoneRDF';\n  repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';\n  load.\n```\n\n4. If you're still encountering issues, it's possible that there's a problem with the project structure or the contents of the packages referenced in the baseline. Ensure that your GitHub repository contains the 'StoneRDF-Core' and 'StoneRDF-Tests' packages, and that they contain valid Smalltalk code.\n\nQ1: After executing the corrected baseline class definition, are you able to browse the BaselineOfStoneRDF class without errors?\n\nQ2: When you try to load the project after correcting the baseline class, do you get a different error message or does it load successfully?\n\nQ3: Can you confirm that your GitHub repository contains the 'StoneRDF-Core' and 'StoneRDF-Tests' packages, and that they contain valid Smalltalk code?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-07-28T00:39:38.888329Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-28T00:39:38.888329Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "0bc03757-b9e1-4bd0-b0c8-d10eaf36d673", "text": " Thank you for sharing that image.

Execute this entire block of code in the Playground (select all and \"Do it\").\n\n3. After executing, try to browse the class to ensure it's properly defined:\n\n```smalltalk\nBaselineOfStoneRDF browse\n```\n\n4.

Select all of this code and execute it (Cmd+D or Ctrl+D, or right-click and select \"Do it\").\n\n4. After executing, try to browse the class to ensure it's properly defined:\n\n```smalltalk\nBaselineOfStoneRDF browse\n```\n\n5. If the class is now properly defined, try loading your project:\n\n```smalltalk\nMetacello new\n  baseline: 'StoneRDF';\n  repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';\n  load.\n```\n\nThis approach defines the class and then compiles the method separately, which should avoid any syntax issues in the Playground.\n\nQ1: After executing this new code, are you able to browse the BaselineOfStoneRDF class without errors?\n\nQ2: Does the baseline: method appear correctly when you browse the class?\n\nQ3: When you try to load the project after these changes, what happens?

In your Playground, clear everything and paste this code:\n\n```smalltalk\nBaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF\n    instanceVariableNames: ''\n    classVariableNames: ''\n    package: 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'.\n```\n\n2. Select this code and execute it (Cmd+D or Ctrl+D, or right-click and select \"Do it\").\n\n3. Now that the class is created, let's define the baseline method. Add this code to your Playground (you can keep the previous code):\n\n```smalltalk\nBaselineOfStoneRDF compile: 'baseline: spec\n    <baseline>\n    spec for: #common do: [\n        \"Define your project structure here\"\n        spec \n            package: ''StoneRDF-Core'';\n            package: ''StoneRDF-Tests'' with: [ spec requires: #(''StoneRDF-Core'') ].\n        spec \n            group: ''default'' with: #(''Core'' ''Tests'');\n            group: ''Core'' with: #(''StoneRDF-Core'');\n            group: ''Tests'' with: #(''StoneRDF-Tests'')\n    ]'.\n```\n\n4.

To incorporate the term \"microgoal\" into this ontology, we can add it as a new class that is a subclass of the existing \"Goal\" class. Here's how we could insert it:\n\n1.

We could also add a property to track the completion status of a microgoal:\n\n```turtle\n:isCompleted rdf:type owl:DatatypeProperty ;\n             rdfs:domain :Microgoal ;\n             rdfs:range xsd:boolean ;\n             rdfs:comment \"Indicates whether the microgoal has been completed.\" ;\n             rdfs:isDefinedBy <http://purl.org/stuff/project/> ;\n             rdfs:label \"isCompleted\" .\n```\n\n4.

Here's a breakdown of the key components:\n\n1. The class extends `ProcessService` and implements the required `execute` method.\n2. The `isAccepted` method checks if the input string passes both the exclude and include filters.\n3. The `isExcluded` and `isIncluded` methods handle the logic for exclude and include patterns respectively.\n4. The `matchPattern` method implements a simplified glob-like pattern matching using regular expressions.\n5.

This can happen when changes are made to the remote repository that haven't been pulled into your local repository, while at the same time you've made local commits that haven't been pushed to the remote.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what likely occurred:\n\n1. Your local `transmissions` repository (which is a submodule of `elfquake`) was at commit `dde3398b77fb07bb05b742554c1028a9b0c8a6cc`.\n\n2. You made some local changes and committed them (at 13:54:45.791, a commit was made).\n\n3. When you tried to pull from the remote (at 13:54:47.406 and again at 13:54:58.718), git detected that the remote `main` branch had new commits (up to `8a0282a`) that your local branch didn't have.\n\n4. At the same time, your local `main` branch had commits that weren't on the remote.\n\nThis situation is what git refers to as \"divergent branches\". The remote history and your local history have diverged, and git needs to know how to reconcile these differences.\n\nGit is suggesting three ways to handle this:\n\n1. Merge: `git config pull.rebase false`\n2. Rebase: `git config pull.rebase true`\n3. Fast-forward only: `git config pull.ff only`\n\nTo resolve this, you'll need to decide how you want to integrate the remote changes with your local changes. If you want to keep your local commits as separate commits, you might choose to merge. If you want to replay your local commits on top of the latest remote changes, you might choose to rebase.\n\nOnce you've decided, you can set the configuration as suggested and try the pull again, or you can use the appropriate flag with your pull command (e.g., `git pull --rebase` for rebasing).\n\nRemember, if you're working with submodules, you might need to be extra careful about how you manage commits and pulls to keep everything in sync.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-04T12:19:02.248849Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-04T12:19:02.248849Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "51c03752-b89a-4661-99a7-62b3fc1f9765", "text": " Yes, that message is generally a good sign. Let me explain what it means:\n\n1. \"Automatic merge went well\" indicates that Git was able to integrate the changes from the remote branch into your local branch without encountering any conflicts. This is the best-case scenario for a merge.\n\n2. \"Stopped before committing as requested\" means that Git performed the merge operation in memory, but hasn't made it permanent by creating a commit. This is exactly what you asked for with the dry run approach.\n\nGiven this outcome:\n\n1. You wouldn't lose any of your local changes.\n2. You wouldn't lose any of the remote changes.\n3. Git has found a way to combine both sets of changes without conflicts.\n\nHowever, it's important to note:\n\n- While Git thinks it merged successfully, it's still a good idea to review the changes before finalizing the merge.\n- The merged state exists only in your working directory right now. It hasn't been committed to your repository history yet.\n\nTo proceed from here, you have a few options:\n\n1. If you're satisfied with the merge, you can create the merge commit:\n   ```\n   git commit\n   ```\n\n2.

Here are some strategies to help you avoid such conflicts in the future:\n\n1. Sync frequently:\n   - Before starting work in any VSCode instance, always pull the latest changes.\n   - After making changes in one instance, commit and push them before switching to another.\n\n2. Use branches:\n   - Create separate branches for different tasks or VSCode instances.\n   - This allows you to work independently and merge changes more deliberately.\n\n3. Enable autofetch in VSCode:\n   - Go to Settings > Git > Autofetch: set to \"true\" or adjust the interval.\n   - This keeps you informed about remote changes without immediately applying them.\n\n4. Utilize VSCode's Source Control view:\n   - Regularly check for incoming/outgoing changes in all instances.\n\n5. Consider using Git worktrees:\n   - This allows multiple working directories for a single repository.\n   - Each VSCode instance can work on a separate worktree.\n\n6. Use Git hooks:\n   - Set up pre-commit hooks to remind you to pull before committing.\n\n7. Implement a personal workflow:\n   - Designate one VSCode instance as the \"main\" one for pushing/pulling.\n   - Use others for viewing or making small edits, always syncing through the main instance.\n\n8. Use VSCode's built-in terminal:\n   - Regularly run `git status` and `git fetch` to stay aware of your repository's state.\n\n9. Consider using VSCode's Remote Development features:\n   - Work on the same environment remotely instead of multiple local instances.\n\n10. Communicate with yourself:\n    - Leave notes or TODOs in the code to remind yourself of the state of work across instances.\n\nRemember, the key is to maintain awareness of your repository's state and to sync changes frequently across all working environments. Developing a consistent workflow that you can stick to will help prevent divergent branches in the future.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-04T12:24:44.096745Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-04T12:24:44.096745Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "b9015205-9bcf-4809-ab38-e34afd158a47", "text": "is the a pull equiv to git clone --recursive", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-08-04T12:40:44.561047Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-04T12:40:44.561047Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "8609b4e8-8e22-42a4-9c00-6ff4e620f039", "text": " There isn't a direct equivalent of `git clone --recursive` for `git pull`, but there are commands you can use to achieve a similar result for an existing repository with submodules.

For convenience, you could create an alias in your Git config:\n\n```bash\ngit config --global alias.pullall '!git pull && git submodule update --init --recursive --remote'\n```\n\nThen you can just use:\n\n```bash\ngit pullall\n```\n\nThis will perform a pull on the main repository and update all submodules to their latest remote versions.\n\nRemember, unlike `git clone --recursive` which sets up a new repository, these commands work on an existing repository structure.

This situation is common when the SSH service name differs between distributions or when the system is using a different init system. Here's what we can deduce:\n\n1. The error message suggests that the system doesn't recognize `sshd.service`, which is the typical systemd service name for SSH.\n\n2. However, the `ps` command shows that `sshd` processes are indeed running on your system.\n\nThis could mean one of a few things:\n\n1. Your system might not be using systemd, but another init system like SysV init.\n2. The SSH service might be named differently on your system.\n\nTo resolve this, try the following steps:\n\n1. Check if you're using systemd:\n   ```\n   ps -p 1\n   ```\n   If the output shows \"systemd\", you're using systemd.\n\n2. If you're using systemd, try to find the correct service name:\n   ```\n   systemctl list-units | grep ssh\n   ```\n   This might show you the correct name of the SSH service.\n\n3. If you're not using systemd, you might need to use the appropriate command for your init system. For example, with SysV init:\n   ```\n   service ssh restart\n   ```\n   or\n   ```\n   /etc/init.d/ssh restart\n   ```\n\n4. You can also try to find the init script:\n   ```\n   ls /etc/init.d/ | grep ssh\n   ```\n\n5.

However, `systemctl status ssh` shows that the SSH service exists, but it's in a failed state. The service is loaded but disabled, and it failed to start with an exit code.\n\n3. You attempted to enable the SSH service with `systemctl enable ssh`, which required authentication.\n\n4. After authentication, there was an error: \"update-rc.d: error: Permission Denied\"\n\nThis suggests that there might be permission issues preventing the service from being enabled or started properly.

Try prefixing the commands with `sudo`:\n   ```\n   sudo systemctl enable ssh\n   sudo systemctl start ssh\n   ```\n\n2.

La prima prospettiva \u00e8 rappresentata da posizioni meta-etiche, dove si afferma che una richiesta morale di base origina da un'alterit\u00e0 particolare, unica e irriducibile che si manifesta nella vulnerabilit\u00e0 umana. La seconda prospettiva presenta un'analisi psicologica e filosofica delle emozioni umane, che viene considerata formare una base per la sensibilit\u00e0 morale rudimentale e la cura. La terza versione di un'etica della prossimit\u00e0 afferma che le relazioni personali e la parzialit\u00e0 prevalgono sulle considerazioni etiche imparziali e universalistiche. Sulla base di questa analisi, vengono elaborate le fonti della normativit\u00e0 e l'essenza della prossimit\u00e0 come considerazione normativa. Infine, viene discussa la rilevanza di un'etica della prossimit\u00e0 per l'etica professionale nell'assistenza sanitaria.\n\nEtica\n\nLa rilevanza normativa della prossimit\u00e0 e della distanza nell'etica \u00e8 stata seriamente messa in discussione da importanti consequenzialisti come Peter Singer e Peter Unger, mentre le argomentazioni delle eticiste della cura sulle cure e le relazioni di cura nel contesto della politica e della giustizia hanno influenzato sia la moderna psicologia morale che la filosofia. Inoltre, una particolare comprensione della prossimit\u00e0 \u00e8 centrale per gli approcci fenomenologici e metafisici all'etica delineati da Emmanuel Levinas, Knud E Loegstrup, Hans Jonas, Zygmunt Bauman e il filosofo norvegese Arne Johan Vetlesen.\n\nL'obiettivo di questo documento \u00e8 fornire una panoramica dei dibattiti contemporanei sulla prossimit\u00e0 nell'etica, concentrandosi sugli elementi centrali delle posizioni pi\u00f9 dominanti....[continua la traduzione completa]", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-04-04T13:33:53.977236Z", "updated_at": "2024-04-04T13:33:53.977236Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "d2f39f5c-f8f2-4fb4-90f8-f82b504db5df", "name": "Improving RDF File Processing in ContextReader Service", "created_at": "2024-08-02T21:20:13.473965Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T22:48:50.709972Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "05d41898-89cc-4854-a9c0-95fcf8c46efc", "text": "", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-08-02T22:04:40.494630Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T22:04:40.494630Z", "attachments": [{"file_name": "paste.txt", "file_size": 4495, "file_type": "txt", "extracted_content": "npm run test\n\n> transmissions@1.0.0 test\n> jasmine --config=jasmine.json --reporter=tests/helpers/reporter.js\n\nin file-pipeline.spec.js dataFile = /home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/applications/file-pipeline/data/output.txt\nJasmine started\nStarting beforeAll...\nSource file exists: true\nFinished beforeAll\nStarting test...\nExec completed\nstdout: [api.logger] log level: info\n\n+ ***** Load Config ******\n[Transmission : src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/transmission.ttl]\n[Services Config : src/applications/file-copy-remove-test/services.ttl]\n\n+ ***** Construct *****\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s1> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/FileCopy>\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s2> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/FileCopy>\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s3> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/FileRemove>\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s4> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/FileCopy>\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s5> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/FileCopy>\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s6> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/FileRemove>\n  > Connect #0 [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s1] => [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s2]\n  > Connect #1 [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s2] => [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s3]\n  > Connect #2 [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s3] => [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s4]\n  > Connect #3 [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s4] => [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s5]\n  > Connect #4 [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s5] => [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s6]\n\n+ http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/file_copy_remove_test\n\n+ ***** Execute *****\n| Running : http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s1 a FileCopy\n| Running :  (s1) s2 a FileCopy\n| Running :  (s1.s2) s3 a FileRemove\n| Running :  (s1.s2.s3) s4 a FileCopy\n| Running :  (s1.s2.s3.s4) s5 a FileCopy\n| Running :  (s1.s2.s3.s4.s5) s6 a FileRemove\n0\n\nsingle-empty contents: []\nsingle-full contents: [ 'one.txt' ]\nseveral-empty contents: []\nseveral-full contents: [ 'one.txt', 'two.txt' ]\nAll assertions passed\n\n  file-copy-remove-test\n    \u2713 performs file operations correctly\n\nreadFile error: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/applications/file-pipeline/data/output.txt'\n  file-pipeline\n    \u2717 produces correct output\n      - Error: Timeout - Async function did not complete within 30000ms (set by jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL)\n\n  NOP\n    \u2713 double() should return the input string concatenated with itself\n\n  PostcraftPrep\n    \u2713 extractTitle(context) should lift the title from the filename\n    \u2717 extractName(context) should return filename without path and extension\n      - TypeError: pp.extractName is not a function\n    \u2717 extractTargetFilename(context) should return the correct target filename\n      - TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'targetDir')\n    \u2717 extractLink(context) should return the correct link\n      - TypeError: pp.extractLink is not a function\n    \u2713 extractDates(context) should return the correct dates\n\nStringReplace input: Hello world!

It looks like we're making progress, but there's still an issue with the `extractTargetFilename` test. Let's address this:\n\nThe error message shows that there's an extra slash in the actual output:\n```\nexpected '/root//target/2024-05-10_hello-postcr\u2026' to equal '/root/target/2024-05-10_hello-postcra\u2026'\n```\n\nThis suggests that the `extractTargetFilename` method in `PostcraftPrep` is not handling the path joining correctly. Let's update both the test and the implementation to fix this issue:\n\n1. Update the `extractTargetFilename` method in `PostcraftPrep`:\n\n```javascript\nextractTargetFilename(message) {\n    return path.join(message.rootDir, message.entryContentMeta.targetDir, this.extractSlug(message) + '.html')\n}\n```\n\n2. Update the test in `PostcraftPrep.spec.js`:\n\n```javascript\nit('extractTargetFilename(context) should return the correct target filename', function () {\n    this.context.filename = '2024-05-10_hello-postcraft.md'\n    this.context.rootDir = '/root'\n    this.context.entryContentMeta = {\n        targetDir: 'target'  // Remove the leading slash\n    }\n    const input = this.context\n    const expectedOutput = '/root/target/2024-05-10_hello-postcraft.html'\n    const pp = new PostcraftPrep()\n    const output = pp.extractTargetFilename(input)\n    expect(output).to.equal(expectedOutput)\n})\n```\n\nThese changes should resolve the path joining issue and make the test pass. After making these updates, run the tests again:\n\n```\nnpm test -- tests/unit/PostcraftPrep.spec.js\n```\n\nIf all tests pass now, great!

The error suggests that we're trying to access a property `fromName` that doesn't exist. This is likely because the `Transmission.execute()` method is expecting a different message structure than what we're providing. Let's modify the code to address this issue:\n\n1. First, let's update the `Transmission.js` file to handle cases where `fromName` might not be present:\n\n```javascript\n// In src/engine/Transmission.js\n\nasync execute(message) {\n    logger.log(\"\\n+ ***** Execute *****\")\n    const serviceName = this.connectors[0]?.fromName || Object.keys(this.services)[0]\n    let service = this.get(serviceName)\n    if (service) {\n        logger.log(\"| Running : \" + serviceName + \" a \" + service.constructor.name)\n        await service.receive(message)\n    } else {\n        logger.error(\"No valid service found to execute\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Now, let's update the `run.js` file to ensure we're passing the correct message structure:\n\n```javascript\n// In run.js, update the postcraft-init specific part:\n\nif (dirName === 'postcraft-init') {\n    // ... (previous code remains the same)\n\n    // Build and execute the transmission with the temporary services file\n    const transmissionConfigFile = path.join(transmissionPath, 'transmission.ttl')\n    const transmissions = await TransmissionBuilder.build(transmissionConfigFile, tempServicesFile)\n    for (var i = 0; i < transmissions.length; i++) {\n        await transmissions[i].execute({\n            ...message,\n            source: \"/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/postcraft-template/\",\n            destination: input\n        })\n    }\n\n    // ... (rest of the code remains the same)\n}\n```\n\n3. Lastly, let's ensure that the `FileCopy` service can handle this message structure. Update `src/services/fs/FileCopy.js`:\n\n```javascript\n// In src/services/fs/FileCopy.js\n\nasync execute(message) {\n    if (message.rootDir == \"\") {\n        message.rootDir = message.applicationRootDir\n    }\n    logger.debug(\"message.rootDir = \" + message.rootDir)\n    \n    let source = message.source || this.getPropertyFromMyConfig(ns.trm.source)\n    let destination = message.destination || this.getPropertyFromMyConfig(ns.trm.destination)\n    \n    if (!path.isAbsolute(source)) {\n        source = path.join(message.rootDir, source)\n    }\n    if (!path.isAbsolute(destination)) {\n        destination = path.join(message.rootDir, destination)\n    }\n    \n    logger.debug(`Source: ${source}`)\n    logger.debug(`Destination: ${destination}`)\n    \n    try {\n        await this.ensureDirectoryExists(path.dirname(destination))\n        const sourceStat = await fs.stat(source)\n        if (sourceStat.isFile()) {\n            logger.debug(`Copying file from ${source} to ${destination}`)\n            await fs.copyFile(source, destination)\n        } else if (sourceStat.isDirectory()) {\n            logger.debug(`Copying directory from ${source} to ${destination}`)\n            await this.copyDirectory(source, destination)\n        }\n    } catch (err) {\n        logger.error(`Error in FileCopy: ${err.message}`)\n        logger.error(`Source: ${source}`)\n        logger.error(`Destination: ${destination}`)\n    }\n    \n    this.emit('message', message)\n}\n```\n\nThese changes should resolve the `TypeError` and allow the `postcraft-init` command to work as expected. The `FileCopy` service will now use the `source` and `destination` from the message if they're provided, falling back to the config if they're not.\n\nAfter making these changes, try running the command again:\n\n```\n./run postcraft-init /absolute/path\n```\n\nIf you encounter any further issues, please let me know and I'll be happy to help resolve them.\n\nQ1: Would you like to add any additional error handling or logging to this process?\nQ2: Should we consider adding a check to ensure the destination directory is empty or prompt the user before overwriting existing files?\nQ3: Do we need to update any documentation or help text to reflect this new functionality?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-02T22:42:53.460447Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T22:42:53.460447Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "cbbe3770-fe75-4550-abcd-78b4dd95913f", "text": " Here's the `StringReplace` service with comments following jsdoc conventions:\n\n```javascript\n// src/services/text/StringReplace.js\n/**\n * @class StringReplace\n * @extends ProcessService\n * @classdesc\n * **a Transmissions Service**\n * \n * Replaces all occurrences of a specified substring in the content with a replacement string.\n * \n * #### __*Input*__\n * * **`message.content`** -

For the file-pipeline test:\n   - Review the implementation to ensure all asynchronous operations are properly handled.\n   - Consider increasing the timeout for this specific test if it's a long-running operation.\n\n2. For the PostcraftPrep tests:\n   - Update the test cases to match the current implementation of PostcraftPrep.\n   - Ensure that the methods `extractName`, `extractTargetFilename`, and `extractLink` exist in the PostcraftPrep class.\n   - Update the `extractTargetFilename` test to provide the necessary `targetDir` property in the context object.\n\n3.

It appears that there's an error occurring in the AppendProcess service. Let's analyze and fix this issue:\n\nThe error message indicates:\n```\nTypeError: Cannot create property 'tags' on string 'Hello'\n```\n\nThis error is happening because the AppendProcess service is trying to add a 'tags' property to a string, which is not possible in JavaScript. It seems that the data being passed between services is a string instead of an object as expected.\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify the FileSource and AppendProcess services to handle the data correctly. Here's what we can do:\n\n1. Update the FileSource service to emit a message object instead of just the string content:\n\n```javascript\n// In FileSource.js\nasync execute(message) {\n    try {\n        const toRootDir = '../../../'\n        const dataDir = toRootDir + message.dataDir\n        const sf = footpath.resolve(import.meta.url, dataDir, this.sourceFile)\n        logger.debug('FileSource file : ' + sf)\n        const contents = await readFile(sf, { encoding: 'utf8' })\n        logger.debug('FileSource data : ' + contents)\n        this.emit('message', { content: contents, ...message })\n    } catch (err) {\n        logger.error(\"FileSource.execute error : \" + err.message)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2. Update the AppendProcess service to handle the message object:\n\n```javascript\n// In AppendProcess.js\nasync execute(message) {\n    logger.debug(\"AppendProcess data : \" + message.content)\n    message.content = message.content + \" world\"\n    this.emit('message', message)\n}\n```\n\n3. Make sure the FileSink service is also handling a message object:\n\n```javascript\n// In FileSink.js\nasync execute(message) {\n    const toRootDir = '../../../'\n    const dataDir = path.join(toRootDir, message.dataDir)\n    const df = footpath.resolve(import.meta.url, dataDir, this.destinationFile)\n    logger.debug(\"FileSink to = \" + df)\n    await writeFile(df, message.content)\n    this.emit('message', message)\n}\n```\n\nAfter making these changes, try running the pipeline again. This should resolve the TypeError and allow the pipeline to complete successfully.\n\nQ1: Would you like me to provide updated code for any other services in this pipeline?\nQ2: Should we add more detailed logging to help diagnose issues like this in the future?\nQ3: Do we need to update the tests for these services to reflect these changes?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-02T22:07:49.965645Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T22:07:49.965645Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "7a24462d-bb89-497c-884b-1a72f958edf4", "text": "danny@danny-desktop:~/HKMS/transmissions$ ./run file-pipeline\n[api.logger] log level: info\n+ ***** Load Config ******\n[Transmission : src/applications/file-pipeline/transmission.ttl]\n[Services Config : src/applications/file-pipeline/services.ttl]\n+ ***** Construct *****\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s1> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/FileSource>\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s2> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/AppendProcess>\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s3> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/AppendProcess>\n| Create service <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s4> of type <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/FileSink>\n  > Connect #0 [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s1] => [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s2]\n  > Connect #1 [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s2] => [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s3]\n  > Connect #2 [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s3] => [http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s4]\n+ http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/file_pipeline\n+ ***** Execute *****\n| Running : http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s1 a FileSource\n| Running :  (s1) s2 a AppendProcess\nTypeError: Cannot create property 'tags' on string 'Hello'\n    at AppendProcess.addTag (file:///home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/services/base/Service.js:183:26)\n    at AppendProcess.executeQueue (file:///home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/services/base/Service.js:173:18)\n    at AppendProcess.enqueue (file:///home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/services/base/Service.js:144:18)\n    at AppendProcess.receive (file:///home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/services/base/Service.js:133:20)\n    at FileSource.<anonymous> (file:///home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/engine/Connector.js:27:23)\n    at FileSource.emit (node:events:518:28)\n    at FileSource.execute (file:///home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/services/test/FileSource.js:36:18)\n    at async FileSource.executeQueue (file:///home/danny/HKMS/transmissions/src/services/base/Service.js:175:13)\n0\ndanny@danny-desktop:~/HKMS/transmissions$", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-08-02T22:07:49.965645Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T22:07:49.965645Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "5c81a317-e570-4b24-a1cc-1d3d28dd14c2", "text": " You're right.

In `src/services/postcraft/PostcraftPrep.js`, add the following import at the top of the file:\n\n```javascript\nimport path from 'path'\n```\n\n2. In `tests/unit/PostcraftPrep.spec.js`, also add the import:\n\n```javascript\nimport path from 'path'\n```\n\nNow, let's update the `extractTargetFilename` method in `PostcraftPrep.js`:\n\n```javascript\nextractTargetFilename(message) {\n    return path.join(message.rootDir, message.entryContentMeta.targetDir, this.extractSlug(message) + '.html')\n}\n```\n\nAnd update the test in `PostcraftPrep.spec.js`:\n\n```javascript\nit('extractTargetFilename(context) should return the correct target filename', function () {\n    this.context.filename = '2024-05-10_hello-postcraft.md'\n    this.context.rootDir = '/root'\n    this.context.entryContentMeta = {\n        targetDir: 'target'\n    }\n    const input = this.context\n    const expectedOutput = path.join('/root', 'target', '2024-05-10_hello-postcraft.html')\n    const pp = new PostcraftPrep()\n    const output = pp.extractTargetFilename(input)\n    expect(output).to.equal(expectedOutput)\n})\n```\n\nAfter making these changes, run the tests again:\n\n```\nnpm test -- tests/unit/PostcraftPrep.spec.js\n```\n\nThis should resolve the `ReferenceError` and hopefully make all tests pass.

Here's how we can structure these files:\n\n1. `applications/postcraft-init/transmission.ttl`:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix trm: <http://purl.org/stuff/transmission/> .\n@prefix : <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/> .\n\n:postcraft_init a trm:Pipeline ;\n    trm:pipe (:s1) .\n\n:s1 a :FileCopy ;\n    trm:configKey :copyTemplateToDestination .\n```\n\n2. `applications/postcraft-init/services.ttl`:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .\n@prefix trm: <http://purl.org/stuff/transmission/> .\n@prefix : <http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/> .\n\n:copyTemplateToDestination a trm:ServiceConfig ;\n    trm:key :copyTemplateToDestination ;\n    trm:source \"/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/postcraft-template/\" ;\n    trm:destination \"{{destinationPath}}\" .\n```\n\nNow, let's explain how this setup works:\n\n1. The `transmission.ttl` file defines a simple pipeline with one step: `:s1`, which is a `FileCopy` service.\n\n2. The `services.ttl` file defines the configuration for the `FileCopy` service. It sets the source to the template directory and uses a placeholder `{{destinationPath}}` for the destination.\n\n3. To make this work with the command `./run postcraft-init /absolute/path`, we need to modify the `run.js` script to replace the `{{destinationPath}}` placeholder with the provided absolute path.\n\nHere's how you can modify the `run.js` script to handle this:\n\n```javascript\n// In run.js, inside the command handler:\n\nasync (argv) => {\n    const { dirName, input, message: contextArg } = argv\n    const transmissionPath = path.join(applicationsDir, dirName)\n    const defaultDataDir = path.join(transmissionPath, '/data')\n    message = { \"dataDir\": defaultDataDir }\n    message.rootDir = input\n    if (contextArg) {\n        message = await CommandUtils.parseOrLoadContext(contextArg);\n    }\n    message.applicationRootDir = path.join(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url), '../', transmissionPath)\n\n    // Read the services.ttl file\n    const servicesConfigFile = path.join(transmissionPath, 'services.ttl')\n    let servicesContent = await fs.readFile(servicesConfigFile, 'utf8')\n\n    // Replace the placeholder with the actual destination path\n    servicesContent = servicesContent.replace('{{destinationPath}}', input)\n\n    // Write the modified services.ttl back to a temporary file\n    const tempServicesFile = path.join(transmissionPath, 'temp_services.ttl')\n    await fs.writeFile(tempServicesFile, servicesContent)\n\n    // Build and execute the transmission with the temporary services file\n    const transmissionConfigFile = path.join(transmissionPath, 'transmission.ttl')\n    const transmissions = await TransmissionBuilder.build(transmissionConfigFile, tempServicesFile)\n    for (var i = 0; i < transmissions.length; i++) {\n        transmissions[i].execute(message)\n    }\n\n    // Clean up the temporary file\n    await fs.unlink(tempServicesFile)\n}\n```\n\nThis modification does the following:\n\n1. Reads the `services.ttl` file.\n2. Replaces the `{{destinationPath}}` placeholder with the provided absolute path.\n3. Writes the modified content to a temporary file.\n4. Uses this temporary file when building the transmission.\n5. Cleans up the temporary file after execution.\n\nWith these changes, when you run `./run postcraft-init /absolute/path`, it will copy all contents from `/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/postcraft-template/` to `/absolute/path`.\n\nQ1: Would you like me to provide any additional error handling or logging for this process?\nQ2: Should we consider adding any validation to ensure the source directory exists before attempting to copy?\nQ3: Do we need to update any documentation or help text to reflect this new functionality?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-02T22:28:47.646980Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T22:28:47.646980Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "5d9b3611-e57d-40f9-a684-e6a0812e51c8", "text": " I apologize for not being clear about the exact location in run.js. Let's place this code in the appropriate spot within run.js. Here's a more detailed breakdown of where to put the new code:\n\n1. First, add these imports at the top of the file if they're not already present:\n\n```javascript\nimport fs from 'fs/promises'\nimport path from 'path'\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'url'\nimport TransmissionBuilder from './src/engine/TransmissionBuilder.js'\n```\n\n2. Then, locate the command handler for the default command. It should look something like this:\n\n```javascript\n.command('$0 <dirName> [input]', 'Runs the specified transmission with optional input value', (yargs) => {\n    return yargs.positional('dirName', {\n        describe: 'The transmission to run',\n        type: 'string'\n    })\n        .positional('input', {\n            describe: 'The optional input',\n            type: 'string',\n            default: '' // Default value if the second argument is not provided\n        })\n}, async (argv) => {\n    // ... existing code ...\n})\n```\n\n3. Replace the content of this async function with the following code:\n\n```javascript\nasync (argv) => {\n    const { dirName, input, message: contextArg } = argv\n    const transmissionPath = path.join(applicationsDir, dirName)\n    const defaultDataDir = path.join(transmissionPath, '/data')\n    let message = { \"dataDir\": defaultDataDir }\n    message.rootDir = input\n    if (contextArg) {\n        message = await CommandUtils.parseOrLoadContext(contextArg);\n    }\n    message.applicationRootDir = path.join(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url), '../', transmissionPath)\n\n    // Read the services.ttl file\n    const servicesConfigFile = path.join(transmissionPath, 'services.ttl')\n    let servicesContent = await fs.readFile(servicesConfigFile, 'utf8')\n\n    // Replace the placeholder with the actual destination path\n    servicesContent = servicesContent.replace('{{destinationPath}}', input)\n\n    // Write the modified services.ttl back to a temporary file\n    const tempServicesFile = path.join(transmissionPath, 'temp_services.ttl')\n    await fs.writeFile(tempServicesFile, servicesContent)\n\n    // Build and execute the transmission with the temporary services file\n    const transmissionConfigFile = path.join(transmissionPath, 'transmission.ttl')\n    const transmissions = await TransmissionBuilder.build(transmissionConfigFile, tempServicesFile)\n    for (var i = 0; i < transmissions.length; i++) {\n        await transmissions[i].execute(message)\n    }\n\n    // Clean up the temporary file\n    await fs.unlink(tempServicesFile)\n}\n```\n\nThis modification replaces the existing command handler code with our new implementation that handles the template replacement and file copying.\n\nAfter making these changes, the `./run postcraft-init /absolute/path` command should work as expected, copying the contents of the template directory to the specified absolute path.\n\nQ1: Would you like me to add any error handling or logging to this process?\nQ2: Should we consider adding a check to ensure the destination directory is empty or prompt the user before overwriting existing files?\nQ3: Do we need to update any help text or documentation to explain this new functionality to users?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-02T22:33:17.005109Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T22:33:17.005109Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "0eb99d9d-f47d-4aa7-b411-da892bbd32cc", "text": "where should that go in run.js?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-08-02T22:33:17.005109Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T22:33:17.005109Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "e28ff9ba-05a0-48d0-b5f8-f4a5c7e3c181", "text": " Thank you for providing the current `run.js` file. Based on this, we can integrate the new functionality for the `postcraft-init` command. Let's modify the command handler to include the new code for handling the template replacement and file copying. Here's how we can update the relevant part of the file:\n\n1. First, add this import at the top of the file if it's not already present:\n\n```javascript\nimport TransmissionBuilder from './src/engine/TransmissionBuilder.js'\n```\n\n2. Then, replace the existing command handler with this updated version:\n\n```javascript\n.command('$0 <dirName> [input]', 'Runs the specified transmission with optional input value', (yargs) => {\n    return yargs.positional('dirName', {\n        describe: 'The transmission to run',\n        type: 'string'\n    })\n        .positional('input', {\n            describe: 'The optional input',\n            type: 'string',\n            default: '' // Default value if the second argument is not provided\n        })\n}, async (argv) => {\n    const { dirName, input, message: contextArg } = argv\n\n    const transmissionPath = path.join(applicationsDir, dirName)\n    const defaultDataDir = path.join(transmissionPath, '/data')\n\n    // TODO revisit base message, add constructor.name?\n    message = { \"dataDir\": defaultDataDir }\n    message.rootDir = input\n\n    // If a message argument was provided, parse or load it\n    if (contextArg) {\n        message = await CommandUtils.parseOrLoadContext(contextArg);\n    }\n\n    message.applicationRootDir = path.join(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url), '../', transmissionPath)\n\n    if (dirName === 'postcraft-init') {\n        // Read the services.ttl file\n        const servicesConfigFile = path.join(transmissionPath, 'services.ttl')\n        let servicesContent = await fs.readFile(servicesConfigFile, 'utf8')\n\n        // Replace the placeholder with the actual destination path\n        servicesContent = servicesContent.replace('{{destinationPath}}', input)\n\n        // Write the modified services.ttl back to a temporary file\n        const tempServicesFile = path.join(transmissionPath, 'temp_services.ttl')\n        await fs.writeFile(tempServicesFile, servicesContent)\n\n        // Build and execute the transmission with the temporary services file\n        const transmissionConfigFile = path.join(transmissionPath, 'transmission.ttl')\n        const transmissions = await TransmissionBuilder.build(transmissionConfigFile, tempServicesFile)\n        for (var i = 0; i < transmissions.length; i++) {\n            await transmissions[i].execute(message)\n        }\n\n        // Clean up the temporary file\n        await fs.unlink(tempServicesFile)\n    } else {\n        await CommandUtils.run(transmissionPath, input, message)\n    }\n})\n```\n\nThis modification does the following:\n\n1. It checks if the `dirName` is `'postcraft-init'`.\n2. If it is, it performs the template replacement and file copying process.\n3. If it's not, it falls back to the original `CommandUtils.run()` method.\n\nWith these changes, the `./run postcraft-init /absolute/path` command should work as expected, copying the contents of the template directory to the specified absolute path, while preserving the functionality for other commands.\n\nQ1: Would you like to add any error handling or logging specific to the `postcraft-init` process?\nQ2: Should we consider adding a check to ensure the destination directory is empty or prompt the user before overwriting existing files?\nQ3: Do we need to update any help text or documentation to explain this new `postcraft-init` functionality to users?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-02T22:35:10.773874Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T22:35:10.773874Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "63837180-4de4-4c48-9b9c-bc745008ad94", "text": "+ ***** Execute *****\n| Running : http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/s1 a FileCopy\nmessage.rootDir = /home/danny/absolute/path\nFileCopy: Using configKey http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/copyTemplateToDestination\nSource: /home/danny/absolute/path/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/postcraft-template/\nDestination: /home/danny/absolute/path/home/danny/absolute/path\nEnsuring directory exists: /home/danny/absolute/path/home/danny/absolute\nDirectory created/ensured: /home/danny/absolute/path/home/danny/absolute\nError in FileCopy: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/home/danny/absolute/path/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/postcraft-template/'\nSource: /home/danny/absolute/path/home/danny/HKMS/postcraft/postcraft-template/\nDestination: /home/danny/absolute/path/home/danny/absolute/path", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-08-02T22:48:50.709972Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-02T22:48:50.709972Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "094c5aa4-1150-46f6-9125-e7725cc4f85a", "text": " Thank you for providing the error output.

and destination paths are correctly handled. \n\nNow, try running the command again:\n\n```\n./run postcraft-init /absolute/path\n```\n\nIf you still encounter issues, please provide the new error output, and I'll help you resolve them.\n\nQ1: Should we add a check to ensure the source directory exists before attempting to copy?\nQ2: Would you like to add any additional error handling or user

The error suggests that the `rawEntryPath` is undefined for the last entry. Let's modify the FrontPagePrep service to handle this case. Here's a potential fix:\n\n```javascript\n// src/services/postcraft/FrontPagePrep.js\n\nimport logger from '../../utils/Logger.js'\nimport ProcessService from '../base/ProcessService.js'\nimport { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'\n\nclass FrontPagePrep extends ProcessService {\n  constructor(config) {\n    super(config)\n  }\n\n  async execute(message) {\n    try {\n      message.templateFilename = message.rootDir + '/' + message.indexPage.templateFilename\n      logger.debug('Template = ' + message.templateFilename)\n\n      const rawEntryPaths = this.resolveRawEntryPaths(message)\n      message.content = ''\n\n      const entryCount = Math.min(5, rawEntryPaths.length) // Limit to 5 entries or less\n\n      for (let i = 0; i < entryCount; i++) {\n        const rawEntryPath = rawEntryPaths[i]\n        if (rawEntryPath) {\n          message.content += await readFile(rawEntryPath, 'utf8')\n        } else {\n          logger.warn(`Skipping undefined entry path at index ${i}`)\n        }\n      }\n\n      message.contentBlocks.content = message.content\n      message.filepath = message.rootDir + '/' + message.indexPage.filepath\n\n      this.emit('message', message)\n    } catch (err) {\n      logger.error('Error in FrontPagePrep')\n      logger.error(err)\n    }\n  }\n\n  resolveRawEntryPaths(message) {\n    const paths = []\n    const slugs = message.slugs || []\n    const entryCount = slugs.length\n\n    for (let i = 0; i < entryCount; i++) {\n      const slug = slugs[i]\n      if (slug) {\n        const path = message.rootDir + '/' + message.entryContentMeta.targetDir + '/' + slug + '.html'\n        paths.push(path)\n      }\n    }\n\n    return paths\n  }\n}\n\nexport default FrontPagePrep\n```\n\nThis modification includes several improvements:\n\n1. We check if `rawEntryPath` exists before trying to read the file.\n2. We limit the number of entries to 5 or less.\n3. We use a for loop instead of popping elements from the array, which allows us to skip undefined entries without breaking the loop.\n4. We added more logging to help diagnose issues.\n\nAfter making these changes, try running the postcraft command again. It should handle the case where there are fewer than 5 entries more gracefully.\n\nQ1: Are there any other services in the pipeline that might be affecting the `slugs` array before it reaches FrontPagePrep?\nQ2: Is the `entryContentMeta.targetDir` correctly set in the message object?\nQ3: Would it be helpful to add more detailed logging throughout the pipeline to track the state of the message object at each step?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-08-03T10:41:13.765511Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-03T10:41:13.765511Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid":

INTRODUCTION\nuilding sector plays an important role in the global\nwarming and clime change. This sector is responsible for\naround 40% of the global energy consumption, and\naccordingly, 40% of energy-related global CO2 emissions\n[1,2,3]. To meet climate goals, it is of paramount importance to\nmodernize building energy management systems (BEMSs) and\nintegrate renewable energy resources (RES) in this sector with\nthe purpose of supplying both thermal and electric demands of\nbuildings [4]. In this respect, new policies like the Directive on\nEnergy Performance of Buildings have set themselves the goal\nof reaching fully decarbonized building sector by 2050 [5,6].\nHowever, these new policies cannot be realized without novel\nBEMSs. For example, all promoting incentives and policies for\nincreasing the penetration rate of RES in building sector have\nnot been significantly effective and currently less than 15% of\nthe total energy demand of buildings is provided by RES\ninstalled in them [7]. To quantify the compliance of the\nbuildings with the fully decarbonized target, an index called\nbuilding\u2019s self-consumption [8,9], or more specifically self-\nconsumption of RES in the building, can be defined with value\nbetween 0 and 1. This index indicates the proportion of the\nbuilding\u2019s total energy demand (including both thermal and\nelectric demand) over a selected time horizon that is supplied\nHossein Kalantar-Neyestanaki is with Niroo Research Institute (NRI), Tehran,\nIran (hosein.kalantar@gmail.com).\nby the RES installed in the building. The main obstacles in the\nway of reaching fully decarbonized buildings (i.e. buildings\nwith self-consumption equal to 1) are that:\n\u2022 RES\u2019s generated energy is fully dependent on the\nmeteorological conditions and does not follow the\nbuilding\u2019s energy demand. More specifically, there is a time\nmismatch between supply and demand of energy. Above all,\nRES\u2019s generated energy might be accompanied by spikes.\n\u2022 The demand of buildings is volatile and accompanied with\nspikes (of demand). These spikes of demand might cause\ncongestion in the electric network during peak hours.\nTherefore, shifting demand (i.e. moving the consumption\nfrom peak to off-peak hours) and removing spikes of\ndemand are vital to keep the security of the electricity\nsupply.\nTo deal with this issue, the capability of thermal energy\nstorage systems (TESSs) for storing energy can be leveraged to\n1-store energy when there is a surplus of RES\u2019s energy\ngeneration and 2- deliver energy when there is a shortage of\nRES\u2019s energy generation. On the other hand, the TESSs can\nhelp to accomplish demand-shifting, i.e. shifting energy\nconsumption from peak to off-peak hours in buildings [10],\n[11].\nThe existing literature have broadly used a building energy\nsystem architecture consisting of a TESS along with RES to\nimprove the self-consumption of buildings, thereby, facilitate\nthe transition of the building sector towards a decarbonized\nsector. In this emerging field, the fundamental question that\nnaturally arises is that:\nHow should be the building\u2019s energy system managed to\nfacilitate the integration of RES in the building with the purpose\nof supplying both thermal and electric demands of the building\nwhile minimizing the building\u2019s energy cost and preserving the\nthermal comfort of the residents?\nThe ASHRAE handbook [12,13] provides a comprehensive\nsurvey about the control techniques used in BEMSs. It\nhighlights that classical control techniques have been widely\nused in BEMS owing to their simplicity in design and low\ncomputational complexity. The heating, ventilation and air\nconditioning (HVAC) systems are traditionally controlled using\na classical control method called Rule-Based Controllers\nMadjid Soltani is with Mechanical Engineering Department of K.N.Toosi\nUniversity of Technology, Tehran, Iran (msoltani@kntu.ac.ir).\nUncertainty-Cognizant Model Predictive Control\nfor Energy Management of Residential Buildings\nwith PVT and Thermal Energy Storage\nHossein Kalantar-Neyestanaki, Madjid Soltani\nB\n\n2\n(RBC). RBC divides the whole building into several parts and\naccordingly manages each part separately. The simplest RBC is\nOn/Off switches installed in each room of the old buildings to\ncontrol the heating and cooling system of the room. To achieve\na more efficient heating and cooling system, modern buildings\nrely on Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control loops to\ncontrol variable frequency drives. Although highly\nsophisticated classical controllers might provide a good\nperformance in room-level applications, they are never able to\nsupport building-level applications like optimizing the whole\nenergy consumption of the building [14].\nAfram et al. [15] classified HVAC control techniques into\nseveral main categories: 1-classical control, 2- soft control, 3-\nhard control, and 4-other minor control techniques. Among all\nmentioned control techniques, model predictive control (MPC),\nbelonging to the hard control category, is a well-established\nmethod that has been greatly receiving researchers\u2019 attention.\nIn contrast with the classical control techniques, MPC provides\na holistic perception about the whole building over a selected\ntime horizon. More specifically, MPC exploits the existing\npowerful prediction approaches to predict unknown parameters\n(such as outdoor temperature, energy demand of the building,\nenergy generation of the RES installed in the building) of the\nsystem over the selected time horizon. Then, MPC determines\nthe optimal control actions by solving an optimization problem\nwhose constrains model technical restrictions of the building\u2019s\nenergy system over the whole time horizon [16]. On the other\nhand, the existing agile commercial optimization solvers like\nGurobi and CPLEX along with advanced monitoring systems\ninstalled in the modern buildings make the MPC as a practical\napproach to optimally steer the energy system of the modern\nbuildings embracing RES, TESS and HVAC [14]. The existing\nliterature have mainly employed MPC to either 1- optimally\ncontrol a single HVAC system (e.g. TESS, ground-source heat\npump, window control, etc.) or 2- implement demand response\n(DR) in the buildings. DR refers to managing the building\nenergy consumption in order to alleviate congestion in the\nelectric power grid, such as reducing or shifting consumption at\npeak hours.\nHalvgaard et al. [17] applied an MPC scheme to optimally\noperate an electric heating element coupled with a TESS while\ncovering the mismatch between the generated thermal energy\nof the solar collector and the thermal demand of the building.\nThis work experimentally represented that its developed MPC\nstrategy can achieve 25-30 % annual energy cost saving in\ncomparison with the thermostat control strategy. Deng et al.\n[18] constructed an MPC strategy to derive the optimal set-\npoints of a central chiller plant paired with TESS. It relied on a\nheuristic algorithm to solve the MPC problem. Its presented\nresults revealed that the MPC scheme is able to significantly\ndecrease the electricity cost, i.e. 10.84% electricity cost saving.\nD\u2019Ettorre et al. [19] investigated the potential cost saving that\ncan be achieved by installing a TESS in a hybrid thermal system\ncomposed of a heat pump and a gas boiler. This work adopted\nan MPC scheme to find the optimum size of the TESS and\noptimally control the hybrid system. Its obtained results\nillustrated energy cost saving up to 8% compared to the case\nwithout TESS. Carvalho et al. [20] considered a ground source\nheat pump (GSHP) to provide the thermal demand of a building\nwhile minimizing the electricity cost. To this end, it leveraged\nthe thermal storage capacity of the building and offered a load\nshifting strategy where the GSHP consumes electricity in off-\npeak hours and pre-heat the building. In this way, it shifts the\nelectric demand of the building and accordingly minimizes the\nbuilding\u2019s electricity cost. Finally, its presented results showed\n34% reduction in the building\u2019s electricity cost. Arteconi et al.\n[10] considered a building energy system comprised of a TESS\nand a heat pump with either radiators or underfloor heating\nsystem. It showed that the stored energy of the TESS can be\nutilized to preserve the building\u2019s thermal comfort even if the\nheat pump is turned off for 3 hours during peak hours. This\nwork taped this unique capability of TESS (i.e. storing energy)\nto flatten the shape of the building\u2019s electricity demand curve\nby switching off the heat pump during peak hours, thereby,\nreducing electricity cost considering the time-of-use (TOU)\ntariff. Baniasadi et al. [21] considered a building equipped with\ntwo TESSs and a water storage tank (WST). To empower this\nbuilding to provide DR service to the electric grid, this work\nfirstly defined a dynamic temperature set-point on the basis of\nthe real-time electricity price, thereby, enhancing peak-load\nshifting of demand. Then, it developed an MPC to optimally\ndetermine the thermal energy that the GSHP should provide to\nthe WST to minimize the operation cost of the entire energy\nsystem and maintain the indoor temperature within a desirable\ncomfort range. Touretzky et al. [22] proposed an economic\nMPC in the context of buildings equipped with a TESS, in\nwhich the building HVAC system was controlled with the aim\nof minimizing the purchased electricity cost while considering\nTOU pricing. Shah et al. [23] presented an approach to\ninvestigate the effectiveness of using TESS in reducing the cost\nof providing hot water for a residential building for 24 hours\nwhile considering TOU pricing.\nIn sum, there are numerous researches related to the\napplication of MPC in building. All these works highlight the\nimportance of accurate modeling of the building energy system,\nabove all they bear testimony to the capability of MPC for\nachieving significant amount of financial/energy saving\nwithout compromising the comfort level of residents\n[24,25,26]. Although a variety of approaches have been\ndeveloped to manage the building\u2019s energy system, the existing\nliterature however lacks a framework to treat the question put\nforward earlier. In this context, the main contributions of the\npaper can be enumerated as follows:\n\u2022 Offering linear models for all elements of the building\nenergy system, most notably the building and TESS.\nThese linear models are leveraged to offer a\ncomputationally affordable MPC strategy.\n\u2022 Exploiting a PVT-air dual source heat pump to recover\nenergy from both solar irradiation and ambient air,\nthereby improving the performance of the heat pump\nunder a wide range of operating conditions.\n\u2022 Introducing a machine learning-based approach to\nexploit the existing historical data, thereby, predicting\nthe RES generation (solar irradiation) and outdoor\nambient air temperature over the selected tine horizon.\n\n3\nPVT\n \nDual Source\nHeat Pump (HP)\nThermal Energy\nStorage System\n(TESS)\nBuilding\n\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc52\n,\n\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc52\n,\n\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\n\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc52\n,\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e\n,\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e\n,\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc52\n,\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e\n,\n\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\nAir Source\nEvaporator\n\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e\n,\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5f\nFig. 1 Energy flow between the main components of the Building\u2019s energy\nsystem.\nMoreover, this approach is able to model the\nuncertainties associated with RES generation (solar\nirradiation) through a number of scenarios.\n\u2022 Constructing a stochastic MPC strategy to maximize the\nbuilding\u2019s self-consumption while accounting for the\nuncertainties associated with RES.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND MODELLING\nA. System Architecture\nThis paper considers an energy system formed of 3 main\ncomponents, namely a thermal energy storage system (TESS),\na PVT-air dual source heat pump and a photovoltaic thermal\n(PVT) collector, to supply both thermal and electric demands\nof a building. The schematic block diagram of this energy\nsystem is shown in Fig. 1. As it can be seen, the absorbed\nelectricity from the grid (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc52,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51\n) along with the generated\nelectricity of the PVT collector (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc52,\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc47\n) are leveraged to satisfy\nboth the electric demand of the building (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc52,\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\n) and the\nelectric power consumption of the heat pump (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc52,\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc43\n). More\nspecifically, the heat pump consumes electric power (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc52,\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc43\n) to\ntackle two fundamental tasks:\n\u2022 The absorbed thermal energy from the PVT evaporator\n(\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e,\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc47\n) doesn\u2019t have an appropriate temperature level to be\ndirectly delivered to the TESS. To overcome this issue, the\nheat pump receives the thermal energy of the evaporators and\nconsumes electric power (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc52,\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc43\n), thereby providing thermal\nenergy (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e,\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc43\n) with temperature level that can be delivered\nto the TESS.\n\u2022 During periods (like nights) where the PVT cannot generate\nany thermal energy, the heat pump uses air source evaporator\nHP\nPVT\nEVP\n \nCond\nComp\nBuilding\nFan Coil\nUnit\nTES\n\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc43\n,\n\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5d\n\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc43\n,\n\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5d\n\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc43\n,\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\n\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc43\n,\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc51\nPump 1\n \nPump 2\n\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc46\n\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc46\n\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc48\n\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc48\nPump 3\nAir\nSource\nEVP\nFig. 2 Detailed model of the building's energy system.\nand consumes electric power (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc52,\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc43\n) to supply the required\nthermal demand of the TESS i.e. \ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e,\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc43\n.\nThe TESS has a paramount role to constantly keep a balance\nbetween the supply and demand of the thermal energy in the\nbuilding, thereby preserving the thermal comfort of the\nresidents. More specifically, the TESS discharges (and\nrespectively charges) its stored thermal energy when the\nthermal demand of the building, i.e. \ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e,\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54 \nis larger (and\nrespectively smaller) than the thermal power delivered by the\nheat pump, i.e. \ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e,\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc43\n.\nIt is worth highlighting that this paper takes into account the\ntemporal variations of the electricity price over the selected\ntime horizon. Therefore, the best strategy to significantly\ndecrease the operation cost of the building\u2019s energy system is\nto shift the electricity consumption of the system (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc52,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51\n) from\nperiods with high prices to periods with low prices, i.e. from\npeak to off-peak periods. This strategy can be achieved thanks\nto the TESS:\n\u2022 During periods with low prices: the heat pump stores\nthermal energy in the TESS, i.e. the thermal energy that heat\npump delivers to the TESS (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e,\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc43\n) is larger than the thermal\ndemand of the building (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e,\ud835\udc35\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc54\n).\n\u2022 During periods with high prices: the TESS discharges its\nstored thermal energy; therefore, the heat pump can consume\nless electricity and even stop working.\nIn other words, the TESS allows the heat pump to mainly\noperate in periods where the price of the electricity is low.\nTherefore, the TESS helps to minimize the operation cost of the\nsystem, i.e. the cost associated with purchasing electricity from\nthe grid (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc52,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51\n), over the whole defined time horizon. The\ndetailed model of the building\u2019s energy system is illustrated in\nFig. 2Fig. 2. The following sub-sections elaborate on the\nmodeling of each part of the building\u2019s energy system.\nB. The Building\u2019s Thermal Model\nThe BEMS, presented in this paper, leverages the building\u2019s\nthermal model to determine the evolution of the building\u2019s\nindoor air temperature over the time, thereby, ensuring the\nthermal comfort of the residents while optimally steering the\nbuilding\u2019s energy system. In this respect, this sub-section sets\nout to derive the thermal model of a typical building in time\ndomain. The main thermal interactions affecting on the\nbuilding\u2019s indoor air temperature, shown in Fig. 3, are:\n\u2022 heat input from solar radiation;\n\u2022 heating or cooling loads from fan coil;\n\u2022 heat transfer through the walls and windows;\n\u2022 internal heat gain corresponding to the activities of occupants\nsuch as metabolic heat, utilization of electrical devices, and\nthermal emission of artificial lighting.\nThis paper considers all elements located inside the building\nas a part of the building\u2019s internal thermal mass which is shown\nas a part of the floor in Fig. 3. Therefore, the building\u2019s indoor\nspace can be considered as two different thermal zones, i.e. the\n\n4\nSun\nHeat transfer\nbetween indoor and\noutdoor\nHeating or cooling load\nfrom fan coil\nHeat transfer between\nindoor air and building\nmaterials\nWindows\nBuilding\n \ns Internal Thermal Mass\nFig. 3 The simplified schematic of different thermal loads in a building\u2019s zone.\nair and the building\u2019s internal thermal mass. Then, the\nequivalent thermal-electrical model of the building is extracted\nas shown in Fig. 4. The privileged features of this model are:\n1-this model simply reflects the key thermal characteristics of\nthe building without increasing the complexity of the model,\nthereby, having low computational burden;\n2-this model can predict the system behavior under different\nconditions;\n3- this model is applicable for both short-term and long-term\nstudies where the variations of the building\u2019s indoor air\ntemperature under dynamic situations are investigated.\nThe main components of the building\u2019s thermal network and\nheat fluxes are shown in Fig. 4. This thermal network consists\nof 4 parts that are 1-outdoor environment, 2-building envelope\n(i.e. walls and windows), 3-indoor air, and 4-building\u2019s internal\nthermal mass. In this model, each node is described by its\ntemperature (T) and its thermal capacity (C). Additionally, the\nheat transfer between two nodes are modeled by thermal\nresistances (R) [27].\nThe heat transfer on the external wall arises from the\nconvective heat transfer with the outdoor ambient air, not to\nmention radiative heat transfer with the sky (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e,\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\n). The\nsolar radiation enters the building through the windows and its\naccompanied energy is transmitted to the indoor air (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e,\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc56\n)\nand the building\u2019s internal thermal mass (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e,\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\n). The\nbuilding\u2019s internal thermal mass is modeled by a thermal\nresistance (\ud835\udc45\n\ud835\udc56\n) and a thermal capacitance (\ud835\udc36\n\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a\n). The building\u2019s\nindoor air absorbs:\n1-some portion of the solar radiation entered the building\nthrough the windows (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e,\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f,\ud835\udc56\n);\n2-thermal loads of the equipment and occupants (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e,\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\n);\n3-thermal load of the fan coil (\ud835\udc43\n\ud835\udc61\u210e,\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc48\n).\nThe abovementioned thermal loads are transmitted to the\nbuilding\u2019s internal thermal mass through thermal resistance \ud835\udc45\n\ud835\udc56\nand accordingly stored in it. This stored thermal energy is\ngradually released to the building\u2019s indoor air in the next time\nintervals.

The PVT Collector\u2019s Thermal and Electrical Models\nPhotovoltaic-thermal (PVT) collectors are able to\nsimultaneously convert solar energy (accompanied with solar\nirradiation) into electrical and thermal energy as schematically\nrepresented in Fig. 5. In this context, this sub-section first\npresents the thermal and then the electrical model of the PVT\ncollector.\nThermal model of the PVT collector\nThe equivalent thermal-electrical model of the PVT collector\ncan be derived by considering 1-PV cell and 2-solar thermal\ncollector as nodes of the model. As shown in Fig. 6, the PVT\ncollector is modeled as a two-node thermal network whose two\nnodes are connected together via the internal thermal resistance\nof the PVT collector (\ud835\udc45\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc47\n).

HP consumes electric power to transfer thermal\nenergy from a source with a lower temperature to a sink with a\nhigher temperature, accordingly HP can be operated in cooling\nor heating modes based on the required thermal load of the\nbuilding. To enable the HP to maintain efficient operation under\ndiverse environment conditions, a PVT-air dual source heat\npump is used as shown in Fig. 8. This HP consists of a PVT\nevaporator and an air source evaporator connected in parallel\nthat operate simultaneously to recover thermal energy from\nboth solar energy and ambient air. In cases where the\n\n8\nevaporating capacity in PVT evaporator remains relatively low\nunder low solar irradiation, the air source evaporator can make\namends for recovering heat. In literatures, there was rarely\nreported about dual source HP with double evaporators that\nencompasses air and solar source evaporators simultaneously\n[40,41]. The HP is modeled relying on its specifications\npresented in the datasheet.

STOCHASTIC MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL (MPC)\nSTRATEGY\nA. Stochastic MPC framework and structure\nThis section constructs a stochastic MPC strategy to\noptimally steer the building\u2019s energy system over each\nindividual day. More specifically, the MPC strategy starts at the\nbeginning of the day and lasts until the end of the day, as\nillustrated in Fig. 9. Accordingly, the time horizon of the MPC\nproblem (H) is 24 hours of the day which embraces two time\nperiods:\n\u2022 Time slot (T): The whole 24-hour of the day is split into 48\ntime slots with duration T = 30 minutes and k =1, 2, \u2026, 48\nindicates the rolling index for time slots over the day of\n1 \nConsidering the timeline of the problem depicted in Fig. 9, \ud835\udf05 = 30\ud835\udc58.\nTime Slot 1\nTime\nTime Horizon: H = 24 hours\n0\nTime slot t\nT\n\ud835\udc61\n \nT\nH\nTime Slot 2\nAt the beginning of each time\n \nslot\n \n(\n\ud835\udc47\n),\n \nthe\n \nstochastic MPC strategy\n \n(\ndefined\ni\nn section III) is solved\n.

The MPC problem models the trajectory of solar\nirradiation (\ud835\udc3a) with time resolution of \ud835\udf0f = 1 minutes to better\ncapture the high frequency temporal variations of the solar\nirradiation. However, the outdoor ambient air temperature\n(\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f\n) and electricity price (\ud835\udf0b\n\ud835\udc52,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51\n) have moderate temporal\nvariations, thus, their temporal variations are modeled with\ntime resolution of T = 30 minutes.\nThe outline of the MPC strategy can be elaborated\nconsidering the situations at the beginning of time slot k:\n1) The most recent realized outdoor ambient air\ntemperature (\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f\n[k\u22121]), building\u2019s indoor air\ntemperature (\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\n[k\u22121]) and solar irradiation (\ud835\udc3a[\ud835\udf05 \u2212 1])\nare measured.\n2) the outdoor ambient air temperature (\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f\n[k],\n\ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f\n[k+1], \u2026, \ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4f\n[48]) and electricity price\n(\ud835\udf0b\n\ud835\udc52,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51\n[k], \ud835\udf0b\n\ud835\udc52,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51\n[k+1], \u2026, \ud835\udf0b\n\ud835\udc52,\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51\n[48]) over upcoming\ntime slots (k, k +1,\u2026, 48) are predicated with time\nresolution of T = 30 minutes.\n3) the solar irradiation (\ud835\udc3a[\ud835\udf05], \ud835\udc3a[\ud835\udf05 + 1], \u2026, \ud835\udc3a[1440]) over\nupcoming sub-slots (\ud835\udf05, \ud835\udf05 + 1, \u2026, 1440) is predicted\nwith time resolution of \ud835\udf0f = 1 minute\n1\n.

Prediction model\nDue to the volatility of the meteorological conditions, the\npredicted solar irradiation might differ from the one that realize\nduring the real-time operation of the building. The difference\nbetween the predicted value and the realized value is called\nprediction error or uncertainty. Considering the fact that the\nsolar irradiation features high frequency variations, the method\nmodels the solar irradiation through a set of scenarios, i.e. \ud835\udd4a, to\naccount for the prediction errors. Moreover, it models each\nscenario with time resolution of 1-minute to better capture the\ntemporal variations of the solar irradiation over each time slot.\nThis 1-minute duration is called sub-slot as shown in Fig. 9.\nAccordingly, the uncertainty-cognizant MPC strategy is able to\nbetter ensure the thermal comfort of the residents in comparison\n\n10\nTable 1.

The internal heat load of examined building.\nwith common MPC strategies that generally model the solar\nirradiation with a single scenario (i.e. point prediction) and\nlong-time resolutions range between 30-minute to 1-hour. To\nmodel the set of scenarios \ud835\udd4a, the paper relies on a Training\nData Set consisting of a series of historical measured solar\nirradiation (G\nT \n(w/m\n2\n)) over the last 10 years with time\nresolution of 1 minute. Then, a machine learning based\napproach, i.e. k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm [42], is\nexploited to generate 100 scenarios modeling the solar\nirradiation over the upcoming sub-slots (\ud835\udf05, \ud835\udf05 + 1, \u2026, 1440).\nConsidering the fact that the ambient temperature has a very\nmoderate variation over time, this method only accounts for the\npoint prediction of the ambient temperature over the upcoming\ntime slots and it does not account for the prediction error of the\nambient temperature. Moreover, this method models the\nambient temperature with time resolution equal to the duration\nof a time slot, i.e. 30 minutes. In this respect, this paper relies\non a Training Data Set consisting of a series of historical\nmeasured ambient temperature over the last 10 years with time\nresolution of 15 minutes. It is worth highlighting that this data\nset has been received from Iran Meteorological Organization\n(IMO).

The\nprofiles of all these terms over 24 hours of study are shown in\nFig. 12.\nThe building\u2019s energy system is formed of 1-a PVT-air dual\nsource heat pump with R-32 refrigerant, 2-a 2000-liter water\nstorage tank with a height-over-diameter ratio of 4 as a TESS,\n3-a water-based covered photovoltaic thermal (PVT) collector\nwith front glazing, rear collector cover and no thermal\ninsulation material on the back of the PVT absorber, 4-\ncirculation pumps and 5-FCUs. The performance coefficients\nof the PVT collector are reported in Table 2 [31,32].\nConsidering the fact that the hourly electricity prices are\ndetermined in the day-ahead electricity market (a day prior to\nreal-time operation), this study assumes that the hourly\nelectricity prices are known/given. More specifically, the\nhourly electricity prices are extracted from the published data\nby Iran Electricity Market (IEMA). The profile of the hourly\nelectricity prices over 24 hours of the study, i.e. 10 January\n2021, is shown in Fig. 13.\nAll prediction and simulations are carried out using\nMATLAB. Moreover, the stochastic MPC optimization\nproblem is modeled by using YALMIP-MATLAB and solved\n\n11\nwith GUROBI solver on a Windows based system with a AMD\nRyzen 5 3500U CPU and 16 GB RAM.\nV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Simulation results associated with uncertainty-cognizant\nMPC strategy (Controller 1)\nThis section presents the performance of the constructed\nuncertainty-cognizant MPC strategy for managing the building\nenergy system over a typical winter day. At the beginning of\neach time slot, the solar irradiation and ambient air temperature\nare firstly predicted following the method presented in section\nIII.C. Fig. 14 depicts all 100 scenarios modeling the solar\nirradiation (over the upcoming sub-slots) along with the\nrealized solar irradiation over the 24 hours of the study.\nMoreover, the point prediction of the solar irradiation is\ncalculated so that fifteen percent of scenarios are above it and\nthe 50 percent of scenarios are below it, i.e. quantile 50%. Fig.\n15 illustrates the predicted ambient air temperature along with\nthe realized one. Considering the predicted solar irradiation as\nwell as ambient temperature along with the model developed in\nsection II.C, the thermal and electric power generation of the\nPVT collector can be easily calculated (predicted) as shown in\nFig. 16. Finally, the stochastic MPC strategy presented in\nsection III are actuated at the beginning of each time slot to\noptimally steer the building\u2019s energy system. Accordingly, the\noptimal operating points of the HP and FCU are determined.\nFig. 17 and Fig. 18 respectively show the HP and FCU\noperating points (i.e. off/on state) along with their output\nthermal power. Fig. 19 illustrates the evolution of the building\u2019s\nindoor air temperature and TESS water temperature over the\nwhole day. As it can be seen, the method manages to keep the\nindoor air temperature and TESS water temperature within their\ndesired ranges, thereby, preserving the thermal comfort of the\nresidents. Moreover, from 00:00 to 06:00 where the electricity\nprice is low, the method repeatedly turns on the HP and FCU to\nstore thermal energy in the thermal capacities of the TESS and\nbuilding (i.e. increases the TESS water temperature and keep\nthe indoor air temperature higher than the minimum acceptable\nindoor air temperature). To better discover the capability of the\nmethod in optimally steering the building\u2019s energy system, Fig.\n20 shows the net electric power that the building exchanged\nwith the grid over 24 hours of study. In Fig. 20, positive values\nmean that the building absorbed (i.e. purchased) electricity\nfrom the grid, while the negative values mean that the building\ninjected (i.e. sold) electricity to the grid. As it can be seen, the\nmethod leverages the thermal capacities of the TESS and\nbuilding to shift the building\u2019s electricity consumption from the\nperiods with high prices to periods with low prices, thereby,\ndecreasing the operating cost of the building\u2019s energy system.\nMore specifically, the method turns on the HP during periods\nwith low prices, thereby, storing thermal energy in the TESS.\nThen, during periods with high prices (9:00 am and 3:00 pm),\nthe method turns off the HP and discharges the TESS. In this\nway, the building is empowered to sell electricity to the grid\nduring periods with high prices and consume electricity mainly\nduring periods with low prices.\nThe building\u2019s net purchased electricity over the whole day\nFig. 14.

Simulation results associated with thermostatic controller\n(Controller 2)\nThis section aims to better unfold the advantages of the\nconstructed uncertainty-cognizant MPC strategy (Controller 1)\nby comparing its performance with the thermostatic controllers\n(Controller 2) that are widely used to manage the building\u2019s\nenergy system. To this end, it is assumed that two thermostatic\ncontrollers (Controller 2) are used to manage the building\u2019s\nenergy system, i.e. FCU and HP. These thermostatic controllers\n(Controller 2) can allow the residents to only determine a single\nset-point for the indoor air temperature, i.e. \ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\n, and\nTESS water temperature, i.e. \ud835\udc47\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc61\u2212\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61\n, instead of allowing the\nresidents to determine a range for the indoor air temperature and\nTESS water temperature.

Fig. 23\nillustrates the evolution of the building\u2019s indoor air temperature\nand TESS water temperature over the whole day.

As it can be seen, the thermostatic\ncontroller (i.e. Controller 2) never can shift the building\u2019s\nelectricity consumption from the periods with high prices to\nperiods with low prices because:\n1- the thermostatic controller solely relies on the real-time\nmeasurements,\n2- the thermostatic controller is not able to take advantage\nfrom the prediction of solar irradiation and ambient air\ntemperature, thereby, cannot take advantage from the\nthermal capacities of the TESS.\nTo put it simply, the thermostatic controller (i.e. Controller\n2) cannot decrease the operating cost of the building\u2019s energy\nsystem.\nRelying on the thermostatic controller (i.e. Controller 2), the\nbuilding\u2019s net purchased electricity over the whole day is 239\nkWh (i.e. equal to the area under the curve shown in Fig. 24).\nConsidering the variable electricity price over the day, the\nbuilding\u2019s electricity cost over the whole day is 1,215 cents.\nTo better unfold the advantage of controller 1, Table 3\nsummaries the performance of the uncertainty-cognizant MPC\nstrategy (i.e. Controller 1) and thermostatic controller (i.e.\nController 2). This table reveals that controller 1 results in 31%\nless electric power consumption and 81% electricity cost saving\nin comparison with controller 2. It is worth highlighting that\ncontroller 1 achieved a much better performance due to 1-taking\nadvantage from the thermal capacities of the TESS and the\nbuilding 2-accounting for the temporal variation of the\nelectricity price, solar irradiation and ambient temperature over\nthe upcoming time-slots.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper advocates for the employment of uncertainty-\ncognizant model predictive control (MPC) strategy for\noptimally operating smart buildings equipped with grid-\nconnected photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) collectors, heat pump\n(HP) system, thermal energy storage system (TESS) and fan\ncoil unit (FCU). In this context, it constructed a stochastic MPC\nstrategy to maximize the building\u2019s self-consumption and\nconsequently minimize building\u2019s electricity cost while\nconsidering the temporal variations of the electricity price (i.e.\ntime-of-use (TOU) tariff), renewable energy resources (RES)\ngeneration, and outdoor ambient air temperature over the whole\nday. More specifically, the presented method minimizes the\nbuilding\u2019s electric power consumption (and more importantly\nthe building\u2019s electricity cost) while preserving the thermal\ncomfort of the residents. The uncertainties associated with RES\nwere also modeled by k-NN algorithm through defining a set of\nscenarios to strengthen the modeling the RES power generation.\nA single-family residential building is used to validate the\nperformance of the proposed method. The achieved results\nshow that the proposed stochastic MPC significantly decreases\nthe building\u2019s total electricity consumption about 75 kWh\n(31%) resulting in 991 cent (81%) energy cost saving by\nshifting the HP and FCU loads while keeping the indoor\ntemperature within its allowable temperature range. It is of\ngreat importance to note that the proposed method takes the\nadvantage of the thermal energy storage capacity to shift the\nbuilding\u2019s energy consumption from peak to off-peak hours,\nthereby, reducing the building\u2019s electricity cost over the whole\nday.\n\n14\nREFERENCES\n[1] Omer, A.M., 2008.

The suspended nanoparticles can enhance the thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficient of the fluid. This can potentially improve the overall efficiency of the PVT collector.\n\n- Spectrally selective coatings on the absorber plate: Some recent studies have worked on using spectrally selective coatings on the absorber plate of PVT collectors. These coatings have higher absorptivity in the visible range for PV operation and higher reflectivity in the infrared range to reduce thermal emission losses. This can help improve the electrical and thermal efficiency of the PVT collector.\n\n- Hybrid PVT designs with concentrators: Concentrators like compound parabolic concentrators are being used along with PVT collectors. The concentrators focus more solar radiation onto the PV cells to boost electricity generation, while the thermal energy is captured from the heated absorber plate. This hybrid design can improve the overall utilization of the solar spectrum.\n\n- Heat pipe based PVT collectors: Heat pipes integrated with the PVT absorber plate can help improve heat removal and thermal efficiency. The evaporator section of the heat pipe is bonded to the absorber plate while the condensed heat is transferred to the heat transfer fluid. This allows better thermal management.\n\n- Use of glazed and unglazed PVT collectors: Glazed PVT collectors with a glass cover reduce convection losses but increase cost. Unglazed PVT collectors without a cover are cheaper but lose more heat to the ambient. Tradeoffs between glazed and unglazed PVTs are being explored.\n\nIn summary, recent PVT developments have focused on advanced materials, optical enhancements, heat transfer improvements and design optimizations to improve the overall conversion efficiency and performance.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-02-04T11:25:51.410086Z", "updated_at": "2024-02-04T11:25:51.410086Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "a40789d2-2114-4197-84a7-21d1b21c9429", "text": "Please translate that response into italian", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-02-04T11:27:08.309455Z", "updated_at": "2024-02-04T11:27:08.309455Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "d7384726-4fc9-4b99-8b0b-4b00f8b5c82b", "text": " Ecco una traduzione in italiano della mia risposta precedente relativa agli sviluppi recenti dei collettori solari ibridi fotovoltaici termici discussi nell'articolo:\n\n- Uso di nanofluidi come fluido termovettore: l'articolo menziona che studi recenti hanno esplorato l'uso di nanofluidi come fluido termovettore nei collettori PVT invece che l'acqua. Le nanoparticelle sospese possono migliorare la conducibilit\u00e0 termica e il coefficiente di scambio termico del fluido. Questo pu\u00f2 potenzialmente migliorare l'efficienza complessiva del collettore PVT. \n\n- Rivestimenti spettralmente selettivi sulla piastra assorbitrice: alcuni studi recenti hanno lavorato su rivestimenti spettralmente selettivi sulla piastra assorbitrice dei collettori PVT. Questi rivestimenti hanno una maggiore assorbanza nella banda visibile per il funzionamento fotovoltaico e una maggiore riflettivit\u00e0 nella banda infrarossa per ridurre le perdite di emissione termica.

I concentratotori concentrano pi\u00f9 radiazione solare sulle celle fotovoltaiche per aumentare la produzione di elettricit\u00e0, mentre l'energia termica viene catturata dalla piastra assorbitrice riscaldata. Questo design ibrido pu\u00f2 migliorare l'utilizzo complessivo dello spettro solare. \n\n- Collettori PVT a tubi heat-pipe: i tubi heat-pipe integrati con la piastra assorbitrice PVT possono aiutare a migliorare la rimozione del calore e l'efficienza termica. La sezione evaporatrice del tubo heat-pipe \u00e8 legata alla piastra assorbitrice mentre il calore condensato viene trasferito al fluido termovettore. Ci\u00f2 consente una migliore gestione termica.\n\n- Uso di collettori PVT vetrati e non vetrati: i collettori PVT vetrati con una copertura in vetro riducono le perdite per convezione ma aumentano i costi. I collettori PVT non vetrati senza copertura sono pi\u00f9 economici ma perdono pi\u00f9 calore nell'ambiente circostante. Si stanno esplorando varie soluzioni tra PVT vetrati e non vetrati. \n\nIn sintesi, gli sviluppi recenti dei PVT si sono concentrati su materiali avanzati, miglioramenti ottici, miglioramenti del trasferimento di calore e ottimizzazioni di progettazione per migliorare l'efficienza di conversione complessiva e le prestazioni.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-02-04T11:27:08.309455Z", "updated_at": "2024-02-04T11:27:08.309455Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "5df3a209-6455-45ed-9e72-b28dc86ed834", "name": "The Sociology of Misinformation: Outlining a Research Agenda", "created_at": "2023-11-14T20:20:12.763943Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-14T20:44:58.283842Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "92fe1a32-122e-442e-ab41-4ce31dfe44ce", "text": "    Act as an academic research expert.

Concern over the\nproblem is global. However, little is\nknown regarding fundamental issues\nabout the vulnerabilities of individuals, in-\nstitutions, and society to manipulations by\nmalicious actors. Below we discuss extant\nsocial and computer science research regard-\ning belief in fake news and the mechanisms\nby which it spreads. We focus on unanswered\nscientific questions raised by the prolifera-\ntion of its most recent, politically oriented in-\ncarnation. Beyond selected references in the\ntext, suggested further reading can be found\nin the supplementary materials.\nWHAT IS FAKE NEWS?\nWe define \u201cfake news\u201d to be fabricated in-\nformation that mimics news media content\nin form but not in organizational process or\nintent. Fake news outlets, in turn, lack the\nnews media\u2019s editorial norms and processes\nfor ensuring the accuracy and credibility of\ninformation. Fake news overlaps with other\ninformation disorders, such as misinforma-\ntion (false or misleading information) and\ndisinformation (false information that is pur-\nposely spread to deceive people).\nFake news has primarily drawn recent at-\ntention in a political context, but it also has\nbeen documented in information promul-\ngated about topics such as vaccination, nu-\ntrition, and stock values. It is particularly\npernicious in that it is parasitic on standard\nnews outlets, simultaneously benefiting from\nand undermining their credibility.\nOur definition of fake news makes no\nassumptions about the characteristics of\nsources or amplification strategies. Some\u2014\nnotably First Draft and Facebook favor \u201cfalse\nnews\u201d because of the use of fake news as a\npolitical weapon (1). We have retained it be-\ncause of its value as a scientific construct, and\nbecause its political salience draws attention\nto an important subject.\nTHE HISTORICAL SETTING\nJournalistic norms of objectivity and balance\narose as a backlash among journalists against\nthe widespread use of propaganda in World\nWar I (particularly their own role in propa-\ngating it) and the rise of corporate public\nrelations in the 1920s. Local and national oli-\ngopolies created by the dominant 20th cen-\ntury technologies of information distribution\n(print and broadcast) sustained these norms.\nThe internet has reduced many of those con-\nstraints on news dissemination. This allows\noutlets that do not embody these norms to\ncompete online with those that do so more ef-\nfectively than was possible offline. It has con-\ntributed to the abandonment of traditional\nnews sources that had enjoyed high levels of\npublic trust and credibility. General trust in\nSOCIAL SCIENCE\nThe science of fake news\nAddressing fake news requires a multidisciplinary effort\nINSIGHTS\nP OLICY FORUM\nThe list of author affiliations is provided in the supplementary\nmaterials.

Homoge-\nneous social networks, in turn, reduce toler-\nance for alternative views, amplify attitudinal\npolarization, boost the likelihood of accepting\nideologically compatible news, and increase\nclosure to new information. Dislike of the\n\u201cother side\u201d (affective polarization) has also\nrisen. These trends have created a context in\nwhich fake news can attract a mass audience.\nPREVALENCE AND IMPACT\nHow common is fake news, and what is its\nimpact on individuals? Solutions should be\ncommensurate to the magnitude of the prob-\nlem, but there are surprisingly few scientific\nanswers to these basic questions.\nIn evaluating the fake news prevalence, we\nadvocate focusing on the original sources\u2014\nthe publishers\u2014rather than individual sto-\nries, because we view the defining element of\nfake news to be the intent and processes of\nthe publisher. A focus on publishers also al-\nlows us to avoid the morass of trying to evalu-\nate the accuracy of every single news story.\nOne study evaluating the dissemination of\nprominent fake news stories estimated that\nthe average American encountered between\none and three stories from known publish-\ners of fake news during the month before\nthe 2016 election (3). This likely is a conser-\nvative estimate because the study tracked\nonly 156 fake news stories. Another study\nreported that false information on Twitter\nis typically retweeted by many more people,\nand far more rapidly, than true informa-\ntion, especially when the topic is politics (4).\nFacebook has estimated that manipulations\nby malicious actors accounted for less than\none-tenth of 1% of civic content shared on the\nplatform (5), although it has not presented\ndetails of its analysis.\nBy liking, sharing, and searching for infor-\nmation, social bots (automated accounts im-\npersonating humans) can magnify the spread\nof fake news by orders of magnitude. By one\nrecent estimate\u2014that classified accounts\nbased on observable features such as shar-\ning behavior, number of ties, and linguistic\nfeatures\u2014between 9 and 15% of active Twit-\nter accounts are bots (6). Facebook estimated\nthat as many as 60 million bots (7) may be\ninfesting its platform. They were responsible\nfor a substantial portion of political content\nposted during the 2016 U.S. campaign, and\nsome of the same bots were later used to at-\ntempt to influence the 2017 French election\n(8). Bots are also deployed to manipulate al-\ngorithms used to predict potential engage-\nment with content by a wider population.\nIndeed, a Facebook white paper reports wide-\nspread efforts to carry out this sort of manip-\nulation during the 2016 U.S. election (5).\nHowever, in the absence of methods to\nderive representative samples of bots and\nhumans on a given platform, any point esti-\nmates of bot prevalence must be interpreted\ncautiously. Bot detection will always be a\ncat-and-mouse game in which a large, but\nunknown, number of humanlike bots may go\nundetected. Any success at detection, in turn,\nwill inspire future countermeasures by bot\nproducers. Identification of bots will there-\nfore be a major ongoing research challenge.\nWe do know that, as with legitimate news,\nfake news stories have gone viral on social\nmedia. However, knowing how many indi-\nviduals encountered or shared a piece of fake\nnews is not the same as knowing how many\npeople read or were affected by it. Evaluating\nmedium-to-long\u2013run impact on political be-\nhavior of exposure to fake news (for example,\nwhether and how to vote) is essentially non-\nexistent in the literature. The impact might\nbe small\u2014evidence suggests that efforts by\npolitical campaigns to persuade individuals\nmay have limited effects (9). However, me-\ndiation of much fake news via social media\nmight accentuate its effect because of the\nimplicit endorsement that comes with shar-\ning. Beyond electoral impacts, what we know\nabout the effects of media more generally\nsuggests many potential pathways of influ-\nence, from increasing cynicism and apathy\nto encouraging extremism. There exists little\nevaluation of the impacts of fake news in\nthese regards.\nPOTENTIAL INTERVENTIONS\nWhat interventions might be effective at\nstemming the flow and influence of fake\nnews? We identify two categories of inter-\nventions: (i) those aimed at empowering\nindividuals to evaluate the fake news they\nencounter, and (ii) structural changes aimed\nat preventing exposure of individuals to fake\nnews in the first instance.\nEmpowering individuals\nThere are many forms of fact checking, from\nwebsites that evaluate factual claims of news\nreports, such as PolitiFact and Snopes, to\nevaluations of news reports by credible news\nmedia, such as the Washington Post, to con-\ntextual information regarding content in-\nserted by intermediaries, such as those used\nby Facebook.\nDespite the apparent elegance of fact\nchecking, science supporting its efficacy is, at\nbest, mixed. This may reflect broader tenden-\ncies in collective cognition, as well as struc-\ntural changes in our society. Individuals tend\nnot to question the credibility of information\nunless it violates their preconceptions or they\nare incentivized to do so. Otherwise, they\nmay accept information uncritically. People\nalso tend to align their beliefs with the values\nof their community.\nResearch also further demonstrates that\npeople prefer information that confirms\ntheir preexisting attitudes (selective expo-\nsure), view information consistent with their\npreexisting beliefs as more persuasive than\ndissonant information (confirmation bias),\nand are inclined to accept information that\npleases them (desirability bias). Prior parti-\nsan and ideological beliefs might prevent ac-\nceptance of fact checking of a given fake news\nstory.\nFact checking might even be counterpro-\nductive under certain circumstances. Re-\nsearch on fluency\u2014the ease of information\nrecall\u2014and familiarity bias in politics shows\nthat people tend to remember information,\nor how they feel about it, while forgetting the\ncontext within which they encountered it.\nMoreover, they are more likely to accept fa-\nmiliar information as true (10). There is thus\na risk that repeating false information, even\nin a fact-checking context, may increase an\nindividual\u2019s likelihood of accepting it as true.\nThere is mixed evidence about effectiveness\nof claim repetition in fact checking (11).\nAlthough experimental and survey re-\nsearch have confirmed that the perception of\ntruth increases when misinformation is re-\npeated, this may not occur if the misinforma-\ntion is paired with a valid retraction. Some\nresearch suggests that repetition of the mis-\ninformation before its correction may even\nbe beneficial. Further research is needed to\nreconcile these contradictions and determine\nthe conditions under which fact-checking in-\nterventions are most effective.\nAnother longer-run approach seeks to\nimprove individual evaluation of the quality\nof information sources through education.\nThere has been a proliferation of efforts to\ninject training of critical-information skills\nin primary and secondary schools (12). How-\never, it is uncertain whether such efforts im-\nprove assessments of information credibility\nor if any such effects will persist over time. An\nemphasis on fake news might also have the\nunintended consequence of reducing the per-\nceived credibility of real-news outlets. There\nis a great need for rigorous program evalu-\nation of different educational interventions.\nPlatform-based detection and intervention:\nAlgorithms and bots\nInternet platforms have become the most\nimportant enablers and primary conduits of\n8 MARCH 2018 \u2022 VOL 359 ISSUE 6380 3\n\nsciencemag.org SCIENCE\nINSIGHTS \n| \nPOLICY F ORUM\nfake news. It is inexpensive to create a web-\nsite that has the trappings of a professional\nnews organization. It has also been easy to\nmonetize content through online ads and\nsocial media dissemination. The internet\nnot only provides a medium for publishing\nfake news but offers tools to actively promote\ndissemination.\nAbout 47% of Americans overall report get-\nting news from social media often or some-\ntimes, with Facebook as, by far, the dominant\nsource (13). Social media are key conduits for\nfake news sites (3). Indeed, Russia success-\nfully manipulated all of the major platforms\nduring the 2016 U.S. election, according to\nrecent testimony (7).\nHow might the internet and social media\nplatforms help reduce the spread and impact\nof fake news? Google, Facebook, and Twitter\nare often mediators not only of our relation-\nship with the news media but also with our\nfriends and relatives. Generally, their busi-\nness model relies on monetizing attention\nthrough advertising. They use complex statis-\ntical models to predict and maximize engage-\nment with content (14). It should be possible\nto adjust those models to increase emphasis\non quality information.\nPlatforms could provide con-\nsumers with signals of source\nquality that could be incorpo-\nrated into the algorithmic rank-\nings of content. They could\nminimize the personalization of\npolitical information relative to\nother types of content (reducing\nthe creation of \u201cecho chambers\u201d).\nFunctions that emphasize cur-\nrently trending content could seek to exclude\nbot activity from measures of what is trend-\ning. More generally, platforms could curb the\nautomated spread of news content by bots\nand cyborgs (users who automatically share\nnews from a set of sources, with or without\nreading them), although for the foreseeable\nfuture, bot producers will likely be able to de-\nsign effective countermeasures.\nThe platforms have attempted each of\nthese steps and others (5, 15). Facebook an-\nnounced an intent to shift its algorithm to\naccount for \u201cquality\u201d in its content curation\nprocess. Twitter announced that it blocked\ncertain accounts linked to Russian misinfor-\nmation and informed users exposed to those\naccounts that they may have been duped.\nHowever, the platforms have not provided\nenough detail for evaluation by the research\ncommunity or subjected their findings to\npeer review, making them problematic for\nuse by policy-makers or the general public.\nWe urge platforms to collaborate with\nindependent academics on evaluating the\nscope of the fake news issue and the design\nand effectiveness of interventions. There is\nlittle research focused on fake news and no\ncomprehensive data-collection system to\nprovide a dynamic understanding of how\npervasive systems of fake news provision\nare evolving. It is impossible to recreate the\nGoogle of 2010. Google could not do so even\nif it had the underlying code, because the\npatterns emerge from a complex interaction\namong code, content, and users. However, it\nis possible to record what the Google of 2018\nis doing. More generally, researchers need to\nconduct a rigorous, ongoing audit of how the\nmajor platforms filter information.\nThere are challenges to scientific collabo-\nration from the perspectives of industry and\nacademia. Yet, there is an ethical and social\nresponsibility, transcending market forces,\nfor the platforms to contribute what data\nthey uniquely can to a science of fake news.\nPossible effectiveness of platform-based\npolicies suggests either self-regulation by the\nplatforms or government intervention. Direct\ngovernment regulation of an area as sensitive\nas news carries its own risks, constitutional\nand otherwise. For instance, could govern-\nment regulators maintain (and, as important,\nbe seen as maintaining) impartiality in defin-\ning, imposing, and enforcing any\nrequirements? Generally, any di-\nrect intervention by government\nor the platforms that prevents\nusers from seeing content raises\nconcerns about either govern-\nment or corporate censorship.\nAn alternative to direct gov-\nernment regulation would be to\nenable tort lawsuits alleging, for\nexample, defamation by those di-\nrectly and concretely harmed by the spread\nof fake news. To the extent that an online\nplatform assisted in the spreading of a mani-\nfestly false (but still persuasive) story, there\nmight be avenues for liability consistent with\nexisting constitutional law, which, in turn,\nwould pressure platforms to intervene more\nregularly. In the U.S. context, however, a pro-\nvision of the 1996 Communications Decency\nAct offers near-comprehensive immunity to\nplatforms for false or otherwise actionable\nstatements penned by others. Any change to\nthis legal regime would raise thorny issues\nabout the extent to which platform content\n(and content-curation decisions) should be\nsubject to second guessing by people alleging\ninjury. The European \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d\nin search engines is testing these issues.\nStructural interventions generally raise\nlegitimate concerns about respecting private\nenterprise and human agency. But just as the\nmedia companies of the 20th century shaped\nthe information to which individuals were\nexposed, the far-more-vast internet oligopo-\nlies are already shaping human experience\non a global scale. The questions before us are\nhow those immense powers are being\u2014and\nshould be\u2014exercised and how to hold these\nmassive companies to account.\nA FUTURE AGENDA\nOur call is to promote interdisciplinary re-\nsearch to reduce the spread of fake news\nand to address the underlying pathologies\nit has revealed. Failures of the U.S. news me-\ndia in the early 20th century led to the rise\nof journalistic norms and practices that, al-\nthough imperfect, generally served us well by\nstriving to provide objective, credible infor-\nmation. We must redesign our information\necosystem in the 21st century. This must be\nglobal in scope, as many countries, some of\nwhich have never developed a robust news\necosystem, face challenges around fake and\nreal news that are more acute than in the\nUnited States. More broadly, we must answer\na fundamental question: How can we create\na news ecosystem and culture that values and\npromotes truth? j\nREFERENCES AND NOTES\n1. C. Wardle, H.

The contemporary\nfake news phenomenon is approached as an emergent outcome of inter-related\ntechnological, economic, socio-cultural and political factors that have made\nsociety vulnerable to misinformation. Those factors are understood as generators\nof various social dynamics rather than as direct causal determinants. In order\nto better acknowledge the conditions under which fake news is propagated and\nlegitimated in digital society, news should be approached not only as a commodity\nthat functions in a market-driven economy, but also as a social institution that\nregulates political discourse and public debate. Based on these considerations,\nthe conclusions support the necessity of a more prominent sociological focus on\nmedia studies, which could build awareness of the performative role of language\nin the context of technologically mediated realities.\nKeywords: fake news; misinformation; propaganda; attention economy.\nIntroduction\nMisinformation is an important issue on the public agenda. Studies show that\nthe circulation of misleading information on social media played an important role\nboth in the 2016 United States presidential election and in the Brexit referendum\n(Bastos, & Mercea, 2017; Fourney et al., 2017). Many countries are facing similar\nissues in terms of misinformation as a means of propaganda (Khaldarova, & Pantti,\n2016; Wasserman, 2020). False stories and deceptive reports are employed by\nvarious interest groups to increase their image capital and gain social or political\ninfluence. Therefore, fake news has a significant impact on democratic processes\nby influencing citizens\u2019 capacity to act responsibly based on informed decisions.\n1 \nNational University of Political Science and Public Administration & Association\nfor Social Entrepreneurship \u201cPlus One\u201d, Bucharest, ROMANIA. E-mail:\ntomagabriel2003@gmail.com.\n\n135\nThe phenomenon of fake news is linked to various forms of social polarisation\nthat spread extremist attitudes and generate latent conflicts between groups with\nantagonistic ideologies (Spohr, 2017). In this context, the phenomenon of fake\nnews threatens social stability and negatively affects the prestige of the journalism\nprofession.\nThis paper proposes some directions for analysing fake news from a sociological\nperspective that could complement and strengthen media studies by contributing\nto an enhanced understanding of how misinformation ecosystems emerge in\ncurrent digital worlds. Various sociological approaches might be employed to\nsystematically address the problem of misinformation and formulate explanations\nof why fake news is a reality today and how it comes to play important social and\npolitical roles. After justifying the relevance of a conceptualization of fake news\nas a social phenomenon, we propose some tracks to analyse fake news through the\nsociological lens by focusing on different sociological branches: (1) sociology of\ninfluence and persuasion, (2) sociology of journalistic practice and media industry,\n(3) sociology of online communities and digitally-mediated worlds, (4) sociology\nof culture and discourse, and (5) social psychology.\nFake news as a social phenomenon\nNews as a genre is an institutionalised form of communication that operates\naccording to rigid stylistic and rhetorical conventions (Miller, 1984). News is an\nobject with symbolic authority and integrates clear norms about what is being\ncommunicated and how it is communicated. Therefore, the relationship between\nnews producers and a public is based on norms of relevance and trustworthiness.\nThese norms are collectively acknowledged and are sometimes taken for granted\nin news consumption practices. In general, news represents a mediator between\nhumans and their social environment. By signalling what is important in the world,\nnews delivers a definition of the world and provides people with interpretative\nrepertoires to make sense of specific social realities. Consequently, news shapes\nthe knowledge of the world in powerful ways.\nThe media of information have undergone multiple transformations related\nto the digital revolution (Meltzer, 2009). Foremost among these is the fact that\nfake news emerged as a particular subgenre. As understood in the present paper,\nfake news represents content that resembles the style, form and rhetoric of news\nas a form of institutionalised communication but is detached from the norms and\nconventions that approach reliable information as a collective good. Fake news\nis very difficult to differentiate from factual news due to several reasons. On one\nhand, people are not always able to verify the accuracy of the content. On the other\nhand, the evidence itself can be manipulated. Furthermore, the boundaries between\nfake and accurate news are difficult to draw, since both forms of communication\ncirculate within the same channels and are based on similar consumption and\nSTUDII\n\nSOCIOLOGIE ROM\u00c2NEASC\u0102 - VOLUMUL 19(1)/2021\n136\ndistribution practices (Fernandez, 2017): fake news uses the social legitimacy of\nfactual news to influence public opinion.\nThis paper discusses fake news as a social phenomenon. Fake news can be\nconsidered a social phenomenon from several perspectives. First, fake news\nis widespread across social and cultural contexts, with digital technologies\ncontributing to the rapid dissemination of misleading content in a public space.\nSecondly, fake news has impact on social order: misleading information influences\nvoting behaviour, causes social movements, imposes issues on the political agenda,\nchanges public perception and ultimately changes reality. Thirdly, fake news is a\ncollective accomplishment: fake news results from various collective processes\nand practices, including not only the production of false stories but also their\ndistribution and consumption and people\u2019s receptivity to the stories. Fake news is\nco-produced between news producers, news media and the audience that performs\nan act of authentication. Without people believing deceptive content, fake news\nwould remain a work of fiction (Marchi, 2012; Tandoc et al., 2017). The individual\u2019s\nbehaviour alone cannot enhance the impact of fake news, but the coordinated\nactions and technological affordances that enable the spread of misinformation do.\nFake news is influential because people rely on it to orient themselves in the world.\nFourthly, fake news emerges through joint actions that work upon knowledge\nstructures and social experiences. From this perspective, fake news is a social\nfact (Durkheim, 1982) because it exerts constraining influences on individuals\u2019\nexperience of the world.\nSociology of influence and persuasion\nRevisiting classical theories of media influence\nThe number of publishing platforms has grown, and the news ecosystem has\nundergone significant transformations. One of these is related to the development\nof alternative sources of information that are outside the control of conventional\ngatekeepers as social actors meant to safeguard the credibility and quality of\ncontent (Bro, & Wallberg, 2014). The internet enables numerous content providers\nto enter the online news landscape. Since content production and marketing costs\nare affordable, users can reach a mass audience and influence targeted groups\n(Tandoc Jr. et al., 2018). In particular, the virtue of the online space lies in its\nform of organisation based on principles of accessibility, equality and pluralism.\nNamely, the internet allows laypersons to participate in the production of content,\ninform a general public and spread their views at little cost (Coleman, 2017). The\nonline environment is socio-technically organised to allow virtually everyone to\nproduce and distribute digital media content. Despite the numerous opportunities\nfor civic activism and mass mobilisation, the ease of information creation and\ndistribution in the online environment poses great challenges for the quality of\n\n137\nSTUDII\nthe online news industry, an industry that has become vulnerable to fake news as\na means of propaganda and manipulation.\nWhile substitute forms of gate keeping practices emerged in the digital sphere,\nthe legacy media started being criticised for allowing the editors\u2019 ideological biases\nand commercial interests to influence decisions about which issues to publish\n(Haselmayer et al., 2017; Kaye, & Johnson, 2016). This lowered people\u2019s trust in\nthe legacy media, which has contributed to the proliferation of yellow journalism\nunder the form of websites that publish information unselectively.\nIn general, news media have the power to focus collective attention on key\npublic issues (agenda setting) and to influence how different problems are defined\nand represented (attribute agenda setting). In a diffuse media ecology, fake news\nis highly influential in the creation of public awareness by establishing a dominant\ndiscourse regarding a wide range of policy topics (Brenner, 1988). People tend to\nallocate more importance to issues covered in the news, since these issues become\npart of their proximate social environments. Even if fake news is detached from\nevents in the real world, it still pushes issues onto the public agenda and dictates\nthe tone in which those issues are to be thought about. Fake news gained influence\nin a context in which legacy media are intricately connected with digital media.\nA comprehensive study of the media environment documented the agenda-setting\npower of fake news (Vargo, Guo, & Amazeen, 2018). The results show that fake\nnews is responsive to the agendas of partisan media. Moreover, the same study\nevidences that both partisan and emerging media are susceptible to fake news\u2019 lack\nof fact-checking. Therefore, we assist at a process of intermedia agenda setting\nin which fake news has real consequences by influencing the agenda of various\nplatforms. In these circumstances, the issue addressed by fake news becomes\nimportant rather than the facts. Since the media agenda is a result of the influence\nthat some groups exert in society, fake news depends on the interest of those\ngroups to legitimate particular social issues in order to gain political support for\ncontroversial reforms.\nTaking stock of the pressure to innovate in the persuasion industry\nThe contemporary fake news phenomenon appeared in a context in which\nthe persuasion industry faced increased pressure to innovate. News is a form of\ncommunication that appeals to an authoritative and influential voice to transmit a\nmessage of collective significance. Public relations specialists and other experts\nin strategic communication rely on the news format to promote particular ideas\nand offer more legitimacy to their points (Russel, 2015). Fake news, however, has\nbeen used as an alternative to traditional advertising and electoral spots due to\nthe need for a more persuasive voice to speak for the public by using a familiar\nand accessible medium.\nPublic opinion is a powerful force in modern societies. With the development\nof survey research and polls, public opinion has turned into a universe to be\n\nSOCIOLOGIE ROM\u00c2NEASC\u0102 - VOLUMUL 19(1)/2021\n138\nknown and understood. Public relations, advertising and propaganda are social\ninstitutions that have developed on these grounds. Since political actors extract\npower by shaping and controlling public opinion, the development of effective\nstrategies to manipulate people\u2019s beliefs and desires has also become a key priority\nin electoral campaigns. Media play an important role in the formation of public\nopinion by providing resources to address the general population, along with\npersuasive symbols to distribute political influence. However, public opinion is a\nsocial fiction used to designate forms of collective agency and make sense of the\nworld as a governable realm in a democratic society (Wilson, 2013). Fake news\nhas become a political instrument to build authoritative messages in a context in\nwhich public opinion is understood as an object that acts and is acted upon.\nDeconstructing the politics of elections\nThe contemporary fake news phenomenon emerged in a context in which\nemotions are considered a pivotal factor in persuasive political communication.\nTelevision and digital media rely on a visual imaginary that favours a more\npersonalised coverage of politics. Political debate is turned into a spectacle, with\ntelegenic and charismatic political leaders as the main protagonists. In this process,\nvoters are reduced to the role of spectators, and voting behaviour is understood as\na decision-making process governed by emotions rather than by critical reasoning\nor instrumental motives (Garry, 2013). Visual and interactive media appeal to\ncompelling and impactful messages able to generate political capital by promoting\nan emotional experience of the world.\nTherefore, fake news appeared in a context in which politics is disconnected\nfrom policy. In the post-truth society of today, emotions rather than factual\nfoundations are the basis on which political power is distributed (Rochlin, 2017).\nWebsites, blogs, posts and other similar sources make it difficult for people to\nfilter out biased content. The actual information ecosystem poses some challenges\nregarding how to select and identify a reliable source. Expert opinions are losing\ntheir authority and trustworthiness, as digital media has changed what counts as\nevidence. The rhetoric emerged in a post-truth world is based on a facticity of\nstatements that are detached from foundational realities. Political platforms built\non ambitious governmental projects are less influential than political platforms\nthat manipulate human emotions and fears (Bakir, & McStay, 2018). Furthermore,\nthe ideological groupings across the left-right spectrum are no longer meaningful\nto describe political orientations in a world in which the political game is played\nwith new rules and strategies.\n\n139\nSTUDII\nSociology of journalistic practice and media industry\nUnderstanding the business cultures of news production and dissemination\nLegacy journalism faces significant challenges in the digital area. Social\nmedia have absorbed some of the editorial functions of legacy news media. The\nproliferation of digital journalism has given people the opportunity to access free\nnews online. This has led to a decrease in the readership of major newspapers\nand audiences of radio and television stations, with media institutions being\nconfronted with drops in advertising revenue. In this context, legacy journalism\nas an industry has not always been able to develop sustainable business models\n(Cook, & Sirkkunen, 2013). Since legacy journalism is a market-driven economy,\nsensitive to contextual factors and dependent on public or private sources of\nincome, the transformations in the digital environment have brought about a crisis\nin the business model of legacy journalism organisations, which have accordingly\nbecome less secure (Schlesinger, & Doyle, 2014). Consequently, many media\norganisations have decreased the number of editorial and journalist staff positions.\nThe pressure to adapt to the imperatives of the digital world has impeded legacy\nmedia organisations from investing in accurate reporting.\nMedia agencies face pressure to develop business models that keep them\ncompetitive in an uncertain digital arena. This has led to the development of a\nbusiness culture that rejects investments that do not bring immediate financial\nbenefits. Nowadays, media companies have switched from protective strategies\nto opportunities-based strategies (Franklin, 2017), a process in which the quality\nof the news is negatively affected. In an ever-changing digital world, reputation\nis volatile and does not represent an economically value asset. The development\nof short-term strategies to increase profitability has reduced the importance of\nbuilding long-term reputation (Allcott, & Gentzkow, 2017). Fake news has evolved\nin a context in which the interest in developing an attractive format for storytelling\nwas more important than building a long-term relationship with the public based\non trust. Therefore, fake news has appeared as a value creation attempt in a highly\ncompetitive environment driven by instant gratification.\nThe magnitude of the fake news phenomenon invites us to rethink journalism\nand find a sustainable business model in news delivery and consumption. One\npossibility would be to switch from a profit-driven to a community-driven\njournalism. In such a model, users would deliberately pay to support a social cause\nby deciding what type of content to consume. This might build loyal audiences\nand establish an editorial commitment to quality.\n\nSOCIOLOGIE ROM\u00c2NEASC\u0102 - VOLUMUL 19(1)/2021\n140\nExploring the identity of the journalistic profession\nCollaborative editorial policy proved favourable for the development of the\nfake news phenomenon, especially in a context in which there was no systematic\nand powerful response from the journalist community (Richardson, 2017).\nFurthermore, a growing number of online information publishers resulted in a de-\nprofessionalisation of journalistic work. Journalism has started losing its identity\nas a community of practice, and nowadays, the boundaries between journalism,\npropaganda and activism are difficult to draw.\nCitizen journalism appeared as a response to media corporations dominated by\neconomic logic. Citizen journalism integrates forms of news reporting that rely on\nless institutionalised practices and allow people without professional journalism\ntraining to inform one another. Citizen journalism is a pivotal \u2018watchdog\u2019 practice\nin democratic societies (Watson, 2011). Driven by a desire to protect public\ninterests, citizen journalism practices might prevent abuses of power and draw\nattention to governmental wrongdoings, especially when mainstream media\nseem loyal to political parties and other interest groups. However, the rise of\nthe fake news phenomenon may be interpreted as an unintended consequence of\ncitizen journalism. Since potentially all citizen can be involved in disseminating\ninformation, the distinction between formal and informal discourse has become\nmore difficult to draw. Moreover, the authority of the source loses its referential\nfunction in the context of participatory user-generated content. Fact-checking\nplatforms and stance-detection algorithms aim to recover the authority of the\nsources as an orientation strategy for news consumers (Verma, Fleischmann, &\nKoltai, 2017).\nAssessing the regulatory frameworks in the diffusion of information\nThe rapid spread of fake news in digital environments caught society unprepared.\nThe phenomenon of fake news has gained momentum in the context of a loose\nregulation system that was unable to preserve freedom of speech, while still\ndiscouraging the production of deceptive content. Nevertheless, the actors that\norchestrated disinformation campaigns could barely be held accountable for the\nconsequences of their actions, since there is no law to address the phenomenon\nin appropriate legal terms. The publishers of falsities can only be liable under\ndefamation or commercial law if it is proven either that someone suffered\nreputational damage or that injurious falsehood brought financial loss to an\nenterprise (Pearson, 2017). Furthermore, fake news has become an influential\nphenomenon not strictly because someone produced deceptive content but because\nusers shared and diffused unverified information in a network. In this context, it\nis virtually impossible to apply sanctions for the spread of misleading stories,\nyet this is basically the key practice that guarantees the propagandistic success\nof fake news.\n\n141\nSTUDII\nSociology of online communities and digitally-mediated worlds\nComprehending the consequences of anonymity on the internet\nThe growth of user-generated content represents a factor that has increased\nthe amount of false information put into circulation with various aims: fun, profit,\npropaganda. Various interest groups have exploited the autarchic nature of the\ninternet and have deliberately disseminated deceptive content to accomplish their\nhidden agendas. The anonymous and pseudonymous features of online media have\nencouraged the propagation of fake news (Pew Research Center, 2017). Authors\nof misleading stories and reports can remain hidden under an avatar, thus making\nit difficult for consumers to identify the true origin of a content and decode the\nmessage properly. This situation erodes important norms of social communication\nby making content creators less accountable for the information they spread\n(Persily, 2017). Also, anonymity can lead to abusive behaviour and inflammatory\ndialogue, which may create an emotional collective drive that increases the impact\nof false information. However, anonymity is essential in preserving the freedom of\nexpression and right to privacy that characterise the internet as a democratic space.\nAnalysing the role of networks in mass communication and content\ncirculation\nThe internet has democratised the production and distribution of information in\nall forms, so people have a larger variety of sources to access. In today\u2019s dynamic\ndigital environment, content is circulated more than ever before. Online social\nnetworks allow rapid dissemination of information to a mass audience. The impact\nof this is a double-edged sword. On one side, online media are effective tools for\nconstructive communication: they empower minority groups to have a voice; they\nmake people aware of the latest scientific advances; they boost aid campaigns\nfor people in need and so on. On the other side, online media feed fake news by\ntaking advantage of the freedoms that characterise a democratic process. Once\nestablished, false or deceptive statements are difficult to correct due to the rapid,\nwidespread and uncontrolled dissemination of false information (Mustafaraj, &\nMetaxas, 2017). As Mustafaraj and Metaxas (2017) reveal, the process of fake\nnews circulation leaves online traces that continue to shape public thinking on\nissues with social and political relevance even after debunking.\nOnline social networks originated as tools for social interaction. However, they\nhave progressively become used for entertainment purposes, marketing campaigns\nand ultimately for news consumption. Now, social networks are important sources\nof information about politics and public issues (Allcott, & Gentzkow, 2017). In\nthis context, online media have promoted novel formats and models of news\nconsumption that have favoured the spread of fake news and its increased social\nimpact. Online media has changed the way news looks. For example, social\n\nSOCIOLOGIE ROM\u00c2NEASC\u0102 - VOLUMUL 19(1)/2021\n142\nnetworks have unfolded a decontextualized space of meaning by favouring short-\nlength articles and visual imaginaries. Moreover, smartphone technology has\npromoted a fugitive mode of news consumption in which users are more prone\nto react to an article\u2019s headline without reading the entire text. This kind of\nconsumption practice makes it difficult for people to judge the accuracy of news\nreports, and usually the information is believed at face value (McQueen, 2018).\nMuch of the current media do not support reflection and favour an incidental model\nof news consumption, thereby paving the road that has turned fake news into a\nphenomenon with social and political implications.\nNews as part of the journalistic genre has always integrated in its production\nprocess the pressure to get information to the audience quickly. Online media\nprovide instantaneous coverage, which the legacy media cannot always afford. The\nculture of social media platforms favours instantaneity and produces a drive for\nimmediacy that has established the grounds on which the fake news phenomenon\nhas emerged (Bakir, & McStay, 2018). The interest to get stories immediately, as\nwell as the rapid and widespread circulation of content make people (journalists\nand news consumers alike) pay less effort to time-consuming practices such as\nfact-checking or tracking down sources. The instantaneity of news delivery is\ncomplemented by the instantaneity of news consumption. Online media not only\nprovide instantaneous information to their users; they also allow for synchronicity\nin communication (Mustafaraj, & Metaxas, 2017). Audiences can react immediately\nin support of a misleading content whose power is exerted in the very process of\nimmediate consumption.\nSocial networks are organised on homophilic considerations based on geographic\nand ideological similarities between members. This form of social organisation\nmediates \u201csocial worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the information\n[users] receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience\u201d\n(McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001, 415). Therefore, the digital media divide\npeople into \u2018echo chambers\u2019, where users are exposed to arguments in one specific\ndirection. This fragmented media environment implicitly invites people to rely on\nself-confirming sources when judging aspects of social reality, thereby reinforcing\nexisting beliefs and legitimating misleading information (Spohr, 2017). Selective\nexposure to ideologically biased content and the technological mediation of echo\nchambers have fuelled fake news stories and amplified their impact.\nAcknowledging the social power of algorithms\nPeople have multiple sources of information in the digital world. In this context,\nhuman attention has become a scarce commodity that can be traded, bought or sold\nto make profit (Thrift, 2006). As a consequence, online companies are economic\nagents that operate on an attention market \u201cin which platforms acquire time\nfrom consumers and sell access to that time to advertisers who want to deliver\nmessages to those consumers\u201d (Evans, 2017, 1). Since attention economics shapes\n\n143\nSTUDII\nbusiness models in the digital era, fake news has emerged as a result of how online\ncompanies generate revenue. Richard Lanham considers that attracting attention\nis a matter of style: \u201c[T]he devices that regulate attention are stylistic devices\u201d\n(Richard, 2006, xi). According to this perspective, style is the currency of the new\neconomy. Under the logic of online connectivity, we assist to a transformation of\nstyle in order to maximise users\u2019 interest. Outrage, anger and fear are influential\nrhetorical components in a digital information ecosystem fraught with fake news.\nOn the one hand, events happen at a rapid pace, and users are not prepared to\nparticipate responsibly in this attention economy. On the other hand, business\nalgorithms are not neutral to ethics and morals: algorithms are social technologies\nthat have the power to define what is important in the world and thus enforce a\nsystem of values by focusing public attention on socio-technically emerging codes\nand canons (Verbeek, 2008). Profitability as a business value of tech companies\nhas become a force that has taken over the quest for objectivity and reliability.\nFake news is also understood as a consequence of the business models that\nconnect advertisers with website publishers by negotiating the amount of money\npaid per click (Braun, & Eklund, 2019). Digital platforms integrate ranking\nalgorithms and real-time auction systems to distribute content in a network.\nThese kinds of tools allow companies and other online agents to make profit by\nstrategically placing digital advertising. Consequentially, the business models\nused by technology companies have facilitated the development of online spaces\nthat encourage visitors to click in order to generate advertising money (Graham,\n2017). This has provoked a rush for engaged audiences and incentivised web\npublishers to deliberately post objectionable content that generates revenue. The\nfake news phenomenon has been amplified by platforms that feature misleading\nsensational articles on trending ideas and topics. The information digital ecosystem\nis organised to nudge users to profitable behaviour by provoking affective responses\nfrom them. Fake news has proven profitable as a form of \u2018clickbait journalism\u2019\ndeveloped under the regime of affective capitalism. Affective capitalism unfolds\na social order in which emotions are treated as commodities. Namely, emotions\nare activated and circulated, since they generate viewing time, which is converted\ninto profit. Fake news has appeared as a form of manifestation in a context in\nwhich emotions are monetised and affects are exploited to produce economic\nvalue (Bakir, & McStay, 2018).\nFake news can be understood as a cultural implication of how search engines\nfunction. The most common search engines use business models based on various\nmethods to estimate the costs of words and phrases. By monetising web content,\nwords become economic resources: keywords and expressions are transformed\ninto commodities that are sold on a linguistic market. This gives rise to a form of\nlinguistic capitalism that has contributed to the spread of fake news by incentivising\nthe use of profitable formulations (Graham, 2017). The algorithms of search\nengines have influenced language use on the web and marked off a decline of\nonline language diversity by prioritising the vocabularies with more economic\n\nSOCIOLOGIE ROM\u00c2NEASC\u0102 - VOLUMUL 19(1)/2021\n144\nvalue over others. Therefore, the financial models have significant effects on online\ndiscourse, since such models aim \u201cto develop intimate and sustainable linguistic\nrelationships with the largest possible number of users in order to model linguistic\nchange accurately and mediate linguistic expression systematically\u201d (Kaplan,\n2014, 60-61). By taking into consideration that our language is interlinked with\nthinking, we can talk about an algorithmic mediation of what we know about the\nworld and how we know it. Since our knowledge is technologically mediated, the\nlinguistic biases of the search engines\u2019 algorithms have generated the language of\nfake news with a performative role in the making of social realities.\nSearch engines, social networks and other digital platforms are designed to track\nonline behaviour and record users\u2019 preferences and needs. These kinds of platforms\nare based on market segmentation techniques that can help commercial agents or\npolitical organisations easily identify potential customers or supporters. Algorithms\nprioritise information and provide customised content in order to enhance user-\nexperience and increase the effectiveness of the information distribution circle,\nin a process that aligns the interests of various stakeholders. The technical and\nfunctional affordances of digital media favour a more convenient model of targeted\nadvertising, which increases the level of precision in strategic communication by\nallowing the delivery of relevant messages to targeted audiences (Livingstone,\n2019). Even if the actual information ecosystem improves communication\nefficiency and performance, the ecosystem still poses some challenges and social\nrisks. Driven by financial gains, online platforms allow advertisers to tailor their\nmessages to different audiences. Specifically, the same advertiser could say different\nthings to different people, thus producing an altered sense of reality. Confusion\ncarried an anomic state as a social setting that encouraged the growth of fake news.\nReviewing instruments of audio and video manipulation\nNew technologies have changed the practices of knowledge production and\nprovided new tools for digital content editing (Carlson, 2009). Software for photo,\naudio or video manipulation enhances the impact of fake news by functioning as\ninstruments to produce fabricated but credible evidence in support of deceitful\nreports. Bots, paid commentators and fake accounts are resources used in propaganda\ncampaigns to give a sense of widespread acceptance and circulation of content.\nBy working as joint voices in support of various propagandistic initiatives, these\nfabricated reactions increase the capacity for fake news to spread and produce\nreal effects in the social world (Shao et al., 2018). The possibility to emulate the\nillusion of factual news and authentic debate through socio-technical manipulation\nhas played a considerable role in making fake news influential in the contemporary\nworld.\n\n145\nSTUDII\nSociology of culture and discourse\nEnquiring into the changing nature of values\nThe changing philosophy of truth has encouraged a new commitment to\nnotions of objectivity and neutrality. Contemporary culture is described by an\nincreased awareness of the contingent nature of social reality. Moral, aesthetic\nand cognitive relativism are significant philosophical positions, postulating the\nimpossible existence of a metaphysically valid standpoint that could function as an\nabsolute standard of truth (Harsin, 2015). We do not live in a world in which truth\nis the ultimate goal that might be achieved through instrumentation and rational\ndeliberation; rather, we live in a world in which truth is established relative to\nthe position of a particular social actor in a status system. The contemporary fake\nnews phenomenon has appeared in a cultural context in which the relativity of\nknowledge is assumed as the main epistemic stance. As Nick Rocklin puts is, \u201cthe\ntruth of the post-truth is that truth does not matter\u201d (Rochlin, 2017): reasoning and\ncognition cannot be separated from moral judgments and value-driven approaches,\nthus weakening the distinction between facts and values.\nAn increase of public trust in pseudoscience has also opened the road to\nthe contemporary fake news phenomenon. Science as a social institution has\nstarted to lose its legitimacy and cultural authority, so that the ability of scientific\nfacts and discourses to influence public debate has been challenged accordingly\n(Lidskog, 1996). Testimonial and anecdotal evidence has become more and more\ninfluential in shaping an understanding of the world. The facticity of scientific\ninquiry is obstructed by the sensationalist and emotional rhetoric found within\nonline forums and participatory environments (Introne et al, 2018). Fake news\nis just a specific manifestation of a more extensive (dis)information ecosystem\npenetrated by pseudoscientific theories. In this ecosystem, scientific claims with no\npredictive and explanatory power, published in predatory journals, are appropriated\nas rigorous and reliable evidence; this process fuels yellow journalism practices.\nScrutinizing the performative role of language\nNews sharing over social networks can be understood as a form of communicative\naction. According to Jurgen Habermas, communicative action is \u201cthe use of\nlanguage as a medium for a kind of reaching understanding, in the course of which\nparticipants, through relating to a world, reciprocally raise validity claims that can\nbe accepted or contested\u201d (Habermas, 1981, 99). Communicative action is based\non an inherent communicative rationality as a sense-making scheme \u201coriented\nto achieving, sustaining and reviewing consensus - and indeed a consensus that\nrests on the intersubjective recognition of criticisable validity claims\u201d (Habermas,\n1981, 17).\n\nSOCIOLOGIE ROM\u00c2NEASC\u0102 - VOLUMUL 19(1)/2021\n146\nLanguage is performative in the sense that \u201csaying something is doing\nsomething\u201d (Austin, 1962). The interpretation of a situation shapes reality by\ncausing actions that produce social effects: if people define situations as real, those\nsituations can become real in their consequences (Thomas, & Thomas, 1928).\nWords designate a world that becomes real according to how the world is defined.\nIn that sense, fake news represents a form of communication that is performative.\nFake news instructs audiences how to think about public issues, thus mediating\nmodes of knowing social reality. This is important, since people act according to\nthe understanding they have of the world. Digital media operate under particular\n\u201cregimes of truth\u201d (Foucault, 1991) instantiated through manifold online discursive\npractices. Power is embodied in discourse and forms of knowledge, so fake news\nplays a political role by defining and redefining what counts as true. However, the\nsocio-technical organisation of the digital world makes it difficult to differentiate\nbetween true and false statements and generates a sense of confusion that can be\nused for political gains.\nSocial psychology\nDisclosing cognitive biases in information processing\nThe digital environment contains an overabundance of information, contradictory\ncontent and data of questionable accuracy. In the context of information overload,\ninternet users are required to make judgments under conditions of uncertainty and\ntime pressure. Therefore, people rely on heuristics and mental shortcuts to process\nand interpret the information they receive through various media channels. This\nleads to different cognitive biases as vulnerability factors for misinformation\n(De keersmaecker, & Roets, 2017). People tend to use adaptative strategies and\ncreate their subjective social reality based on various errors: confirmation bias,\nillusionary correlation, selective exposure, belief perseverance and so on. These\nerrors represent sociopsychological phenomena and organising principles of\nhuman cognition that have played a key role in the spread of fake news. Fake\nnews functions as pieces of information that introduce cognitive clarification\nand help people make sense of the world. In the absence of relevant resources or\nexperiences, false rumours are powerful devices in the communication enterprise,\nsince they help people overcome a knowledge deficit and navigate the complexity\nof the social world. Accordingly, fake news assimilates powerful cognitive models\nof motivated reasoning that reinforce pre-existing beliefs and ideas.\nGrasping the dynamics of group behaviour in digital networks\nThe digital environment has changed the way news is consumed: news\nconsumption today is a participatory and collaborative practice. Citizens are\n\n147\nSTUDII\nempowered to comment on and debate the news instantly, thus negotiating the\nmeaning of the account by using both an instrumental and normative understanding\nof the social world. Digital media accommodate social interactions and the\nprocesses through which fake news is validated and authenticated discursively\n(but not factually). Validity claims are vehiculated in technologically mediated\ndiscussions, thereby turning fake news into credible and legitimate information to\nconsider. Moreover, social networks support the formation of social relationships\nbased on trust, so fake news is distributed in a social space in which people trust\neach other. Consequentially, users of the social networks do not assess the validity\nof the shared information because they assume that other actors have carried the\nsymbolic costs of validation (Tandoc et al., 2017). In this context, the diffusion of\nresponsibility as a social process has contributed to the consolidation of the fake\nnews phenomenon in actual society.\nIn explaining how society makes a transition from mass behaviour to\nsocial networks, Michel Maffesoli describes the postmodern era as an era of\nneotribalism (Maffesoli, 1996). By using the metaphor of tribes, Maffesoli points\nto the development of digital tribes as transient and fluid social groups whose\nmembers gather based on shared interests, beliefs and aesthetics. In this context,\nnews sharing can be understood not only as a communicative act but also as a\ndramaturgical action (Goffman, 1956). News sharing is part of the impression\nmanagement practices through which people express their self and consolidate\ntheir image. News sharing facilitates online interactions that create a dynamic of\ngroup life. Even if digital tribes are characterised by their transitory nature, they\nfunction as discursive communities guided by communal ethics through which\nmembers express their views and participate in a culture. News sharing is a social\nactivity that brings people together, thus consolidating a sense of solidarity and\ncollective identity (Polletta, & Callahan, 2017). Fake news exploits the sense\nof togetherness found in already established virtual worlds. Since emotions are\nessential components of group life, fake news reinforces various values and\nbeliefs by manipulating anger and fear to serve the interests of political parties,\ncompanies or other agents.\nTracking down the emergence of social movements\nThe preference for opinionated rather than impartial news has fostered novel\ndefinitions about what it means to be informed (Marchi, 2012). News that makes\na normative point has become more influential than news guided by the principle\nof neutrality. Embracing civic attitudes in online areas is now equivalent to\nexpressing concerns for issues that reflect personal values and experiences. Digital\nmedia have affected the conception of citizenship by providing alternative forms\nof political action. In this process, digitally mediated platforms have redefined\nthe dynamics that drive political commitment and have changed what constitutes\ncivic engagement (Bennet, 2008). Digital communication has created not only\n\nSOCIOLOGIE ROM\u00c2NEASC\u0102 - VOLUMUL 19(1)/2021\n148\nthe foundation for making governments responsive to people\u2019s concerns though\ne-democracy initiatives but also the other way around: individuals have become\nmore vulnerable to propagandistic attempts. Therefore, the decline of conventional\npolitical participation created a context that has favoured the spread of deceptive\ncontent as new connections to government have been established. Engagement\nin political discussion has taken different forms, and the digital opportunities for\npolitical self-expression trigger social movements to either challenge or enforce\npower relation.\nConclusion\nFake news is a complex social phenomenon whose determinants cannot be\nneatly separated in categories if misinformation resides in the interdependence\nbetween journalistic organisations, communication technologies, receptive\naudiences and governmental regulations. So far, media studies have approached\nthe phenomenon of fake news largely from the perspective of cultivation theory;\nmany empirical endeavours were conducted to explore how a particular medium\ndetermines a particular message with focus on the processes through which various\nmessages induce effects on their audiences. By relying on traditional models of\ncommunication, media studies have somehow been ignorant to the structural\nprocesses that lay behind fake news. In this context, a more visible, coherent and\ntheoretically sound sociological perspective in media studies might contribute\nto a better understanding of the nature of misinformation in present-day society\nespecially when it is complemented by methodologies that consider fake news\nprimarily as a social phenomenon and secondly as a communicational outcome\nand product of cultural consumption.\nThis paper has proposed a sociological research agenda to explore fake news\nas a social phenomenon in the digital age. Firstly, we consider that a sociological\napproach to fake news should revisit the classical theories of media influences and\nrethink the processes that coagulate the intermedia agenda setting. In a context in\nwhich media industry faces an increased pressure to innovate and many sources of\ninformation are outside the control of gate keeping instances, media studies should\nreveal the methods to deconstruct discourses as main drivers of persuasion and the\ntechniques to interpret strategies that act on public opinion in a post-truth reality.\nSecondly, sociologically informed media studies should take into consideration the\nchanges that characterize both the practice of journalism and the social organization\nof news media. The business cultures of news production and dissemination\nare based on economic models that give rise to less institutionalized practices\nand regulatory frameworks, which necessities a close scientific examination and\nan attentive sociological inquiry. Thirdly, media studies would benefit from a\nsociological approach by considering the role of digital technologies in changing\nglobal media industries and cultural consumption practices. In this sense, future\n\n149\nSTUDII\nresearch should consider the role of algorithms in shaping the objectivity and\nreliability of information in a networked culture. Issues of surveillance capitalism,\nlinguistic capitalism, economy of attention and experience economy should be\nfurther taken into consideration. Moreover, an interdisciplinary study of fake news\nphenomena could not ignore the performativity of language and the regimes of\ntruth that are built through communicative actions in online discourse communities.\nFinally, media studies should integrate a sociological focus by exploring fake news\nas a function of group dynamics emerged in digital networks. This implies an\ninquiry on processes that are heterogeneous in nature by generating new cognitive\nbiases, by redefining issues of accountability and responsibility for content creation\nand distribution, as well as by enabling new practices of social identity formation.\nNowadays, fake news is considered a social problem. As such, it has become a\ntop priority for technology companies and governments. Various initiatives have\nbeen established to cope with the production and distribution of misleading and\ndeceptive information (Huckle, & White, 2017; Sethi, 2017). The actions taken to\ncontrol the challenges of a post-truth media culture are built on multiple layers.\nThey include various sorts of initiatives such as 1) grass root initiatives (e.g.\ncreating a black list of websites that produce fake news); 2) specialised initiatives\n(e.g. developing news curators through algorithms and crawling techniques); and\n3) governmental initiatives (e.g. legislative undertakings meant to censor some\nmessages and impose sanctions on media trusts that vehiculate untrustworthy\ninformation). The initiatives rely on different political philosophies: some of them\nare based on liberal principles by favouring participation and dialogue, while\nothers seriously threaten the freedom of expression necessary in a democratic\nsociety. The current legislative initiatives to target fake news are contested, as they\nfoster authoritarian regimes of censorship. Regulations might silence dissenting\nand critical voices and give rise to abuses rather than safeguarding the public from\nfalse information. Other initiatives that rely on computational or fact-checking\napproaches usually have minimal impact, since such approaches face difficulties in\ndisseminating corrections. Also, they rely on a philosophy detached from current\nsocial realities: evidence-based reasoning is not efficient in the post-truth world.\nTherefore, current efforts to combat fake news reveal a misunderstanding of the\nissue.\nWe argue that the popular discourse focuses predominantly on the role of\ntechnologies in the creation and spread of misleading information but ignores the\ninfluence of other factors that have contributed substantially to the emergence of\nthe fake news phenomenon as we know it today. Social networks and other online\nplatforms operated in a context in which society has been already vulnerable to\npropaganda and other similar actions by amplifying the risks that derive from the\nuse of technologies. There is no single factor responsible for the spread of fake\nnews, but the fake news phenomenon has emerged through the joint influence of\ntechnological, economic, sociocultural and political factors on human interactions\nand practices.\n\nSOCIOLOGIE ROM\u00c2NEASC\u0102 - VOLUMUL 19(1)/2021\n150\nMany initiatives might be subject to failure because they miss an important\npiece in the puzzle: namely, there are multiple causes of the fake news phenomenon\nthat might be noticed by embracing a more prominent sociological focus in media\nstudies. Fake news does not only depend on technologies and their business models\nbut also on the rationality on which politics is done and on various social processes\nand dynamics. While the current initiatives are focused on handling misleading\ntextual content in the news industry, new advances in artificial intelligence and\ncomputer graphics pose important challenges in the dissemination of deceptive\nnews in credible forms. In this context, there is a critical need for measures to\nimprove people\u2019s media literacy. However, the most common measures do little to\neducate the public about the consequences of fake news on the lives of ordinary\npeople.\nFake news is a complex social phenomenon that appears at the intersection of\nvarious contextual factors that influence information processing at a social level.\nThis discussion in the paper also provides insights that support the necessity to\ncomplement fact-checking and computational measures through initiatives that\nempower news consumers and build awareness of various social configurations\nand technologically mediated realities.\nAcknowledgment\nPaper developed with support from Digital News Initiative.\nReferences\nAllcott, H., & Gentzkow, M.

Minas and Alan R. Dennis\nKelley School of Business Indiana University\nAbstract\nFake news (i.e., misinformation) on social media has sharply increased over the past few years.\nWe conducted an experiment collecting behavioral and EEG data from 83 social media users to\nunderstand whether they could detect fake news on social media, and whether the presence of a\nfake news flag affected their cognition and judgment. We found that the presence of a fake news\nflag triggered increased cognitive activity and users spent more time considering the headline.\nHowever, the flag had no effect on judgments about truth; flagging headlines as false did not\ninfluence users\u2019 beliefs. A post-hoc analysis shows that confirmation bias is pervasive, with\nusers more likely to believe news headlines that align with their political opinions. Headlines that\nchallenge their opinions receive little cognitive attention (i.e., they are ignored) and users are less\nlikely to believe them.\n\n1\nFake News on Social Media: People Believe What They Want to\nBelieve When it Makes No Sense at All\n\u201cThere is today a special need for propaganda analysis. America is beset by\na confusion of conflicting propagandas, a Babel of voices, warnings-charges,\ncounter-charges, assertions, and contradictions assailing us continually through\npress, radio and newsreel\u2026\u201d (Institute for Propaganda Analysis 1938, p. 1).\n\u201cWe are facing nothing less than a crisis in our democracy \u2013 based on the\nsystematic manipulation of data to support the relentless targeting of citizens,\nwithout their consent, by campaigns of disinformation and messages of hate.\u201d\n(House of Commons 2018)\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the early days of the Internet, people argued that the Internet would enable greater\ntransparency of information, which would increase the quality of democracies (Abramson et al.\n1990; Tewksbury 2003). The availability of information from various news sources would\nenable people to find their own information from non-traditional news outlets, and this decreased\nreliance on a narrow set of traditional news sources would improve democracy (defined as \u201cthe\nbelief in freedom and equality between people, or a system of government based on this belief\u201d\n(Dictionary 2018)). This vision has been realized with the rise of non-traditional news on social\nmedia, but some might argue that the prevalence of fake news on social media has harmed\ndemocracy, rather than improved it. An editorial in Science calls on the scientific community to\nhelp reporters and the general public better identify and avoid fake news (Weiss 2017).\nSocial media has become a common source for news; more than 50% of American adults\nread news on social media (Gottfried and Shearer 2016). Social media is different from other\nmedia providing news (e.g., TV news, news websites, and mobile phone news apps) because\nusers do not choose the source of all of the articles they see on social media. Instead, proprietary\nalgorithms provide targeted information with little transparency. With other news media, users\npick the source first, and do so with a familiarity of the nature of the source (Rice et al. 2018).\n\n2\nWith social media such as Facebook, articles from a wide variety of sources appear on\nusers\u2019 newsfeeds. News articles are intermixed with sponsored articles (i.e., paid advertisements)\nand posts from family and friends. All of these may be intentionally or unintentionally true or\nfalse, but some are explicitly designed to influence (Shane 2017). For example, Cambridge\nAnalytica developed tools to influence users after it gained access to more than 50 million users\u2019\ndata (Granville 2018). About 23% of social media users report that they have accidently or\nintentionally shared fake news (Barthel et al. 2016). Over 60% say that fake news leaves them\nconfused about what to believe (Barthel et al. 2016).\nSocial media has moved quality control for detecting fake news from trained journalists\nto regular users (Kim and Dennis 2018). About 84% of Americans believe that they can detect\nfake news (Barthel et al. 2016), but how do users detect fake news when most users have no\ndirect knowledge of the facts (i.e., they have not witnessed the events)?\nIn this study, we examine the effect of a Facebook \u201cfake news\u201d flag and how social\nmedia users respond to it. Simply put, we examine the question: are fake news flags effective in\naltering users\u2019 beliefs? We use electroencephalography (EEG) to examine cognitive processes\n(Dimoka et al. 2012; Vance et al. 2018). We found that flagging articles as fake triggered more\ncognitive activity, but it did not change users\u2019 beliefs in them. We further found that articles that\naligned with the user\u2019s a priori opinions triggered increased cognitive activity, with users more\nlikely to believe them; articles that challenged users\u2019 opinions were less thoroughly considered\nand were less likely to be believed. Our findings triangulate around one explanation:\nconfirmation bias; users believe what matches their prior opinions, undeterred by the actual truth\nof an article or a fake news flag. As John Mellencamp said in his 2004 song, Walk Tall, \u201cPeople\nbelieve what they want to believe/when it makes no sense at all\u201d (Mellencamp 2004).\n\n3\nPRIOR THEORY AND RESEARCH\nNews has always been questionable in its reliability (McGrath 1986). Even before the rise\nof the Internet, certain newspapers were known for their biases and potentially distorted news\n(McGrath 1986). The Internet enables people to access thousands of different news sources,\nrather than being bound by traditional sources, increasing their exposure to biased and distorted\nnews. The 2016 US presidential election was rife with news, both true and false. Compounding\nthis difficulty, social media users had to contend with the intentional production and distribution\nof fake news, whether created to generate revenue from advertisements (Kirby 2016) or to\ninfluence the election (Fisher 2016; Shane 2017; Sydell 2016). Social media platforms have been\ncriticized for not taking sufficient action to prevent the spread of fake news (Maheshwari 2017).\nIn the sections below, we examine why assessing the truthfulness of news on social\nmedia is difficult, and how flagging fake articles as \u201cdisputed by third-party fact-checkers\u201d and\nconfirmation bias may influence users\u2019 beliefs. We focus on Facebook as a leader in social\nmedia; Facebook has over 2 billion active users and is a popular source for news (Gottfried and\nShearer 2016; Statista 2018).\nAssessing the Truthfulness of News on Social Media\nContext matters (Johns 2006; Johns 2017). \u201cOne way to develop richer theories that\nprovide actionable advice is to take the context into greater consideration\u201d (Hong et al. 2014,\np.2). Much past IS research has examined work contexts, but our focus is on social media. Most\nindividuals use social media for hedonic purposes (Chauhan and Pillai 2013), such as seeking\nentertainment or connecting with friends, rather than utilitarian purposes (Johnson and Kaye\n2015). Following steps 1-4 in Table 1 of Hong et al., we ground our research in two general\ntheories (confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance) and examine how they influence behavior\n\n4\nin this use context. We identified three context-specific factors that make consuming news on\nsocial media different from other contexts in which users view information on the Internet.\nFirst, the user\u2019s mindset is different, which affects how information is processed. The\nconsumption of news on social media is different than the consumption of information elsewhere\non the Internet. For example, it is well known that some product reviews are fake (Dwoskin and\nShaban 2018; Dwoskin and Timberg 2018; Roberts 2013). A key difference between fake\nreviews and fake news is that users do not read product reviews for entertainment; they read\nreviews for information to make a decision, knowing there is a monetary incentive to make the\nbest, most well-informed decision. Thus, users reading fake reviews are in a utilitarian mindset;\ntheir goal is to understand the meaning of the information in the review and to decide which\nreviews should be considered in making a decision. Minas et al (2014) examined a utilitarian\nmindset in virtual team interactions in a decision-making context. The study found confirmation\nbias was present while individuals processed information in a decision-making team-based chat.\nIn contrast, the hedonic mindset when reading social media news means the user\u2019s goal is not to\ndetermine what is true and fake; instead the goal is enjoyment and pleasure. The user will avoid\neffortful activities that feel like work (e.g., thoughtful information processing) and activities that\ndo not bring enjoyment (e.g., reading stories that your favorite sports team lost). Users engage\nwith articles that make them feel good, which tend to be articles supporting their beliefs.\nSecond, the source of the information is not clear. With Internet news and traditional\nnews media, we visit the web site of our favorite news network or open our local newspaper; we\npick the source before we read articles and do so with some understanding of the source\u2019s\nlimitations (Rice et al. 2018). Facebook is different because users do not choose the source of the\narticles; instead, Facebook\u2019s algorithms choose the articles. Although some users subscribe to\n\n5\ncertain sources by following them on social media, many other sources arrive on our newsfeeds\nfrom advertisements, sharing by friends, and algorithmic decisions. Articles from many different\nsources\u2014some reputable, some disreputable\u2014are intermixed. A fake news article may be\npresented between a CNN article and Aunt Martha\u2019s cookies. The source of the story is obscured\n(Kim and Dennis 2018), and users in a hedonic mindset are not motivated to invest effort to find\nand understand the source (Kim and Dennis 2018).\nFinally, the sheer volume of fake news makes it challenging to separate truth from\nfiction. More fake news articles are shared on social media than real news (Silverman 2016).\nMany fake news sites have appeared on Facebook with the express purpose of spreading\ncarefully-crafted propaganda or to discredit a specific person (BBC 2017). Their low cost and\nubiquity is one reason that fake news is common on social media (Barthel et al. 2016).\nThese three contextual factors\u2014a hedonic mindset, a lack of cognizance of the source,\nand the volume of fake news\u2014combine to create a context in which social media users do not\nthink as critically as they should when presented with news on social media. More than half the\narticles shared on Twitter are shared without the user reading them, let alone thinking critically\nabout them (Gabielkov et al. 2016). Nonetheless, research shows that there is a bias toward\ntaking an opinion on contentious social media topics, rather than remaining neutral (Jonas 2001).\nThis is true even when users lack information on the topic\u2014or bother to read an article\u2014which\nhelps the spread of fake news (Jonas 2001).\nFact-Checking Fake News\nIn response to the rise of fake news, fact checking services have become more common.\nMany solutions have been developed to automate fact-checking. Truthy (Ratkiewicz et al. 2011)\nand Hoaxy (Shao et al. 2016) are two such solutions, which can provide relatively quick results\n\n6\nfor news articles. Truthy fact-checks sites that are well-known for verifying the truth of news\narticles, such as Snopes.com, politifact.com, and factcheck.org, as well as checking known\ndisreputable sites for fake news articles. Fact-checking can influence credibility, especially if\ndone by independent fact-checkers (Wintersieck 2017).\nFacebook incorporated fact-checking into its platform and began flagging fake news\narticles in late 2016 by appending a statement that an article was \u201cdisputed by 3 \nrd \nparty fact-\ncheckers\u201d when fact-checkers determined an article was fake (Schaedel 2017). Thus, fact-\nchecking was integrated into the presentation of the article; users did not need to invest effort to\nseek out a third-party fact-checking site. Facebook discontinued the flag in late 2017 (Meixler\n2017). One might conclude that Facebook\u2019s actions indicate that fact-checking fake news is not\neffective. However, the undisclosed reasons why a for-profit corporation makes decisions\u2014\nespecially when its goals are unclear (c.f., Zuckerberg 2016)\u2014are not theoretically compelling.\nAfter Facebook discontinued its fake news flag, third parties began offering their own\nfake news flagging services that can be integrated into Facebook. For example, NewsGuard\nprovides a browser plugin using source reliability ratings from teams of expert journalists and\nconsultants for more than 4,500 news sites that account for 98% of the online news in the U.S.\n(NewsGuard 2018). The plugin automatically displays a fake news flag whenever content from a\ndisreputable source is displayed, whether in Facebook or any Web site.\nFact-checking is most important when the user wants to believe a headline; flagging a\nheadline when the user was unlikely to believe it without the flag adds little value. Thus, we\nfocus on the situation where a user is inclined to believe a fake headline, but it is flagged as false.\nThe Effects of Confirmation Bias\nOne factor influencing belief is confirmation bias: people prefer information that matches\n\n7\ntheir prior beliefs (Koriat et al. 1980; Minas et al. 2014; Nickerson 1998). Confirmation bias is a\nbias against information that challenges one\u2019s beliefs (Nickerson 1998); it is driven by the\nfundamental nature of our cognition (Kahneman 2011).\nResearchers have long argued that there are two distinctly different cognitive processes,\nand there are many dual process models of cognition (Evans 2008). Two complementary models\nemerged in the 1980s. The Heuristic-Systematic Model (HSM) (Chaiken 1980; Chaiken and\nEagly 1983) argues that attitudes are formed by the systematic application of considerable\ncognitive effort to comprehend and evaluate the validity of available information (called the\nsystematic route), or by exerting little cognitive effort using simple heuristics on readily\naccessible information (called the heuristic route). The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM)\n(Cacioppo et al. 1986; Petty and Cacioppo 1986) argues that attitudes are formed based on\ndeliberate and active consideration of available information to evaluate the true merits of a\nparticular position (called the central route) or as a result of a less cognitively involved\nassessment of simple positive or negative cues in the context (called the peripheral route).\nThere are distinctions between HSM and ELM, but they share a common fundamental\nbasis. Both argue that there are two distinct conscious cognitive processes by which attitudes are\nformed, and that these two processes differ in the amount of cognitive processing expended (e.g.,\na quantitative difference) and in the cognitive approach used to evaluate information (e.g., a\nqualitative difference). Both argue that individuals choose which route to invoke based on their\nability and motivation to engage in extensive cognition. Both have evolved to argue that the\nroutes are not distinct, so cognition is more of a continuum of processing (Kitchen et al. 2014).\nELM is the more popular and is still used today (Cacioppo et al. 2018), although some\nresearchers dispute the notion of dual process models (Melnikoff and Bargh 2018).\n\n8\nMany newer dual process models have been developed (Evans 2008; Evans and\nStanovich 2013), because research suggests that many of the fundamental arguments of HSM\nand ELM (as revised over time in response to criticisms (Kitchen et al. 2014)) are not accurate.\nFor example, the routes are not mutually exclusive (both can be used); the routes are not on a\ncontinuum (they are separate); individuals do not choose the route to use (the heuristic route is\nautomatic); individuals cannot avoid the heuristic route (its use is involuntary); and the\nsystematic route cannot operate by itself (the heuristic route always precedes it) (De Neys 2018;\nEvans 2008; Evans and Stanovich 2013; Kahneman 2011; Pennycook et al. 2018).\nIn this paper, we adopt the widely accepted dual process model of Stanovich (1999) and\nKahneman (2011) who call these separate processes System 1 and System 2. We note that\nStanovich has more recently suggested using the terms Type 1 and Type 2 because the use of the\nword \u201csystem\u201d implies there are separate areas in the brain that are dedicated to each type of\ncognition, which is not the case (Evans and Stanovich 2013).\nSystem 1 runs continuously, and delivers conclusions automatically and involuntarily\n(Kahneman 2011). Intuition is System 1 at work (Achtziger and Al\u00f3s-Ferrer 2013; Dennis and\nMinas 2018). When we receive new information, our System 1 cognition automatically searches\nlong-term memory for confirming evidence and generates a response in less than one second\n(Bargh and Ferguson 2000; Carlston and Skowronski 1994; Fazio et al. 1986). This process is\nnonconscious and unavoidable; we cannot prevent it (Evans and Stanovich 2013; Kahneman\n2011). It supplies these assessments, even though they are not asked for (Bellini-Leite 2013;\nDennis and Minas 2018; Kahneman 2011; Thompson 2013). System 1 is a set of subsystems that\nrun in parallel triggered by different bits of incoming information (Bellini-Leite 2013; Evans\n2008; Evans 2014; Thompson 2013). When the different subsystems produce matching results,\n\n9\nSystem 1 produces a \u201cFeeling of Rightness\u201d (FOR) that says it is confident about its conclusions\n(Bago and De Neys 2017; De Neys 2014; Thompson et al. 2011). When there is conflict among\nsubsystems\u2019 results, FOR creates a sense that something is not right (Bago and De Neys 2017).\nIn contrast, System 2 cognition is single-threaded (Dennis and Minas 2018) and has much\nless processing capacity (Evans 2014). System 2 is under our deliberate control, so we can\nchoose to invoke it, but it is easily overwhelmed. System 2 cognition is effortful (Kahneman\n2011), and most humans are \u201ccognitive misers\u201d who attempt to minimize cognitive effort (Taylor\nand Fiske 1978). Thus, we tend to adopt the conclusions of System 1, often without thought\n(Kahneman 2011). Common triggers causing us to invoke System 2 are a negative stimulus or a\nsurprise (Kahneman 2011), or a FOR that indicates conflicting results (Bago and De Neys 2017).\nThe net result is confirmation bias (Nickerson 1998). When we see new information, our\nSystem 1 automatically, and in less than one second, confirms that it matches our prior\nknowledge and we are inclined to believe it. Or, our System 1 tells us that it does not match and\nwe should not believe it (Kahneman 2011). Unless we are motivated to expend cognitive effort\nand invoke System 2, we simply accept the conclusion of System 1 with little thought\n(Kahneman 2011). And if we were to invoke System 2, how would it help us determine if a news\nstory was true? Unless we have witnessed the events in a story there is no unambiguous way to\ndetermine if the story is true or false. Thus, people are likely to accept their System 1 conclusion\nand believe information that matches pre-existing views (Allcott and Gentzkow 2017).\nConfirmation bias also affects the time taken. System 1\u2019s conclusion that new\ninformation matches our beliefs is produced in less than a second and simply accepting this takes\nlittle time. If our System 1 indicates that we should reject the new information, we are inclined to\nspend only a little longer before discarding it (Haidt 2012; Kahneman 2011). Minas et al (2014)\n\n10\nfound that in a utilitarian mindset, all pieces of information are initially considered (by System\n1), but the only factual information that matched a priori beliefs was selected for System 2\nprocessing. Similarly, Turel and Qahri-Saremi (2016) found that System 1 was linked to\nimpulsive and problematic use of social media and System 2 to more rational and controlled use.\nTwo aspects of the social media context suggest that social media may exacerbate\nconfirmation bias. First, research suggests that individuals in a hedonic mindset may be less\nlikely to critically consider information than those in a utilitarian mindset, as their consumption\nis tied to what they desire reality to be, rather than what they know to be real (Hirschman and\nHolbrook 1982). When in a hedonic mindset we are less likely to expend the cognitive effort to\ninvoke System 2, and more likely to accept System 1\u2019s biased conclusions.\nSecond, social media enables users to choose the news they like and learns their\npreferences so that it deliberately displays more articles matching their choices. This causes a\ndecreased range of information displayed on a user\u2019s newsfeed, so that the news on social media\nis often biased (The Wall Street Journal 2016). Users\u2019 realities on Facebook differ based on what\nthey read and who their friends are (The Wall Street Journal 2016). There are sharp differences\nin liberal and conservative newsfeeds, with fake news aligned with political beliefs more likely\nto be seen and shared by users in \u201cecho chambers\u201d of biased information (Bozdag and van den\nHoven 2015; Cerf 2016; Colleoni et al. 2014). This bias inundates users with news\u2014real and\nfake\u2014that supports their views (Bennett and Iyengar 2008; Knobloch\u2010Westerwick and Lavis\n2017). Such a stream of biased messages intensifies confirmation bias (Nickerson 1998).\nCreating Cognitive Dissonance\nOne approach to interrupting confirmation bias is to create cognitive dissonance by\nadding a fake news flag to false stories. Cognitive dissonance occurs when users are presented\n\n11\nwith two pieces of conflicting information that both cannot be true (Festinger 1962; Mills 1999),\nwhich in this case is a fake story users want to believe because it aligns with their a priori beliefs\nand a flag that says it is false. System 1 makes an instant judgement but the conflicting\ninformation makes this judgement difficult (Kahneman 2011); the results are unreliable and the\nFOR tells us something is amiss (Bago and De Neys 2017). This contradiction causes cognitive\ndiscomfort (Aronson 1969). The user must decide either to ignore the discomfort or invest effort\nto resolve it. If the issue is unimportant to them, users typically ignore the cognitive dissonance\nand accept what their prior beliefs say (Nickerson 1998). Otherwise, they invest effort by\ninvoking System 2 to decide which piece of conflicting information is true (Aronson 1969;\nKahneman 2011) which takes more time and requires greater cognitive activity.\nWhen System 2 goes to work to resolve the dissonance, it is influenced, sometimes very\nstrongly, by the unreliable results of System 1 (Kahneman 2011). The System 1 results are stored\nin working memory and become part of the problem space (Thompson 2013). System 2 has\nequal access to the information and System 1\u2019s unreliable result, and uses both (Thompson\n2013). Information is often ambiguous and can be interpreted in different ways (Srull and Wyer\n1979). System 2 gives more weight to System 1\u2019s result than to the facts that produced it (Srull\nand Wyer 1980; Srull and Wyer 1983). Thus, an erroneous System 1 result has greater influence\non our subsequent System 2 conclusions than the factual information (Dennis and Minas 2018).\nIn summary, we argue that placing a fake news flag on a story aligned with a user\u2019s\nbeliefs will trigger cognitive dissonance. If the dissonance is strong enough, the user will invoke\nSystem 2 and expend greater cognitive effort to consider the headline and the fake news flag.\nThe use of System 2 cognition will be indicated by the user taking more time to make a judgment\nabout whether to believe the story or not, and by cognitive activity in certain brain regions. Our\n\n12\nstudy uses the neurophysiological responses measured by EEG as an indicator of cognitive\nactivity. We focus on activity in the frontal cortex because it has been linked with cognitive\nactivity associated with what we commonly consider to be \u201cthinking\u201d: arousal, memory\nencoding, memory retrieval, insight and consciousness (Ba\u015far et al. 1999; Klimesch 2012;\nKrause et al. 2000; Minas et al. 2017; Pizzagalli 2007). The result of this System 2 cognition is a\njudgment about the credibility of the story, and we theorize that the fake news flag will reduce\ncredibility. Thus, we have three hypotheses:\nH1: Social media users will exhibit increased cognitive activity in the frontal cortex when seeing\na fake news flag on a headline aligned with their beliefs.\nH2: Social media users will spend more time when seeing a fake news flag on a headline aligned\nwith their beliefs.\nH3: Social media users will perceive headlines aligned with their beliefs that are flagged as fake\nas being less credible.\nMETHOD\nParticipants\nEighty-three undergraduates were recruited from a large business core course. All were\nexperienced with social media. Age ranged from 18 to 34 (mean 19.5) and 39% were female.\nThree reported being left-handed and since a third of left-handed people have differences in brain\nstructure, we removed all three participants from our EEG analyses.\nTask\nParticipants read 50 fact-based news headlines and assessed their credibility. The\nheadlines covered 10 topics related to US politics and were actually true or false. Forty headlines\nwere designed to be possibly true or false, though verifiably one or the other (e.g., Trump\ndefunds Planned Parenthood, minimum wage should be $21.72 to keep pace with inflation). Ten\nheadlines were controls intended to be more clearly true (e.g. Trump launches Twitter tirade;\n\n13\nHollywood celebrities oppose Trump). See Appendix A for headlines. Participants spent an\naverage of 10.5 seconds reading each headline before beginning to answer questions about it.\nTreatment\nThe experiment mimicked the Facebook display, although participants were not able to\nlike, comment, or share the story. A flag matching Facebook\u2019s fake news flag was randomly\nassigned to 20 of the 40 non-control headlines (including those actually true) (see Figure 1).\nMeasures\nThe primary behavioral dependent variable was the credibility of the headline, measured\nusing three 7-point items from Beltramini (Beltramini 1988): believability, credibility, and\ntruthfulness. The Cronbach alpha was 0.94, indicating adequate reliability.\nThe second behavioral dependent variable was the time participants took to form their\ncredibility assessment. The time was measured from the initial display of the headline until the\nparticipant clicked a button to display the credibility questions.\nThe alignment of a headline with the participant\u2019s political beliefs was coded as a binary\nvariable; headlines positively supporting the participant\u2019s beliefs were coded as a 1; headlines\nthat did not were coded as 0. We used ten sources of self-reported data to assess the extent to\nwhich a headline aligned with participants\u2019 political beliefs. The participants reported their\npolitical affiliation on a 4-point scale (Democrat, Independent leaning Democrat, Independent\nleaning Republican, and Republication), which was collapsed into either Democrat (first two\nresponses) or Republican (second two responses). They reported who they would vote for\n(Clinton or Trump) if the 2016 presidential election was held today. The election had been held\nfour to six months prior. They also answered eight items (7-point scale, with 4 as neutral)\nmeasuring their political conservatism (Everett 2013) across topics related to the headlines. Our\n\n14\nsample was fairly balanced politically, with 47% being self-reported Republicans and 53%\nDemocrats; 31% reported that they would vote for Trump at the time of the study. See Appendix\nB for more information.\nTwo raters independently matched the headlines to the single most closely matching item\nout of the ten political belief items and agreed on 46 of the 50 headlines (92%); differences were\nresolved. For example, an anti-abortion headline was matched to the anti-abortion item (with\nthose scoring 5-7 being susceptible to confirmation bias). A gun-rights headline was matched to\nthe gun-rights item. A Trump-supporting headline was matched to a Trump voter.\nChanges in cognition were measured using time-frequency analysis of EEG data. EEG is\na neurophysiological tool that enables the examination of neurophysiological changes that occur\nduring information processing on the order of milliseconds (Berger 1929). EEG measures small\nelectrical signals produced in the superficial areas of the underlying cortical regions. These\nelectrical signals form complex wave patterns at specific frequencies that are related to cognitive\nactivity. Berger\u2019s early research showed the importance of the alpha wave (originally called\n\u201cBerger waves\u201d), and its potential to indicate specific mental processes, including arousal,\nmemory and consciousness (Pizzagalli 2007).\nA 2012 review concluded that alpha-band waves (8-13Hz) indicate brain activity across\nmany brain regions (Klimesch 2012). Alpha waves have been shown to change reliably in\nresponse to stimuli (Klimesch 2012). When a region of the brain becomes active, alpha waves\ndesynchronize, leading to lower alpha levels (Cohen 1995); thus alpha wave desynchronization\nindicates higher levels of cognitive activity (Kelly et al. 2006; Klimesch 2012; Makeig et al.\n2002). The upper alpha frequency band (~10-13Hz) shows encoding memory processes in the\nparietal and frontal cortex regions (Kilner et al. 2005; Klimesch et al. 1997; Klimesch et al.\n\n15\n2001; Klimesch et al. 1996; Moretti et al. 2013).\nWe use time-frequency analysis, event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP), to analyze\nevent-related desynchronization (ERD) (Makeig 1993). It is important to note that, despite the\nsimilar acronym, time-frequency analysis (e.g., ERSP) differs from traditional event-related\npotential (i.e., ERP) studies in that it examines a frequency band (e.g., alpha wave) over a\nspecified time-period. Event-related potentials, common in cognitive neuroscience studies,\nexamine specific waveforms that occur at a specified time period (e.g., P300 is a positive spike\nin neural activity that occurs at 300 milliseconds in response to rare events). In time-frequency\nanalysis, we look for a pattern of changes (i.e., spectral changes) over a period of several\nseconds. We analyzed the last 4 seconds the participant viewed the headline to account for the\ntime participants read the headlines. The alpha frequency band was examined for significant\nalpha ERD in the 10 to 13Hz frequency band as has been suggested and done in prior research\n(Minas et al. 2014; M\u00fcller-Putz et al. 2015). See Appendix C for more details.\nWe used a 14-channel Emotiv wireless EEG device (see Figure 2). There is a concern\nthat wireless data collection may suffer from dropped packets due to interference. The data\nincludes a variable indicating if any signal loss occurred during data collection and marking\npackets that were interpolated. We removed all artifacts and interpolated data. There has been\ndebate within the cognitive neuroscience community about the validity of low-cost EEG systems\nlike Emotiv. Many studies have scrutinized the Emotiv device in a variety of settings such as,\nexamining working memory (Wang et al. 2015), auditory analysis (Badcock et al. 2013), mobile\nbrain-computer interfaces (Debener et al. 2012), detection of the P300 wave (Ram\u00edrez-Cortes et\nal. 2010; Wang et al. 2015), human-computer interaction (Taylor and Schmidt 2012), and\nhemispheric asymmetry (Friedman et al. 2015). These studies have found Emotiv to obtain a\n\n16\nreliable and valid signal of underlying cortical activity as good as larger high-density systems\nalbeit with lower spatial resolution so that the edges of regions are not as sharp and clear.\nRESULTS\nBehavioral Results\nWe used Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) to analyze the credibility and time data;\nsee Table 1. Confirmation bias is present, with participants more likely to believe headlines to be\ncredible when they aligned with the user\u2019s political beliefs (t(4150)=2.46, p=0.014). The fake\nnews flag (Flagged as False) had no effect (t(4150)=0.52, p=0.601). Surprisingly, participants\nwere more likely to believe that true headlines were less credible (t(4150)=2.45, p=.014). We\nnote that participants had difficulty assessing whether headlines were true or false; they correctly\nassessed only 44%. Participants spent 1.4 seconds longer considering a headline when the\nheadline was flagged as false (t(4150)=3.32, p=0.001), and an additional 1.9 seconds when the\nheadline was flagged as false and the headline aligned with their beliefs (t(4150)=2.45, p=0.014).\nThese results support H2 (that users take more time when seeing a fake flag on a headline\naligned with their beliefs). However, H3 was not supported: the fake news flag did not reduce the\ncredibility of headlines aligned with beliefs.\nNeurophysiological Results\nWe examined the cognition triggered by a headline that supported the participant\u2019s\nbeliefs but was flagged as being false. When a brain region is active, desynchronization of neural\nactivity in the alpha band occurs (called \u201calpha blocking\u201d) (Potter and Bolls 2012), thus event-\nrelated desynchronization (ERD) is an indicator of cognitive activity. Event-related spectral\nperturbation analysis produces a set of areas within the brain (called clusters) showing the\nlocation of ERD and whether there are significant differences between the treatments. With this\n\n17\nanalysis, the researcher does not specify which superficial layers of cortex to test (all regions are\ntested), which is a major strength of this approach; it is not limited to a priori decisions which\nmay or may not fit the reality of participant cognition. The clusters identified by the analysis may\nor may not align with the regions that the researcher has hypothesized about, and may span\nseveral distinct brain regions, making interpretation challenging. However, when a cluster\nincludes a theorized region, it is a powerful signal supporting the theory, because nothing in the\nanalysis directed the software to consider the theorized region; the region emerged from the data.\nThe challenge occurs when a cluster shows significant differences between treatments in\nregions the researcher did not theorize prior to the analysis. In this case, the researcher must\ninterpret what cognitive activity in those region(s) means. Unfortunately, there are often several\nways to interpret activity as each brain region is responsible for a complex set of disparate\nactivities (Poldrack 2011). This has been called the reverse inference problem (Poldrack 2011).\nFor researchers grounded in quantitative positivist traditions, the reverse inference\nproblem is intractable (Fischer 1970) because it is usually impossible to apply deductive\nreasoning to unequivocally produce a result (Fischer 1970). For researchers grounded in\nqualitative interpretivist methods, reverse inference is normal science using abductive reasoning\n(Dubois and Gadde 2002; Peirce 1931-1958). Abduction is a form of scientific reasoning that\nstarts with data and sorts through the possible explanations to find the most appropriate\nexplanation (Dubois and Gadde 2002; Peirce 1931-1958). Quantitative researchers routinely use\nabduction to build theory (Van de Ven 2007), so the question is not whether to use abduction,\nbut rather when to use it \u2013 before or after data collection, or both.\nWe strongly advocate for reverse inference using abduction after data collection when the\nanalysis shows significant differences in regions that were not theorized prior to data collection.\n\n18\nAfter all, what is the alternative? Ignore significant effects that were not theorized? Ignoring the\nunexpected is not good science. For us, reverse inference is not a problem; it is an opportunity\nfor discovering the unanticipated. Care must be taken in experimental design to eliminate as\nmany competing explanations as possible, and when interpreting unexpected results, we must use\nabductive reasoning to determine the most likely explanation (Poldrack 2011). Subsequent\nresearch can then theorize and test the newly discovered unexpected results for generalizability.\nOur analysis produced two neurological clusters with significant differences that suggest\nparticipants experienced cognitive dissonance. The first cluster was as hypothesized in frontal\ncortices (see Figure 3). Participants showed significantly more ERD in the frontal cortices for\nheadlines that supported their beliefs but were flagged as false. The differences are across the\nupper alpha band and are spread throughout the time period. Increased ERD in the frontal\ncortices is associated with increased cognitive activity, including arousal, memory, and\nconsciousness (Pizzagalli 2007) and arousal, memory access, and consciousness (Ba\u015far et al.\n1999; Krause et al. 2000; Pizzagalli 2007). The frontal cortices are active during deliberate\ncognitive tasks and high-order cognitive processes (Ba\u015far et al. 1999; Kilner et al. 2005;\nKlimesch et al. 1997; Klimesch et al. 2001; Klimesch et al. 1996; Krause et al. 2000; Moretti et\nal. 2013). This indicates that participants spent more cognitive activity considering headlines that\nsupported their beliefs but were flagged as false than other headlines.\nThe second cluster also shows ERD in the frontal cortices, but also includes some\nunexpected activity in the right parietal region (Figure 4). Activity in the right parietal can\nindicate encoding and retrieving a stimulus in working memory (Foxe and Snyder 2011; Gevins\net al. 1997; Mevorach et al. 2006). Increased ERD in the right parietal cortex is indicative of\ndirecting attention toward salient stimuli (Foxe and Snyder 2011; Mevorach et al. 2006), and\n\n19\nturning toward a stimulus (rather than away) (Schutter et al. 2001). It has also been linked to\nsustained attention to a stimulus being retained in working memory and encoding or retrieval of\nsemantic memory (Gevins et al. 1997; Klimesch et al. 1997; Klimesch et al. 2001). Both\ninterpretations provide a similar conclusion: individuals paid more attention to headlines\nsupporting their beliefs that were flagged as false.\nTaken together, these two clusters indicate that subjects spent more cognitive effort\nconsidering a headline that supported their beliefs but was flagged as false compared to other\nheadlines (e.g., those supporting their beliefs but not flagged, or challenging their beliefs\n(flagged or not)). This increased cognitive activity also corresponds to the increased time that\nsubjects spent on these headlines (Table 1). H3 is supported.\nPost hoc Analysis on Confirmation Bias\nWe also conducted a post hoc analysis investigating cognition in the presence of\nconfirmation bias, because past research in a different context (virtual team decision making \u2013 a\nutilitarian mindset) has found that individuals are more likely to engage in cognitive activity\nwhen they encounter information that supports their opinions and simply ignore information that\nopposes their opinions (Minas et al. 2014). The context in this study is different because social\nmedia users are in a hedonic rather than a utilitarian mindset (Chauhan and Pillai 2013). Hedonic\nand utilitarian motivation have been shown to have differential effects on confirmation bias\n(Borrero and Henao 2017; Stone and Wood 2018).\nThis post hoc analysis found increased cognitive activity in two clusters when\nparticipants saw headlines aligned with their opinions (i.e., when confirmation bias was present):\nthe frontal cortices (Figure 5a); and the right parietal and somatosensory region (Figure 5b). As\nnoted above, increased activity in the frontal cortices is linked to increased higher order\n\n20\ncognitive processes, while increased activity in the right parietal is linked to focusing attention.\nIncreased ERD in the somatosensory region has been linked to motion, planning for motion, or\ntactile sensations (Hari et al. 1998; Porro et al. 1996), which is hard to interpret in this situation.\nWe conclude that once participants realized that a headline supported their political opinions,\nthey directed their cognitive attention to the headline, but when they realized that a headline\nchallenged their opinions, they did not direct attention to it.\nDISCUSSION\nOur study examined whether a fake news flag helped social media users discern true\nnews from fake news. Our results show that the fake news flag did not influence user beliefs,\nalthough it triggered more cognition and increased the time spent considering the headline.\nInstead, users were more likely to believe news headlines they wanted to be true. Table 2\nsummarizes the results.\nThe EEG results show two interesting findings. First, in the absence of a fake news flag,\nsignificantly more event-related alpha desynchronization was observed in the frontal cortices and\nthe right parietal for headlines that supported the participant\u2019s beliefs. In other words, once\nparticipants recognized that a headline supported their beliefs, they devoted attention to it; once\nthey recognized that a headline opposed their beliefs, they did not process it further.\nSecond, when participants viewed headlines that supported their beliefs but were flagged\nas fake, cognitive dissonance occurred. The EEG results showed activation in the frontal cortices\nand right parietal, which suggests that participants engaged in additional cognition to resolve the\ncognitive dissonance. However, this additional cognition only resulted in users deciding to\ndisregard the fake news flag and believe the fake news article.\nWe see three key conclusions in our results. First, the presence of a fake news flag did\n\n21\nnot affect how participants perceived the credibility of the headlines. The time and EEG results\nindicate that the flag caused cognitive dissonance and induced participants to think more deeply\nabout the truth of the headline. However, the cognitive dissonance triggered by the flag was not\nenough to overcome participants\u2019 inherent confirmation bias; although they thought more, this\nadditional thought did not cause them to believe the headline less. The flag was simply not\nstrong enough to make users overcome their a priori beliefs. Perhaps in the era of fake news,\nusers are more likely to dismiss information that challenges their opinions as being fake. This\nfake news flag is an ineffective remedy for fake news; again, we note that Facebook discontinued\nits use in 2017 (Meixler 2017).\nSecond, confirmation bias drives beliefs. Participants were more likely to believe and\nprocess headlines that aligned with their beliefs. This likely did not result from additional\nknowledge; participants were not correct in their perceptions of truth. Rather, participants likely\nfound these topics more credible because any attempt to believe that the headlines were false\nwould result in cognitive dissonance. Rather than expend cognitive effort to consider the actual\ntruth of the article, participants rejected reality in favor of their a priori beliefs (Allcott and\nGentzkow 2017; Koriat et al. 1980; McKenzie 2006; Nickerson 1998). We confirm that social\nmedia is highly subject to confirmation bias.\nThird, the real underlying truth of the headlines had little effect on whether participants\nbelieved the headlines or not. Participants were not more likely to believe headlines that were\nverifiably true. It may be that an increased awareness of fake news may have caused participants\nto be naturally more skeptical of all headlines presented; the mean credibility score of 3.7 across\nall headlines suggests a slight bias towards skepticism.\nLimitations\n\n22\nWe began by theorizing that the context of social media is important; social media use is\noften hedonic as users browse on cell phones while waiting in line, on laptops while watching\nTV, and so on. Yet we studied use in the cold, clinical context of a lab experiment, where we\ncould carefully control exogenous factors. Ecological validity was challenged, as participants\nwere wearing an Emotiv headset, the headlines were displayed on separate pages instead of a\nscrolling homepage, and participants were not on their own social media pages. This setting may\nhave triggered a utilitarian mindset of thinking more deliberately about the headlines than the\nnormal everyday setting of social media use, perhaps weakening the effects we found. Thus, the\neffects observed in the lab may be understated; the real problem may be worse. We note that\nother studies using neurophysiological data have the same limitations (Vance et al. 2018).\nOur study also suffers from the other usual limitations of laboratory studies. Participants\nwere undergraduate students, which may not be representative of the population as a whole\n(Koriat et al. 1980). They had experience with social media, but care should be taken when\ngeneralizing to populations that may not have as much experience. The neuroanatomy of some\nyoung adults changes through their teens into their mid-20s, with neuroplasticity (i.e., changes to\nneural structures and networks) also prevalent in adulthood (Draganski et al. 2004; Sowell et al.\n1999). However, we are unaware of any studies that show systematic differences in alpha\nattenuation between young adults and adults decades older.\nAdditional limitations come from the context of fake news itself. This context is\ncontinually changing, as concerns about fake news wax and wane, types of misinformation\nchange and online social media platforms are revised in response.\nImplications for Research\nFirst and foremost, our research shows that the fake news flag triggered more cognitive\n\n23\nactivity and caused users to spend more time when the flag was placed on headlines they wanted\nto believe. However, it did not change the result of that cognition. At one level, this indicates that\nfact-checking may have promise (because it did trigger deeper cognition to resolve cognitive\ndissonance). But it may be optimistic to believe that a simple \u201cdisputed\u201d flag might trigger the\ndeep introspection needed to overcome confirmation bias and resolve cognitive dissonance.\nFuture research needs to develop and test a stronger signaling mechanism for the results of fact-\nchecking, one that might be strong enough to overcome confirmation bias. Perhaps this could be\na different flag with stronger words, or a different type of intervention altogether.\nSecond, the post-hoc analysis indicates that future research needs to understand how we\ncan overcome confirmation bias in the use of social media. Our results show that once users\nrecognize that a headline challenges their a priori beliefs, they stopped thinking about it. In other\nwords, confirmation bias is so strong in social media use that users simply stop thinking about\ninformation they don\u2019t like. We need more research on confirmation bias in social media use.\nThird, we used EEG to complement other sources of data such as self-reported data (i.e.,\nbeliefs in the headlines) and observed data (i.e., time taken), as has been advocated in the use of\nneurophysiological tools in IS research (Dimoka et al. 2012). The primary advantages of\nneurophysiological data are that they are generally not susceptible to subjectivity bias, social\ndesirability bias, and demand effects (Dimoka et al. 2012). The use of three distinct types of data\nenabled us to triangulate across the different sources to better understand the phenomenon\n(Dimoka et al. 2012). We encourage future research to consider using neurophysiological data.\nFinally, our results add to the growing list of evidence that fake news is becoming a\nmajor societal problem (House of Commons 2018; Weiss 2017). Many solutions have been\nproposed, and many pundits have offered opinions. However, we have little empirical research\n\n24\non the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of the many proffered options. We need more research on\nways to improve social media users\u2019 ability to discern truth from fiction, and more research on\nways to induce social media users to invest more time and attention in the news they see and to\nrestrain from spreading fake news without reading it (Gabielkov et al. 2016).\nImplications for Practice\nFacebook\u2019s fake news flag had no effect on beliefs. It did not induce participants to\nconclude that a news article was less credible. They spent more time when a headline they\nsupported was flagged as fake, but the flag did not change their beliefs. Perhaps more\nimportantly, the actual truth of a headline did not influence users\u2019 beliefs; users were generally\nunable to accurately separate true news from fake news. We conclude that we need to develop a\nbetter method for warning social media users of fake news.\nPeople will continue to consume news on social media and will continue to struggle to\ndetermine its truthfulness. The sheer volume of fake news on social media (Silverman 2016)\nmeans that this problem is unlike any we have seen before; \"quantity has a quality all its own.\"\n(attributed to Josef Stalin). There are real and demonstrable consequences from enabling the\nspread of posts that are verifiably false in order to spread disinformation or profit from users\u2019\ngullibility (House of Commons 2018). We believe that Facebook and other social media firms\nhave a responsibility to better enable their users to discern truth from fiction (see House of\nCommons 2018).\n\n25\nFigure 1: Fake News Flag on a Facebook Headline\nFigure 2.

Rand\n \n3,4,5,\n*\nWe synthesize a burgeoning literature investigating why people believe and share\nfalse or highly misleading news online. Contrary to a common narrative whereby\npolitics drives susceptibility to fake news, people are \u2018better\u2019 at discerning truth\nfrom falsehood (despite greater overall belief) when evaluating politically concor-\ndant news. Instead, poor truth discernment is associated with lack of careful rea-\nsoning and relevant knowledge, and the use of heuristics such as familiarity.\nFurthermore, there is a substantial disconnect between what people believe and\nwhat they share on social media. This dissociation is largely driven by inattention,\nmore so than by purposeful sharing of misinformation. Thus, interventions can\nsuccessfully nudge social media users to focus more on accuracy. Crowdsourced\nveracity ratings can also be leveraged to improve social media ranking algorithms.\nToward a Psychology of False and Misleading Online News\nFabricated news is nothing new. For example, in 1835 The Sun newspaper in New York\npublished six articles about purported life on the moon which came to be known as the 'Great\nMoon Hoax'. During the 2016 US Presidential Election and UK Brexit Referendum, however, a\ndifferent form of fake news (see Glossary) rose to prominence (Box 1): false or highly misleading\npolitical 'news' stories, primarily originating on social media [1]. Concern about fake news was\nredoubled in 2020 in the face of widespread misinformation and disinformation [2] on social\nmedia about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [3] and the 2020 US Presidential\nElection [4]. Misleading hyperpartisan news, as well as yellow journalism [5], are related forms\nof problematic news content that are likely sources of political polarization [6]. What is it about\nhuman psychology \u2013 and its interaction with social media [7,8] \u2013 that explains the failure to distin-\nguish between accurate and inaccurate content online? Apart from being of theoretical\ninterest, this question has practical consequences: developing effective interventions against mis-\ninformation depends on understanding the underlying psychology.\nWe focus here primarily on online content that is presented in the form of news articles. However,\nfalse and misleading claims come in many forms, and there are several literatures that are clearly\nrelated, but outside the scope of our review (although we will draw some connections throughout).\nThese include work on conspiracy belief [9], superstition [10], rumors [11], bullshit receptivity [12],\nand misperceptions [13], among others. Furthermore, our focus is on individual examples of misinfor-\nmation, and not on organized disinformation campaigns (e.g., by the Russian Internet Research\nAgency, or campaigns relating to global warming or fraud in the 2020 US Presidential Election).\nWhy Do People Fall for Fake News?\nWhen considering the factors that may influence what people believe, it is essential to distinguish\nbetween two fundamentally different ways to conceptualize belief in true and false news. One\ncommon approach is to focus on truth \u2018discernment\u2019, or the extent to which misinformation is\nbelieved \u2018relative\u2019 to accurate content. Discernment, typically calculated as belief in true news\nminus belief in false news (akin to 'sensitivity' or d' in signal detection theory [14]) captures the\n\u2018overall\u2019 accuracy of one's beliefs \u2013 and thus gives insight into failures to distinguish between\ntrue and false content ('falling for fake news').\nHighlights\nRecent evidence contradicts the com-\nmon narrative that partisanship and\npolitically motivated reasoning explain\nwhy people fall for 'fake news'.\nPoor truth discernment is linked to a\nlack of careful reasoning and relevant\nknowledge, as well as to the use of\nfamiliarity and source heuristics.\nThere is also a large disconnect between\nwhat people believe and what they will\nshare on social media, and this is largely\ndriven by inattention rather than by\npurposeful sharing of misinformation.\nEffective interventions can nudge social\nmedia users to think about accuracy,\nand can leverage crowdsourced veracity\nratings to improve social media ranking\nalgorithms.\n1\nHill/Levene Schools of Business,\nUniversity of Regina, Regina, SK S4S\n0A2, Canada\n2\nDepartment of Psychology, University\nof Regina, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada\n3\nSloan School of Management,\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology,\nCambridge, MA 02142, USA\n4\nInstitute for Data, Systems, and Society,\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology,\nCambridge, MA 02142, USA\n5\nDepartment of Brain and Cognitive\nSciences, Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA\n*Correspondence:\ngordon.pennycook@uregina.ca\n(G.

This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\nTrends in\nCognitive Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\n\nAnother approach is to focus on overall belief, or the extent to which news \u2013 regardless of its\naccuracy \u2013 is believed (calculated as the average or sum of belief in true news and belief in\nfalse news, akin to calculating 'bias' in signal detection theory [14]). Critically, factors that\nalter overall belief need not impact people's ability to tell truth from falsehood [15]: increasing or de-\ncreasing belief in true and false headlines to an equivalent extent has no effect on the overall\naccuracy of one's beliefs (i.e., does not affect truth discernment).\nPolitical Motivations\nA popular narrative is that the failure to discern between true and false news is rooted in political mo-\ntivations. For example, it has been argued that people are motivated consumers of (mis)information\n[16] \u2013 that they engage in 'identity-protective cognition' when faced with politically valenced content,\nand this leads them to be overly believing of content that is consistent with their partisan identity and\noverly skeptical of content that is inconsistent with their partisan identity [17]. A related theory argues\nthat people place loyalty to their political identities above the truth \u2013 and thus fail to discern truth from\nfalsehood in favor of simply believing ideologically concordant information [18]. These accounts con-\ntend that a strong causal influence of political motivation on belief is thus the dominant factor\nexplaining why people fall for fake news.\nIt is clearly true that partisanship is associated with overall belief: People are more likely to believe\nnews content that is concordant (versus discordant) with their political partisanship [19\u201325]\n(Figure 1B). It is important to note, however, that the effect of political concordance is typically\nmuch smaller than that of the actual veracity of the news [20,21,26]. In other words, true but\nGlossary\nAlgorithm: steps or calculations\nperformed by a computer (given a set of\nrules) to solve a problem or complete a\ntask.

Unlike\ndisinformation, misinformation does not\nnecessarily need to be created\ndeliberately to mislead. Misinformation is\nsometimes used to refer exclusively to\ninaccuracies that are accidental;\nhowever, because it is difficult to\nascertain the intentions of the unknown\nindividuals who create falsehoods that\nspread on the internet, we use\nmisinformation as a broader umbrella\nterm here (i.e., much of the content used\nin the studies we discuss could be\nclassified as disinformation and/or\nhyperpartisan news and/or propaganda,\netc.).\nYellow journalism: content from\nnewspapers, magazines, or websites\nthat is poorly researched and\nsensationalist, and that is created with\nthe goal of increasing sales or, on the\ninternet, clicks. Roughly equivalent to\ntabloid journalism.\nBox 1. Prevalence of Fake News\nVarious analyses of social media and web browsing data have been used in an attempt to determine the prevalence of fake\nnews, often with a focus on the 2016 US Presidential Election. For example, using web browsing data, archives of fact-\nchecking websites, and a survey, Allcott and Gentzkow [19] estimated that a particular set of news stories that are known\nto be false were shared on Facebook at least 38 million times in the 3 months leading up to the 2016 election (30 million of\nwhich were for news favoring Donald Trump). This estimate represents a lower bound since it only reflects that specific set\nof known false news.\nOther analyses have focused on fake news publishers (i.e., websites) rather than on individual articles. Based on data from\nTwitter [117], Facebook [77,118], and web browsing [89], these studies concluded that content from known fake news\nsites represents a small proportion of most people's media diets, and that the average social media user was exposed\nto little fake news during the 2016 election.\nThese analyses have important limitations, however, because the only available data concern what people are sharing and\nwhat they visit when they click through to visit news sites off-platform. But, of course, the vast majority of the time that peo-\nple are exposed to news on social media, they simply read the post without sharing it or clicking on the link to visit the ac-\ntual source website. Furthermore, so-called 'fake news' only represents one category of misinformation, and misleading\ncontent from sources such as hyperpartisan news websites likely represents a much larger proportion of people's media\ndiets [6,119]. Thus, the actual on-platform exposure of the average user to misinformation remains an open question [120].\nWe feel it is premature to conclude that exposure rates are minimal, and thus that false and misleading news online is not a\nproblem (also [7,8]). This is especially true when looking beyond the 2016 election because new misinformation threats \u2013\nsuch as false claims about COVID-19 [3,44] and fraud in the 2020 US Presidential Election [4] \u2013 have gained widespread\ntraction through amplification by (mostly Republican) political elites.\nAccordingly, exposure to fake news (and misinformation more broadly) is not equally distributed across all users. In\nparticular, political conservatives and older adults were far more likely to visit fake news websites or share fake news\narticles during the 2016 Presidential Election [19,89,117,118]. Studies have also found associations between political\nconservatism and belief in misinformation in the USA [20,44], Chile [121], and Germany [122], but not in Hungary [24],\nand users who engage in less reasoning have been found to share content from lower-quality news sites on Twitter\n[71]. Thus, even if it was true that the average social media user was not exposed to that much misinformation, exposures\nrates are substantially higher in subpopulations that may be particularly vulnerable to believing inaccurate content. Finally,\nmisinformation that originates on social media sometimes transitions to much larger audiences when it is picked up by\ntraditional media outlets \u2013 either via direct repetition or debunking (which may result in inadvertent amplification).\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences \nOPEN ACCESS\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences, May 2021, Vol. 25, No. 5 389\n\npolitically discordant news is typically believed much more than false but politically concordant\nnews \u2013 politics does not trump truth. Furthermore, greater overall belief in politically consistent\nnews does not necessarily indicate politically motivated reasoning. Such differences could\neven arise from unbiased rational (e.g., Bayesian) inference built on prior factual beliefs that\nTrendsTrends inin CognitiveCognitive SciencesSciences\nFigure 1. Political Concordance and Cognitive Reflection Have Divergent Relationships with Belief. Reasoning\n(or lack thereof) is much more strongly related to truth discernment than is political concordance, whereas political concordance\nis much more strongly related to overall belief than is reasoning. Data from 14 studies [20,21,26,34,35,41,49,61,84,93] in which\nUS participants were asked to rate the accuracy of actual news posts from social media (headlines equally balanced true versus\nfalse, as well as Democrat-consistent versus Republican-consistent). Study names are indicated by the first author's last initial\nand publication date, followed by a dash and study number for multistudy papers; the number of participants in each study is\nindicated under the name. Data from all 14 studies are pooled to calculate the 'All' values. (A) Difference in truth discernment\n(belief in true news minus belief in false news) between participants who scored higher on the Cognitive Reflection Test relative\nto those who scored lower (median split; collapsing over headline political concordance) and between headlines that were\npolitically concordant relative to politically discordant (collapsing over participant cognitive reflection). More-reflective participants\nwere more discerning than less-reflective participants, and discernment was higher for politically concordant headlines than for\npolitically discordant headlines. Critically, the difference based on reasoning was roughly twice as large as the difference based\non partisanship. (B) Difference in overall belief (average of belief in true news and belief in false news) between participants who\nscored higher on the Cognitive Reflection Test relative to those who scored lower (median split; collapsing over headline political\nconcordance), and between headlines that were politically concordant relative to politically discordant (collapsing over participant\ncognitive reflection). More-reflective participants had a somewhat lower overall belief than less-reflective participants, whereas\noverall belief was higher for politically concordant headlines than for politically discordant headlines.

Greater overall belief in\npolitically concordant news might seem to suggest that people are more inaccurate when\nassessing politically concordant news \u2013 in other words, that political concordance (and the asso-\nciated motivations) interferes with truth discernment. In fact, the data reveal the opposite pattern:\nPeople are somewhat better at discerning truth from falsehood when judging politically concor-\ndant news compared with politically discordant news (Figure 1A). Taken together, the\nevidence therefore suggests that political identity and politically motivated reasoning are not the\nprimary factors driving the inability to tell truth from falsehood in online news.\nReasoning\nAnother perspective on the (in)ability to differentiate between truth and falsehood comes from the\nfield of reasoning. Work in this vein has a particular focus on dual-process theories stipulating that\nanalytic thinking can override automatic, intuitive responses (Box 3 for details). The key question\nthis perspective asks is \u2013 what is the role of reflective reasoning in the ability to discern fake\nnews from truth?\nOne potential answer, which follows from the earlier-referenced work on political identity, argues\nthat deliberative ('System 2') reasoning is often motivated by political identity, and that people\nBox 2. Challenges in Identifying Politically Motivated Reasoning\nThe observation that people are more likely to believe information that is consistent with their political ideology/partisanship\n(and are less likely to believe information that is inconsistent with their ideology/partisanship) is often taken as evidence for\npolitically motivated reasoning [22,123,124]. Critically, however, this pattern does not actually provide clear evidence of\npolitically motivated reasoning because partisan identity is likely confounded with other relevant variables [27,125]. Most\nnotably, partisans differ in what they believe about the world, even when it comes to so-called 'factual beliefs' \u2013 beliefs that\nrelate to facts or empirical evidence [28], such as in the case of global warming [126]. This is critical because a large body of\nevidence from entirely nonpolitical contexts shows that what people believe to be true about the world influences their\nreasoning (a phenomenon known as belief bias [127]). Indeed, once prior beliefs are accounted for, the apparent impact\nof political concordance on processes of belief formation is typically greatly reduced or eliminated [28,29,128]. Thus,\nobserving a difference across ideological lines is not sufficient evidence to conclude that partisan identity or political mo-\ntivations are themselves responsible for the difference [27,125].\nTo clearly disentangle the impact of partisan identity or motivations versus prior beliefs, further experimental work is\nneeded \u2013 for example, studies that manipulate prior factual beliefs and/or political motivations [27,30]. Relatedly, under-\nstanding the origins of partisan differences in prior factual beliefs is also of the utmost importance. Exposure to different\ninformation streams is a promising candidate: entirely rational (e.g., Bayesian) and truth-seeking (i.e., nonpolitically\nmotivated) people who obtain their information from conservative (e.g., Fox News) versus liberal (e.g., MSNBC) news\nsources would naturally wind up with very different factual beliefs about the world. Evaluating new information in light of\nhow well it aligns with one's priors \u2013 although often referred to as 'confirmation bias' \u2013 is not, in fact, necessarily evidence\nof bias in a normative sense. When there is uncertainty about the reliability of information sources or data-generating pro-\ncesses, it can be entirely consistent with Bayesian inference to be skeptical of information that is inconsistent with one's\nprior factual beliefs [30,129]. In such cases, Bayesian agents may infer that the source or the data-generating process\nis unreliable rather than that their prior belief was incorrect \u2013 and doing so would not be evidence of bias per se (where bias\nis defined as deviating from some normative, e.g., Bayesian, benchmark) [130].\nFinally, the critique described in this box also applies to inferring 'motivated System 2 reasoning' from the observation that\ncognitive sophistication is sometimes (but not always or even frequently [131\u2013133]) associated with polarization rather\nthan accuracy [17]. The association between cognitive sophistication and polarization (e.g., in the context of climate\nchange) disappears entirely once prior factual beliefs are accounted for [28]. Instead, it appears that more cognitively so-\nphisticated individuals may place more weight on their prior factual beliefs when evaluating new evidence, instead of plac-\ning more weight on concordance with their political identities. Of course, people's prior factual beliefs may themselves be\ncaused by politically motivated reasoning \u2013 but they need not be, and most study designs cannot determine (but must as-\nsume) a causal connection.\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences \nOPEN ACCESS\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences, May 2021, Vol. 25, No. 5 391\n\nengage in 'identity protective cognition' [16]. This account predicts that engaging in more\ndeliberation should lead to more politically polarized beliefs \u2013 and, most importantly, to greater\nbelief in politically concordant but false claims. Thus, more deliberation should be associated\nwith worse truth discernment.\nBy contrast, more 'classical' reasoning accounts (i.e., accounts that are more consistent with\nwork on dual-process reasoning in other domains) portray System 2 reasoning as being respon-\nsible for correcting faulty intuitions (Box 3). This perspective therefore predicts that people who\ndeliberate more will simply be less likely to believe false content \u2013 and are better able to discern\nbetween true and false content \u2013 regardless of the political concordance of the news that they\nare evaluating.\nAcross numerous recent studies, the evidence supports the classical reasoning account over the\nmotivated System 2 reasoning account. People who are more reflective (Box 3) are less likely to\nbelieve false news content \u2013 and are better at discerning between truth and falsehood \u2013 regardless\nof whether the news is consistent or inconsistent with their partisanship [20,26,34,35] (Figure 1A).\nThe same pattern is evident with respect to discernment between biased and misleading\nhyperpartisan news and true (mainstream) news [35] and when judging full news stories as\nopposed to just headlines [36], and using measures beyond the Cognitive Reflection Test\n(Figure 1), such as thinking disposition questionnaires [34] and the Berlin Numeracy Test [35]. Belief\nin fake news is also associated with delusionality [34], dogmatism [34], religious fundamentalism\n[34], bullshit receptivity [37], and overclaiming [37] (all factors associated with analytic thinking;\nBox 3). Furthermore, experimentally manipulating participants' level of deliberation demonstrates\na causal effect whereby deliberation reduces belief in false (but not true) news, regardless of\npartisan alignment (and has no effect on polarization) [26]. Research also shows that\noverconfidence may contribute to susceptibility to false information [38], perhaps because it\nstops people from slowing down and engaging in reflective reasoning [39,40].\nHow, then, do people determine news veracity? The correlation between cognitive reflection and\ndisbelief in fake news is stronger in cases where the content is more obviously implausible (and\nvice versa for true news) [20]. This suggests that, in cases where people actually do stop and\nthink, relevant prior knowledge is likely to be a critical factor. Indeed, political knowledge is\npositively associated truth discernment for political news content [23,41], as is media literacy\n[42] and general information literacy [43]. Similarly, basic science knowledge is positively asso-\nciated with truth discernment for (mis)information about COVID-19 [44]. This implies, unfortu-\nnately, that reasoning may not improve accuracy in contexts where prior knowledge is heavily\nBox 3. Dual-Process Models of Reasoning and the Consequences of Deliberation\nDual-process theories are a core component of research on the cognitive science of reasoning. These theories argue\nthat human cognition can be partitioned into two fundamentally different types of processes that differ in terms of their\ncharacteristics [40,134,135]: Type 1 (or System 1) processing that is characterized primarily by automaticity such that\nType 1 outputs ('intuitions') come to mind directly as a response to the stimulus, and Type 2 (or System 2) processing that\nis characterized by the deliberation that may or may not arise given a particular intuitive output (or set of outputs).\nConsider the following problem from the Cognitive Reflection Test [136]: 'A bat and ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs\n$1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?' The incorrect intuitive answer \u2013 10 cents \u2013 comes to mind\nintuitively for most people, whereas the correct answer \u2013 5 cents \u2013 emerges (for most) only with an additional deliberation\nprocess [137]. Performance on tasks such as the Cognitive Reflection Test are associated with a wide range of beliefs and\nbehaviors [138], including actual social media behaviors observed on Twitter ([71]; also [109]), as well as conspiracy idea-\ntion [139], politics [140], bullshit receptivity [12], and endorsement of a variety of epistemically suspect beliefs [138]. Impor-\ntantly, although dual-process theories typically emphasize the importance of overriding incorrect intuitions via analytic\nthinking, this should not be taken to imply that intuitions are always incorrect or that analytic thinking is always accurate [135].\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\n392 Trends in Cognitive Sciences, May 2021, Vol. 25, No. 5\n\ndistorted (e.g., by partisan media consumption or misinformation campaigns by political elites \u2013\nclimate change being a prime example) [28] (Box 2).\nThus, when it comes to the role of reasoning, it seems that people fail to discern truth from false-\nhood because they do not stop to reflect sufficiently on their prior knowledge (or have insufficient\nor inaccurate prior knowledge) \u2013 and not because their reasoning abilities are hijacked by political\nmotivations.\nHeuristics\nPrior work in judgment and decision making [45] indicates that people are likely to use heuristics\nor mental shortcuts when judging news headlines. What, then, are the specific features of fake\nnews that influence people's intuitions or cause them to make mistakes when reasoning?\nOne key route to intuitive belief in news is familiarity [37]. The influence of prior exposure on\njudgments of truth \u2013 sometimes referred to as the illusory truth effect \u2013 is well documented\n[46,47]. Indeed, wartime rumors during WWII that were more familiar were more likely to\nbe believed [48]. Consistent with this, a single prior exposure to a fake news headline increases\nlater belief in the headline [49,50]. Remarkably, this is evident even if the headline is extremely\nimplausible (also [51]) and inconsistent with one's political partisanship [49]. Thus, feelings of famil-\niarity and, possibly, processing fluency per se ([52,53]; (but see [54]) likely contributes to increased\nbelief in false claims.\nThe source is another important cue that may be used when evaluating news. Participants are\nmore likely to believe information provided by people whom they view as being credible (reviewed\nin [55]), and a large literature from political science has robustly demonstrated the impact of elite\nmessaging, in particular, on public opinion [56]. For example, attributing a false claim to President\nTrump increased Trump supporters' belief in the claim while reducing Democrats' belief in the\nclaim [57]. Furthermore, social feedback provided by social media platforms (e.g., 'likes') also\nincreases belief in news content, particularly for misinformation [58] \u2013 a factor that is likely to\ncovary with elite messaging (given that political elites, such as Presidents and people in Congress\nor the media, often have many social media followers).\nFinally, a salient feature of fake news headlines also seems to be that they are often emotionally\nevocative. That is, fake news is often geared toward provoking shock, fear, anger [8,59], or (more\nbroadly) moral outrage [60]. This is important because people who report experiencing more emo-\ntion (positive or negative) at the outset of the task are more likely to believe false (but not true) news;\nand instructing people to rely on emotion increases belief in false (but not true) headlines [61].\nBelieving versus Sharing Fake News\nOne might expect that people share news on social media because they believe it is true.\nAccordingly, the widespread sharing of false content is often taken as evidence of widespread\nfalse beliefs [62,63]. However, recent work has shown that social media sharing judgments can\nactually be quite divergent from judgments about accuracy [21,44]. For example, participants\nwho were asked about the accuracy of a set of headlines rated true headlines as much more\naccurate than false headlines; but, when asked whether they would share the headlines, verac-\nity had little impact on sharing intentions \u2013 both in the context of political headlines [21]\n(Figure 2A) and headlines about COVID-19 [44]. As a result, sharing intentions for false head-\nlines were much higher than assessments of their truth (e.g., 91% higher in Figure 2A), indicat-\ning that many people were apparently willing to share content that they could have identified as\nbeing inaccurate.\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences \nOPEN ACCESS\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences, May 2021, Vol. 25, No. 5 393\n\nTo shed light on this disconnect between accuracy judgments and sharing intentions, a recent\nstudy examined the impact of asking participants to rate the perceived accuracy of each headline\nimmediately before deciding whether they would be willing to share it on social media [21]. This\nexperiment helps to distinguish between three distinct explanations for the accuracy\u2013sharing\ndissociation. The confusion-based account posits that people genuinely (but mistakenly) believe\nthat the false claims they share are probably true. Consistent with this proposal, of the false\nheadlines that were shared in the baseline condition of [21], 33% were both believed and shared\nwhen participants were asked directly about accuracy \u2013 however, this leaves the remaining 67%\nof sharing unexplained by confusion.\nThe preference-based account is rooted in the idea that people place their preference for\npolitical identity (or related motives such as virtue signaling [64]) above the truth, and thus\nshare politically consistent false content on social media despite recognizing that it is probably\nnot true. This purposeful sharing could be motivated, for example, by an effort to further one's\npolitical agenda [18], to sow chaos [65], or to share news that would be interesting if it turned\nTrendsTrends inin CognitiveCognitive SciencesSciences\nFigure 2. Social Media Sharing Does\nNot Necessarily Imply Belief, and\nAccuracy Prompts Improve the\nQuality of Content That People\nShare. \n(A) Data from study 1 in [21]\nwhere US participants (n = 1002) from\nAmazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) judged\npolitical headlines. Participants were\npresented with a set of headlines and\nwere either asked to indicate whether\nthey thought the headlines were accurate\n(accuracy condition) or whether they\nwould consider sharing them on social\nmedia (sharing condition). Although\nparticipants were much more likely to\nrate true headlines versus false headlines\nas being accurate in the accuracy\ncondition, headline veracity had little\nimpact on sharing intentions in the\nsharing condition (i.e., there was an\ninteraction between condition and\nveracity, b = \u22120.50, t(18089) = \u221215.37,\nP = <0.001). Error bars indicate\n95% confidence intervals. (B) Data\nfrom study 7 in [21] where Twitter users\n(n = 5379) who had recently shared links\nto websites that regularly produce\nmisleading and hyperpartisan content\nwere sent an unsolicited message asking\nthem to rate the accuracy of a single nonpolitical headline. The news sites to which users retweeted links in the 24 h after\nreceiving the message were compared with the links retweeted by participants who had not yet received the message\n(and the date of message delivery was randomized to allow causal inference). The x axis indicates the trust score given to\neach outlet by eight professional fact-checkers. The y axis indicates the fraction of rated links to each outlet in the 24 h\nafter the intervention minus the fraction of links to each outlet among not-yet-messaged users. The size of each dot is\nproportional to the number of premessaging posts with links to that outlet. Domains with >500 premessaging posts are\nlabeled. As can be seen, the message significantly improved the quality of new sources shared, with the change in\nrelative tweet frequency being strongly related to fact-checker ratings (domains weighted by number of pretreatment\nposts; r(52) = 0.74, P = <0.001).

Of the false headlines that were shared in the baseline condition of [21],\n16% of the headlines were shared despite being identified as inaccurate. Thus, although pur-\nposeful sharing occurs, it seems unlikely to explain the bulk of false or misleading content that\nis shared online.\nFinally \u2013 and most consistent with the earlier focus on a lack of reflective thinking being a source of\nmisjudgments \u2013 the inattention-based account argues that people have a strong preference\nto only share accurate content, but that the social media context distracts them from this\npreference. Consistent with this account, asking participants to rate the accuracy of each head-\nline before deciding whether to share it decreased sharing of false headlines by 51% relative to the\nbaseline condition [21] \u2013 suggesting that inattention to accuracy was responsible for roughly half\nof the misinformation sharing in the experiment.\nIn a similar vein, work on social media behavior often emphasizes the importance of the\n'attention economy' where factors relating to engagement (likes, shares, comments, clicks,\netc.) are selected for in social media environments [8,60,67\u201369]. Accordingly, sharing of\nlow-quality news content on Facebook is associated with ideological extremity [70] and\nideological concordance is a much stronger predictor of sharing than it is of belief [21].\nFurthermore, analytic thinking is not only associated with more truth discernment, as de-\nscribed earlier, but is also associated with having more discerning sharing intentions in survey\nexperiments (both in terms of false [35,44] and hyperpartisan content [35]) and with the actual\nsharing of more reliable news outlets on Twitter [71]. One striking possibility is that the social\nmedia context itself distracts people from prioritizing the truth when they decide what to\nshare \u2013 and, in some cases, may actively promote antisocial behavior [72] and hamper the ex-\nercise of analytic and critical thinking. Social media may be both a cause and a consequence\nof increased political engagement, both good and bad [73].\nWhat Can Be Done? Interventions To Fight Fake News\nWe now turn to the implications of these findings for interventions intended to decrease the\nspread and impact of online misinformation.\nCurrent Approaches for Fighting Misinformation\nAs social media companies are, first and foremost, technology companies, a common\napproach is the automated detection of problematic news via machine learning, natural lan-\nguage processing, and network analysis [74\u201376]. Content classified as problematic is then\ndown-ranked by the ranking algorithm such that users are less likely to see it. However,\ncreating an effective misinformation classifier faces two fundamental challenges. First, truth is\nnot a black-and-white, clearly defined property: even professional fact-checkers often disagree\non how exactly to classify content [77,78]. Thus, it is difficult to decide what content and\nfeatures should be included in training sets, and artificial intelligence approaches run the risk\nof false positives and, therefore, of unjustified censorship [79]. Second, there is the problem\nof nonstationarity: misinformation content tends to evolve rapidly, and therefore the features\nwhich are effective at identifying misinformation today may not be effective tomorrow.\nConsider, for example, the rise of COVID-19 misinformation in 2020 \u2013 classifiers trained to\ndetect largely political content were likely unequipped to be effective for novel false and\nmisleading claims relating to health.\nAnother commonly used approach involves attaching warnings to content that\nprofessional fact-checkers have found to be false (reviewed in [80,81]). A great deal of ev-\nidence indicates that corrections and warnings do successfully reduce misperceptions\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences \nOPEN ACCESS\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences, May 2021, Vol. 25, No. 5 395\n\n[41,81\u201383] and sharing [49,84,85]. Despite some early evidence that correction checking\ncould backfire and increase belief in false content [86], recent work has shown that\nthese backfire effects are extremely uncommon and are not a cause for serious concern\n[87,88].\nThere are, however, other reasons to be cautious about the sufficiency of professional fact-checking.\nMost importantly, fact-checking is simply not scalable \u2013 it typically requires substantial time and effort\nto investigate whether a particular claim is false or misleading. Thus, many (if not most)\nfalse claims never get fact-checked. Even for those claims that do eventually get flagged, the\nprocess is often slow, such that warnings are likely to be absent during the claim's period of\npeak viral spreading. Furthermore, warnings are typically only attached to blatantly false\nnews, and not to extremely misleading or biased coverage of events that actually\noccurred. In addition to straightforwardly undermining the reach of fact-checks, this sparse\napplication of warnings could lead to an 'implied truth' effect where users may assume that\n(false or misleading) headlines without warnings have actually been verified [84]. Fact-checks\noften also fail to reach their intended audience [89], and may fade over time [90], provide\nincomplete protection against familiarity effects [49], and cause corrected users to\nsubsequently share more low-quality and partisan content [91].\nAnother potential approach that is commonly referenced is emphasizing the publishers of news\narticles, seeking to leverage the reliance on source cues described earlier. This, in theory, could\nbe effective because people (at least in the USA) are actually fairly good at distinguishing between\nlow- and high-quality publishers [92]. However, experimental evidence on emphasizing news\npublishers is not very encouraging: Numerous studies find that making source information\nmore salient (or removing it entirely) has little impact on whether people judge headlines to be\naccurate or inaccurate [37,93\u201397] (although see [98,99]).\nNew Approaches for Fighting Misinformation\nOne potentially promising alternative class of interventions involve a more proactive 'inoculation'\nor 'prebunking' against misinformation [8,100]. For example, the 'Bad News Game' uses a\n10\u201320 minute interactive tutorial to teach people how to identify fake news in an engaging way\n[101]. An important limitation of such approaches is that they are 'opt in' \u2013 that is, people have\nto actively choose to engage with the inoculation technique (often for a fairly substantial amount\nof time \u2013 at least in terms of the internet attention span [102]). This is particularly problematic\ngiven that those most in need of 'inoculation' against misinformation (e.g., people who are low\non cognitive refl\nection) may be the least likely to seek out and participate in lengthy inoculations.\nLighter-touch forms of inoculation that simply present people with information that helps them to\nidentify misinformation (e.g., in the context of climate change [103]) may be more scalable. For\nexample, presenting a simple list of 12 digital media literacy tips improved people's capacity to\ndiscern between true and false news in the USA and India [104].\nBoth fact-checking and inoculation approaches are fundamentally directed toward improving\npeople's underlying knowledge or skills. However, as noted earlier, recent evidence indicates\nthat misinformation may spread on social media not only because people are confused or\nlack the competency to recognize fake news, but also (or even mostly) because people fail\nto consider accuracy at all when they make choices about what to share online [21,44]. In\naddition, as mentioned, people who are more intuitive tend to be worse at distinguishing\nbetween true and false news content, both in terms of belief (Figure 1A) and sharing\n[35,71]. This work suggests that interventions aimed at getting people to slow down and\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\n396 Trends in Cognitive Sciences, May 2021, Vol. 25, No. 5\n\nreflect about the accuracy of what they see on social media may be effective in slowing the\nspread of misinformation.\nIndeed, recent research shows that a simple accuracy prompt \u2013 specifically, having partici-\npants rate the accuracy of a single politically neutral headline (ostensibly as part of a pre-\ntest) before making judgments about social media sharing \u2013 improves the extent to\nwhich people discern between true and false news content when deciding what to share\nonline in survey experiments [21,44]. This approach has also been successfully deployed\nin a large-scale field experiment on Twitter, in which messages asking users to rate the\naccuracy of a politically neutral news headline were sent to thousands of accounts who recently\nshared links to misinformation sites [21]. This subtle prompt significantly increased the quality of\nthe new they subsequently shared (Figure 2B). Furthermore, survey experiments have shown that\nasking participants to explain how they know whether a headline is true or false before sharing it\nincreases sharing discernment [105], and having participants rate accuracy at the time of encoding\nprotects against familiarity effects [106]. Relatedly, metacognitive prompts \u2013 probing questions that\nmake people reflect \u2013 increases resistance to inaccurate information [107].\nA major advantage of such accuracy prompts is that they are readily scalable. There are\nmany ways that social media companies, or other interested parties such as governments\nor civil society organizations, could shift people's attention to accuracy (e.g., through ads,\nby asking about the accuracy of content that is shared, or via public service announce-\nments, etc.). In addition to scalability, accuracy prompts also have the normative advantage\nof not relying on a centralized arbiter to determine truth versus falsehood. Instead, they\nleverage users' own (often latent) ability to make such determinations themselves, preserving\nuser autonomy. Naturally, this will not be effective for everyone all of the time, but it could have a\npositive effective in the aggregate as one of the various tools used to combat misinformation.\nFinally, platforms could also harness the power of human reasoning and the 'wisdom\nof crowds' to improve the performance of machine-learning approaches. While professional\nfact-checking is not easily scalable, it is much more tractable for platforms to have large\nnumbers of non-experts rate news content. Despite potential concerns about political bias\nor lack of knowledge, recent work has found high agreement between layperson crowds\nand fact-checkers when evaluating the trustworthiness of news publishers: the average\nDemocrat, Republican, and fact-checker all gave fake news and hyperpartisan sites very\nlow trust ratings [92] (Figure 3A). This remained true even when layperson raters were told\nthat their responses would influence social media ranking algorithms, creating an incentive to\n'game the system' [108]. However, these studies also revealed a weakness of publisher-based\ncrowd ratings: familiarity with a publisher was necessary (although not sufficient) for trust,\nmeaning that new or niche publishers are unfairly punished by such a rating scheme. One\nsolution to this problem is to have laypeople rate the accuracy of individual articles or\nheadlines (rather than publishers), and to then aggregate these item-level ratings to create\naverage scores for each publisher (Figure 3B). Furthermore, the layperson ratings of the\narticles themselves are also useful. Analyzing a set of headlines flagged for fact-checking\nby an internal Facebook algorithm found that the average layperson accuracy rating for fairly\nsmall crowds correlated equally well with that of professional fact-checkers as the fact-checkers\ncorrelated with each other [77]. Thus, using crowdsourcing to add a 'human in the loop' element\nto misinformation detection algorithms is promising.\nThese observations about the utility of layperson ratings have a strong synergy with the afore-\nmentioned idea of prompts that shift users' attention to accuracy: periodically asking social\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences \nOPEN ACCESS\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences, May 2021, Vol. 25, No. 5 397\n\nTrendsTrends inin CognitiveCognitive SciencesSciences\n(See figure legend at the bottom of the next page.)\nTrends in Cognitive Sciences\nOPEN ACCESS\n398 Trends in Cognitive Sciences, May 2021, Vol. 25, No. 5\n\nmedia users to rate the accuracy of random headlines both (i) shifts attention to accuracy and\nthus induces the users to be more discerning in their subsequent sharing, and (ii) generates useful\nratings to help inform ranking algorithms.\nConcluding Remarks\nThe spread of misinformation online presents both a scientific puzzle and a practical challenge.\nThe research we have synthesized here shows that the common narrative, whereby failing to\ndifferentiate false or misleading news from truth is a symptom of political polarization in a 'post-\ntruth' world, is not an appropriate characterization. Although people do preferentially believe\nnews that aligns with their politics, this occurs as much or more for true headlines compared\nwith false headlines \u2013 and thus people are actually more accurate, not less, when judging\nheadlines that are politically concordant. Rather than being bamboozled by partisanship, people\noften fail to discern truth from fiction because they fail to stop and reflect about the accuracy of\nwhat they see on social media. Accordingly, simple prompts that shift people's attention to\naccuracy increase the quality of news that people share on social media. Approaches of this na-\nture, including providing digital literacy tips, are not hindered by the same issues of scalability\nrelated to strict fact-checking approaches \u2013 and, in fact, can be combined with crowd-\nsourced fact-checking to maximize efficiency. Human reasoning, when applied appropriately,\ncan be a powerful salve against the lure of misinformation. Nonetheless, numerous important\nquestions remain unanswered (see Outstanding Questions).\nThere is also much to be gained for psychology and cognitive science per se from inves-\ntigating online misinformation. Fake news and other forms of online misinformation repre-\nsent a powerful (and ecologically valid) testing ground for evaluating theories from cognitive,\nsocial, and political psychology. More so than many other domains, when studying fake\nnews and misinformation it is often possible to combine traditional laboratory experiments\nwith large-scale social media data [71,109] \u2013 or even to conduct actual field experiments\non-platform [21,110,111]. Furthermore, these topics also motivate theory development\nby highlighting a new class of problems in need of further explanation: only a small fraction\nof online content draws sufficient attention and interest to be shared on social media. Under-\nstanding the psychology that underpins the dynamics of social media sharing is an important\nemerging subfield in psychology [21,67,112] (in addition to other areas such as computer\nscience [76], political science [113], communication [114], and public health [115], among\nothers [116]), driven in large part by concerns about misinformation. Tackling these questions\nOutstanding Questions\nWhat are the impacts of exposure to\nmisinformation? How does exposure\naffect belief in the specific claims made\nin the misinformation, more general\nattitudes (e.g., support for political\ncandidates or policies), and relevant\nbehaviors (e.g., vote choice or health\nbehaviors)? Do these effects differ\nfor misinformation versus reliable\nnews? How much misinformation\nmust be encountered to shift atti-\ntudes, beliefs, and behaviors?\nDoes the design of social media\nplatforms actively promote the spread\nof misinformation? For example, by\ninducing distraction and incentivizing\nor directing attention to factors other\nthan veracity?\nHow do times of crisis (e.g., the COVID-\n19 pandemic) affect susceptibility to\nmisinformation and the dynamics of\nsocial media behavior?\nTo what extent do findings about\nmisinformation and social media from\nthe USA and other Western countries\ngeneralize to other cultures and other\nsocial contexts (e.g., messaging apps\nsuch as WhatsApp)?\nWhat are the similarities and\ndifferences between the psychology\nof online misinformation relative to\nrelated constellations of beliefs, such\nas conspiracy ideation, political\nmisperceptions, rumors, and bullshit?\nHow does the psychology of\nonline misinformation compare with\nmisinformation distributed by traditional\nmedia such as television and talk radio,\nor by political elites?\nHow will findings about current forms\nof misinformation generalize in the\nface of the continually evolving nature\nof online content?\nWill social media corporations be willing\nto invest in, and implement, major\nchanges to fight misinformation, given\nthat their business models are premised\non maximizing engagement? How can\nadvocates and policy makers most\neffectively incentivize them to do so?\nHow can academics and social\nmedia platforms collaborate to study\nmisinformation, given the platforms\nFigure 3. The Wisdom of Crowds Can Help To Illuminate Information Quality. (A) Data from study 2 of [92] in which\nUS participants (n = 970) from Lucid indicated their level of trust in 60 news publishers. Average trust ratings for each source\namong Democrats (Dems; x axis) and Republicans (Reps; y axis) are shown. Although some partisan differences are evident\n(e.g., Republicans trust Fox News more than any other publisher), all hyperpartisan and fake news sites received low average\ntrust ratings from members of both parties. Thus, when creating a politically balanced layperson rating by averaging trust from\nDemocrats and Republicans, every mainstream outlet scores higher than every fake news or hyperpartisan outlet; in addition,\nthe layperson ratings were highly correlated with ratings of professional fact-checkers: r(58) = 0.90, P = <0.001. (B) Data from\nstudy 4 of [93] in which US participants (n = 1008) from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) provided accuracy ratings for the\nheadlines of the 10 most-popular articles from a range of fake news, hyperpartisan, and mainstream accounts. Shown is a\nlayperson outlet-quality score, constructed by averaging the accuracy ratings for the 10 headlines from each outlet, on\nthe y axis, plotted against the rating assigned to each outlet by NewsGuard, a company that hires professional journalists\nto conduct detailed investigations of the quality of news outlets, on the x axis.

While fabrications and falsehoods are not new phenomena, the emergence of social media and digital networks has intensified the creation and circulation of misleading content often packaged in the format of news reports and articles (Lazer et al., 2018). This tidal wave of misinformation has been enabled by the capacities of digital media technologies along with the economic and political complexities of the current media landscape. The resulting \u201cinfodemic\u201d has come to pose grave threats for journalism as an institution, governance and policymaking, as well as the very fabric of democratic deliberation that underpins the idea of an informed public (Bakir & McStay, 2017).  \n\nGiven the intricate social dynamics involved, a multidisciplinary effort is required to comprehend and respond to the challenges of fake news and the post-truth condition. Communication and media scholars have made important contributions through frameworks explicating the changing nature of digital networks, information disorders, and the crisis plaguing legacy journalism. However, nuanced sociological perspectives are vital as well to highlight the vulnerabilities in the modern information ecosystem and trace the collective processes that normalize the circulation of misinformation. As C.W. Mills (1959) emphasizes, sociological imagination enables linking individual troubles to broader public issues by locating personal experiences in their sociohistorical contexts. Adopting this orientation, the current paper aims to elucidate the sociology of fake news and unpack the social forces and configurations that have facilitated the rise of misinformation across digital cultures. \n\nBackground\n\nFundamentally, the contemporary fake news phenomenon indicates a crisis in practices of knowledge production, gatekeeping, and verification that once preserved the reliability of information. News, as a validated form of knowledge, maintains its authority through disciplinary norms that uphold principles of truthfulness and objectivity (Hallin, 1994). This disciplinary matrix breaks down in case of fake news, which mimics the aesthetic form of news articles but is divorced from journalistic commitments to factual accuracy. Instead, fake news exaggerates, distorts, or wholly fabricates information to deliberately advance certain ideological agendas and influence beliefs (Mantzarlis, 2018). It propagates false narratives that feed into a fragmented and polarized climate of opinions, often intensifying existing social divisions.\n\nWhile elements of propaganda, misinformation, and yellow journalism have shadowed the news industry historically, the current infodemic of fake news is traced to the ascendance of social media, declining public trust in established media, increased political polarization, and the economic troubles facing journalism organizations (Carlson, 2017; Coleman, 2018). This combination of technological, political, economic and cultural factors constitutes the broader ecology that sociological analysis seeks to unpack in relation to fake news. In particular, the socially constructed nature of \u2018news\u2019 itself must be highlighted to appreciate what makes the phenomenon of fake news socially disruptive. \n\nTheoretical Groundings\n\nSociological insights draw attention to the institutional moorings of concepts like credibility, facticity, and journalistic authority (Schudson, 2001). Facts do not emerge in isolation but are produced through disciplinary frameworks that distinguish truth claims from falsehood. News, in this sense, is not a naturally occurring category but a stabilized construct rooted in professional norms and gatekeeping practices (Becker & Vlad, 2009). When these supports erode, the lines demarcating news from non-news contents become obscured. Three sociological lenses illuminate how such blurring unfolds and troubles previously entrenched classifications.\n\nCritical theory highlights connections between knowledge and power (Agger, 2006). Formation of public consciousness through media discourses is linked to dominant ideological frameworks that perpetuate existing social hierarchies. Spread of misinformation can be interpreted as symptomatic of efforts by influential actors to shape constituencies through divisive rhetoric and messaging (Fuchs, 2017). Online networks marked by virality and opacity readily lend themselves to such top-down opinion manipulation.\n\nSymbolic interactionism focuses on microsocial processes of meaning-making (Blumer, 1986). Shared social realities emerge from everyday discourses, interpretive exchanges, and communications between situated individuals (Berger & Luckmann, 1966). Fake news gains traction by assimilating into contexts of meaning construction on digital platforms, message boards, and social conversations.\n\nSystems theory adopts a macro level view focusing on relationships between different social subsystems (Luhmann, 2012). Information disorders result from variances between media, technology, politics and other subsystems with limited capacities for self-correction. Fake news thrives in fragmented environments with weakened gatekeeping. \n\nPrior Research   \n\nSeveral studies have yielded useful sociological insights regarding fake news. Focusing on media structures, researchers find that legacy outlets are struggling to adapt older practices to social media environments allowing misinformation to flourish (Carlson, 2017). Analyses also reveal how economic imperatives in digital capitalism incentivize attention-grabbing content over factual rigor, enabling fake news models to take off (Bell & Owen, 2017). Investigations into online echo chambers argue that social media creates polarized spaces where users consume ideologically aligned content, limiting exposure to alternative views (Quattrociocchi et al., 2016). Examinations of online political talk track the crystallization of counter-publics through fake news sharing practices (Reuters Institute, 2018). At a micro level, concepts like information laundering show how rumors gain credibility through diffusion across networks (Marwick & Lewis, 2017). Together these studies provide a rich sociological description of the complex dynamics involved in normalization of fake news.\n\nHowever, reviews note that existing research tends to adopt a technologically deterministic orientation (Guo & Vargo, 2018). Greater attention is needed to the agency of various stakeholders, interpretive capacities of audiences, and socially embedded character of digital platforms. Moreover, studies largely focus on discrete cases like elections, neglecting the broader infodemic. Advancing sociological understanding calls for research that moves beyond transient political events toward long-range analysis of developments reconstituting contemporary information ecosystems. \n\nProposed Methodology\n\nA mixed methods framework can support a sociological research program on fake news. First, a qualitative study involving in-depth interviews with media professionals will gather data on the structural shifts facing legacy journalism. Semi-structured conversations will examine changes in business models, gatekeeping roles, and epistemic cultures under social media dominance. The goal is to detail how institutional journalistic practices are being reworked and unpack perceptions regarding fake news.\n\nSecond, a large-scale social survey will map public attitudes and behaviors related to news consumption on digital platforms. Measuring variables like social media usage, attitudes to media, sharing habits, and views on fake news will derive insights into how people negotiate increasingly complex information environments. Statistical analysis of patterns can uncover relationships between variables situating fake news concerns in everyday contexts.\n\nFinally, computational techniques will analyze trace data to model fake news flows and political polarization on social media. Social network analysis will visually map diffusion of stories across platforms and users. Complexity metrics will gauge the presence of echo chambers and homogeneous clusters in online political talk. This method enables studying collective processes crucially involved in propagation of fake news.\n\nThe integrated findings from these complementary studies will facilitate strong triangulation and theorizing key sociological factors involved in rising misinformation. As Davies (2019) notes, the essential task is to link micro level disorder in the information ecology to broader institutional and cultural changes remaking epistemic practices across public life. The proposed research will provide important empirical footholds toward this synthesis.\n\nExpected Contributions  \n\nWhile the phenomenon of fake news has attracted substantial scholarly attention, comprehensive sociological accounts remain scarce. This study will help address this gap and further illuminate the intersectional dynamics that have both triggered and propelled the proliferation of misinformation on digital networks. The rise of fake news is neither technologically determined nor politically orchestrated alone. Rather it indexes a climate of uncertainty and crisis in institutions of knowledge production engendered through the complex interplay of various social currents. The proposed research will unravel these currents and their pressure points. Building predictive models of fake news impact can also support interventions to improve media literacy and curb false narratives.  \n\nConclusion\n\nThe virality of misinformation gestures toward widening fissures in the modern social imaginary and its anchoring epistemic frameworks. As political passions escalate and technological change accelerates, preserving spaces for credible public discourse becomes imperative. Developing sociological understandings of fake news provides a window into the reconstitution of knowledge cultures underway and can inform regulatory and educational responses. Moving forward, strengthening verification capacities and foregrounding ethics of civic deliberation are crucial to heal increasingly fractured information environments. Tracking the sociology of fake news thus sheds light on deeper challenges of community, identity and meaning construction facing contemporary public life.\n\nReferences\n\nAgger, B. (2006).

Adopting this orientation, the current paper aims to elucidate the sociology of fake news and unpack the social forces and configurations that have facilitated the rise of misinformation across digital cultures. \n\nTo situate the problem, we begin by discussing the historical backdrop and outlining key developments that constitute the contemporary context of fake news. Next, we present dominant theoretical lenses in sociology that can inform analysis of information disorders and collective processes involved in spread of misinformation. After reviewing relevant prior research, we propose a multi-pronged methodological strategy combining computational techniques, surveys, and interviews to derive insights into sociological factors shaping fake news. We then outline expected contributions of the proposed program in furthering understandings of intersections between media structures, economic interests, political currents, and cultural shifts that have normalized circulation of misleading content today. Finally, we consider broader implications and policy directions suggested by adoption of a sociological perspective focused on locating fake news concerns within wider crises of knowledge production and verification plaguing institutional life.\n\nBackground\n\nThe contemporary fake news phenomenon indicates a crisis in practices of knowledge production, gatekeeping, and verification that once preserved the reliability of information. News, as a validated form of knowledge, maintains its authority through disciplinary norms that uphold principles of truthfulness and objectivity (Hallin, 1994). This disciplinary matrix breaks down in case of fake news, which mimics the aesthetic form of news articles but is divorced from journalistic commitments to factual accuracy. Instead, fake news exaggerates, distorts, or wholly fabricates information to deliberately advance certain ideological agendas and influence beliefs (Mantzarlis, 2018). It propagates false narratives that feed into a fragmented and polarized climate of opinions, often intensifying existing social divisions. \n\nWhile elements of propaganda, misinformation, and yellow journalism have shadowed the news industry historically, the current infodemic of fake news is traced to the ascendance of social media, declining public trust in established media, increased political polarization, and the economic troubles facing journalism organizations (Carlson, 2017; Coleman, 2018). Online platforms like Facebook and Twitter, with their infrastructures for rapid information sharing, have emerged as dominant venues for news distribution and consumption. However, their algorithmic logics promote viral emotionally-charged content over factual rigor, creating fertile grounds for propagation of misinformation (Vaidhyanathan, 2018). \n\nAt the same time, growth of networked digital media has destabilized business models that supported credible journalism in the past. As advertising revenues shifted online, print newspaper circulation declined precipitously, forcing cutbacks in investigative reporting and fact-checking capacities in legacy outlets (Bell & Owen, 2017). These economic pressures substantially disrupted journalistic workflows and norms, even as social media facilitated explosion of alternative news sources of varying quality. Market dynamics rewarding speed and clickbait enabled fake news publishers mimicking credentials of legitimate newsrooms to reap profits from online ad systems (Allcott & Gentzkow, 2017). \n\nThe resulting churn in the media industry coincided with diminishing public trust in mainstream news organizations, which opened pathways for partisan outlets peddling misinformation. Only 32% of Americans expressed trust in the mass media in 2017, down from 72% in 1976 (Swift, 2016). This trust divide widened along ideological lines, with 89% of Democrats finding mainstream media credible compared to 42% of Republicans (Swift, 2016). The rightwing in particular turned against establishment journalism, embracing alternative partisan sites and fake news providers aligning with conservative worldviews (Benkler et al., 2017). \n\nThese intersecting technological, political, economic and cultural shifts provided fertile conditions for proliferation of misinformation, propaganda and conspiracy rhetoric as legitimate counter-knowledge (Farkas & Schou, 2018). By appropriating stylistic and rhetorical markers of news reporting while amplifying falsehoods, fake news publishers took advantage of wider disruptions in journalistic knowledge systems to gain traction. Their capacity to trigger virality using social media networks ensured wide exposure to misinformation packaged as news reports.\n\nKey Definitional Debates \n\nBefore elaborating upon explanatory frameworks, it is important to outline debates regarding terminology in this domain which has bearing on sociological analysis. A multiplicity of overlapping concepts like propaganda, misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories have arisen around fake news, reflecting definitional instability (Wardle, 2017). Misinformation refers to spreading of false information, irrespective of motives. Disinformation specifically denotes deliberate dissemination of falsehoods to cause reputational or civic harm. Propaganda focuses on messaging in furtherance of political interests, which may involve both truthful and misleading claims (Jack, 2017). \n\nThese categories overlap since the reliability and motives behind fake news are ambiguous, with creators leveraging anonymity afforded by internet architecture. Researchers caution against restricting fake news to solely partisan misinformation, given the plurality of inaccurate content circulating today (Tandoc et al., 2017). At the same time, depending on how stringently \u201cfakery\u201d is conceptualized, overly expansive definitions risk diluting analytical utility of the concept (Tandoc et al, 2018). As Lazer et al. (2018) emphasize, definitional boundaries are crucial since the phenomenon of fake news emerges precisely from obfuscation of norms and formats distinguishing media content from non-media forms. \n\nBuilding on this, we conceptualize fake news as misleading content packaged to mimic credible news reports and capitalize on their institutional legitimacy, while remaining detached from practices that confer epistemic validity on journalism. This retaining of stylistic facade without organizational commitment to truth-seeking that characterizes news work is what sociologically marks out fake news as destabilizing force. Through this lens, we can examine collective processes that enable misinformation to flow under the veneer of news.\n\nTheoretical Groundings\n\nSociological insights draw attention to the institutional moorings of concepts like credibility, facticity, and journalistic authority (Schudson, 2001). Facts do not emerge in isolation but are produced through disciplinary frameworks that distinguish truth claims from falsehood. News, in this sense, is not a naturally occurring category but a stabilized construct rooted in professional norms and gatekeeping practices (Becker & Vlad, 2009). When these supports erode, the lines demarcating news from non-news contents become obscured. Three sociological lenses illuminate how such blurring unfolds and troubles previously entrenched classifications.\n\nCritical theory highlights connections between knowledge and power (Agger, 2006). Formation of public consciousness through media discourses is linked to dominant ideological frameworks that perpetuate existing social hierarchies. Spread of misinformation can be interpreted as symptomatic of efforts by influential actors to shape constituencies through divisive rhetoric and messaging (Fuchs, 2017). Online networks marked by virality and opacity readily lend themselves to such top-down opinion manipulation. Critical perspectives thus connect fake news to wider questions of ideology, political economy, and cultural hegemony.\n\nSymbolic interactionism focuses on microsocial processes of meaning-making (Blumer, 1986). Shared social realities emerge from everyday discourses, interpretive exchanges, and communications between situated individuals (Berger & Luckmann, 1966). Fake news gains traction by assimilating into contexts of meaning construction on digital platforms, message boards, and social conversations. This lens illuminates how collective sense-making enables spread of misinformation.\n\nSystems theory adopts a macro level view focusing on relationships between different social subsystems (Luhmann, 2012). Information disorders result from variances between media, technology, politics and other subsystems with limited capacities for self-correction. Fake news thrives in fragmented environments with weakened gatekeeping. Systemic analysis examines points of resonance and disjuncture between institutional domains implicated in news production and verification processes. \n\nTogether these perspectives train analytical attention on intersections between macro structures, institutional practices, collective meaning-making and micro social interactions that sociologically anchor fake news as a disruptive informational genre. They foreground examining immediate technological affordances enabling misinformation in relation to broader shifts in institutional logics and intermediation processes governing flows of knowledge, rhetoric and opinion in the networked public sphere. Next we review relevant studies exemplifying empirical research along these lines.\n\nPrior Research   \n\nSeveral studies have yielded useful sociological insights regarding fake news, charting out directions for further inquiry. Focusing on media structures, researchers find that legacy outlets are struggling to adapt older practices to social media environments allowing misinformation to flourish (Carlson, 2017). Journalistic norms of gatekeeping, fact-checking and editorial oversight decay across participatory digital networks (Bro & Wallberg, 2014). This erosion of traditional media logics created openings for alternative partisan sites peddling misinformation. Analyses also reveal how economic imperatives in digital capitalism incentivize attention-grabbing content over factual rigor, enabling fake news models to take off (Bell & Owen, 2017). Metrics of engagement and popularity structurally privilege viral falsehoods over careful reporting on online networks.\n\nInvestigations into online echo chambers argue that social media creates polarized spaces where users consume ideologically aligned content, limiting exposure to alternative views (Quattrociocchi et al., 2016). These homogenized clusters reinforced through algorithms and social ties foster conditions for misinformation consistency with users\u2019 partisan identities to thrive, protected from rebuttal or fact-checking. Examinations of online political talk track the crystallization of counter-publics through fake news sharing practices, as oppositional interpretations of events circulate across fragmented networks (Reuters Institute, 2018).  \n\nAt a micro level, concepts like information laundering show how rumors gain credibility through diffusion across networks (Marwick & Lewis, 2017). Initial exposure in disparate platforms lends a patina of plausibility that influences perceptions when stories reverberate through social media. This demonstrates the collective construction of aura of credibility enabling fake news spread. Together these studies provide a rich sociological description of the complex dynamics involved in normalization of misinformation across hybrid media settings.\n\nHowever, reviews note that existing research tends to adopt a technologically deterministic orientation, ascribing agency directly to platforms (Guo & Vargo, 2018). Greater attention is needed to the interpretive capacities of audiences, institutional constraints shaping technology effects, and material cultures intersecting with digital architectures. Boczkowski (2020) also critiques the tendency to construct fake news as wholly novel phenomenon enabled by social media, arguing for examining continuities with propaganda and rumors throughout modern history. Moreover, studies largely focus on discrete cases like elections, neglecting the broader infodemic. \n\nAdvancing sociological understandings calls for research that moves beyond transient political events toward long-range analysis of developments reconstituting contemporary information ecosystems. This demands engaging with underlying shifts in cultural authority, expertise and trust dynamics that destabilized journalistic knowledge sources while opening pathways for partisan misinformation. Linking institutional changes to micro processes of meaning-making and identity construction around fake news remains a vital task. Our proposed methodology details a strategy toward this synthesis.\n\nProposed Methodology\n\nWe adopt a mixed methods framework combining computational techniques, surveys, and qualitative interviews to generate multi-perspectival insights into sociological factors shaping fake news. This strategy aligns with calls for integrating digital trace data analysis with ethnographic approaches to study hybrid media dynamics (Lokot & Diakopoulos, 2016). First, a qualitative study involving in-depth interviews with media professionals will gather data on the structural shifts facing legacy journalism. Semi-structured conversations will examine changes in business models, gatekeeping roles, and epistemic cultures under social media dominance. The goal is to detail how institutional journalistic practices are being reworked and unpack perceptions regarding fake news. We plan interviews with around 40 journalists and editors across newspapers, magazines, television, radio and digital native outlets.\n\nSecond, a large-scale social survey will map public attitudes and behaviors related to news consumption on digital platforms. Measuring variables like social media usage, attitudes to media, sharing habits, and views on fake news will derive insights into how people negotiate increasingly complex information environments. Statistical analysis of patterns using regression modeling can uncover relationships between variables like media trust, platform ideologies and misinformation beliefs, situating fake news concerns in everyday contexts. The survey will gather responses from a national probability sample of 1000 participants representative of key socio-demographic segments.\n\nFinally, computational techniques will analyze Twitter data to model fake news diffusion and political polarization. Hypotheses about increased circulation of misinformation across partisan communities will be tested by mapping propagation of stories using network analysis. Text mining methods and stance detection will visualize clusters in political discourse related to controversial public events. This digital trace data analysis will provide concrete evidence regarding flow of fake news through online networks.\n\nThe integrated findings from these complementary components will facilitate strong triangulation and theorizing key sociological factors involved in rising misinformation across hybrid media settings. As Chadwick (2017) notes, the essential task is to link macro level disorder in the information ecology to shifting cultures of knowledge and expertise that destabilized journalistic authority while opening pathways for partisan misinformation. The proposed research will provide important empirical footholds toward this synthesis.\n\nExpected Contributions  \n\nWhile the phenomenon of fake news has attracted substantial scholarly attention, comprehensive sociological accounts remain scarce. This study will help address this gap and further illuminate the intersectional dynamics that have both triggered and propelled the proliferation of misinformation on digital networks. The rise of fake news is neither technologically determined nor politically orchestrated alone. Rather it indexes a climate of uncertainty and crisis in institutions of knowledge production engendered through the complex interplay of various social currents \u2013 transforming media structures, platformization, economic disruption, diminishing trust in credentialed expertise, increased political partisanship and polarization etc. The proposed research will unravel these currents and their pressure points. \n\nFirst, interview data will provide textured understanding of how journalistic roles and epistemologies are being reformulated as technologies restructure information flows. Moving beyond deterministic accounts, this will detail how platform affordances interact with persisting professional commitments to shape gatekeeping practices and norms. Second, the survey will derive statistical models evaluating correlations between media attitudes and vulnerability to fake news, situating the phenomenon in relation to perceptional shifts regarding institutional credibility. Finally, social network analysis and text mining will yield novel datasets demonstrating spread of misinformation through online communities. \n\nTogether these findings can drive theorizing key mechanisms involved in normalization of misleading partisan content and identify leverage points for intervention. Building predictive models of fake news impact can also support interventions to improve media literacy and curb false narratives. Increased sociological awareness regarding collective dynamics enabling fake news is imperative to restore trust in credentialed knowledge sources and strengthen capacities for verification.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe virality of misinformation across hybrid media environments today gestures toward widening fissures in the modern social imaginary and its anchoring epistemic frameworks. The onslaught of fabricated falsehoods disguised as newsindexes an ongoing deinstitutionalization of communicative norms and genres that once upheld boundaries distinguishing information from disinformation. As political passions escalate and technological change accelerates, preserving spaces for credible public discourse becomes imperative. Developing sociological understandings of fake news provides a window into the reconstitution of knowledge cultures underway and can inform regulatory and educational responses. \n\nThis paper outlined key debates, theories and studies charting directions for robust sociological inquiry into misinformation spread. Three main conclusions emerge from our analysis. First, the phenomenon of fake news must be situated in relation to broader institutional transformations remaking media structures, journalistic practices and public communication ecologies today. Second, examining the normalization of misinformation demands multi-perspectival analyses engaging with technological, economic, political and cultural currents that configure the contemporary information ecosystem. Finally, strengthening verification capacities and foregrounding ethics of civic deliberation is crucial to heal increasingly fractured public spheres.

While fabrications and falsehoods are not new phenomena, the emergence of social media and digital networks has intensified the creation and circulation of misleading content often packaged in the format of news reports and articles (Lazer et al., 2018). This tidal wave of misinformation has been enabled by the capacities of digital media technologies along with the economic and political complexities of the current media landscape. The resulting \u201cinfodemic\u201d has come to pose grave threats for journalism as an institution, governance and policymaking, as well as the very fabric of democratic deliberation that underpins the idea of an informed public (Bakir & McStay, 2017).  \n\nGiven the intricate social dynamics involved, a multidisciplinary effort is required to comprehend and respond to the challenges of fake news and the post-truth condition. Communication and media scholars have made important contributions through frameworks explicating the changing nature of digital networks, information disorders, and the crisis plaguing legacy journalism. However, nuanced sociological perspectives are vital as well to highlight the vulnerabilities in the modern information ecosystem and trace the collective processes that normalize the circulation of misinformation. As C.W. Mills (1959) emphasizes, sociological imagination enables linking individual troubles to broader public issues by locating personal experiences in their sociohistorical contexts. Adopting this orientation, the current paper aims to elucidate the sociology of fake news and unpack the social forces and configurations that have facilitated the rise of misinformation across digital cultures. \n\nTo establish the background, the paper will begin by defining fake news and delineating its scope as a construct. A discussion of the major sociological theories that can illuminate fake news follows, along with a review of relevant prior research. The subsequent sections detail the proposed mixed methods research framework incorporating qualitative interviews, surveys, and computational techniques. The expected contributions of the study toward advancing sociological understanding of fake news are highlighted next. Finally, the conclusion reflects on the importance of locating fake news concerns within the deeper epistemic and institutional changes reshaping contemporary information environments.\n\nBackground\n\nFundamentally, the contemporary fake news phenomenon indicates a crisis in practices of knowledge production, gatekeeping, and verification that once preserved the reliability of information. News, as a validated form of knowledge, maintains its authority through disciplinary norms that uphold principles of truthfulness and objectivity (Hallin, 1994). This disciplinary matrix breaks down in case of fake news, which mimics the aesthetic form of news articles but is divorced from journalistic commitments to factual accuracy. Instead, fake news exaggerates, distorts, or wholly fabricates information to deliberately advance certain ideological agendas and influence beliefs (Mantzarlis, 2018). It propagates false narratives that feed into a fragmented and polarized climate of opinions, often intensifying existing social divisions.\n\nWhile elements of propaganda, misinformation, and yellow journalism have shadowed the news industry historically, the current infodemic of fake news is traced to the ascendance of social media, declining public trust in established media, increased political polarization, and the economic troubles facing journalism organizations (Carlson, 2017; Coleman, 2018). This combination of technological, political, economic and cultural factors constitutes the broader ecology that sociological analysis seeks to unpack in relation to fake news. In particular, the socially constructed nature of \u2018news\u2019 itself must be highlighted to appreciate what makes the phenomenon of fake news socially disruptive. \n\nDefining Fake News\n\nSeveral definitions have been proposed to conceptualize fake news, each emphasizing certain attributes. Wardle (2018) delineates seven types of information disorders ranging from satire and parody to fabricated content and manipulated visuals. Lazer et al. (2018) constrain fake news as \u201cfabricated information that mimics news media content in form but not in organizational process or intent\u201d (p. 1094). It styled to resemble legitimate news but arises from sources lacking standard editorial norms and mechanisms for verification. \n\nThis definition suits the present analysis as it captures both the mimicry involved as well as the breakdown of disciplinary safeguards. Fake news borrows the outward aesthetic forms of news journalism but lacks its epistemic essence nurtured through professional gatekeeping practices. As a category, fake news overlaps to some extent with related concepts like misinformation, defined as false or inaccurate content without any deliberate intent to mislead; and disinformation, or false information purposefully circulated to deceive audiences (Fallis, 2014). However, fake news stands somewhat apart as a fabricated artifact mimicking news media structures. It is specifically the hijacking of news formats to propagate falsehoods that necessitates deeper interrogation. \n\nWhile the contemporary alarm around fake news is largely traced to events surrounding the 2016 U.S. elections, investigations find that it has circulated widely on social media platforms across national contexts and languages (Vosoughi et al., 2018). Both the content and reach of fake news are highly diverse spanning conspiracy theories, manipulated photos and videos, as well as propaganda around political and non-political issues. As such, the present paper adopts a broad view encompassing different manifestations that appropriate news media vehicles and codes for intentional disinformation. Having outlined this scope, we can situate fake news within relevant sociologicaltheory to trace its embeddedness in wider structures.\n\nTheoretical Groundings\n\nSociological insights draw attention to the institutional moorings of concepts like credibility, facticity, and journalistic authority (Schudson, 2001). Facts do not emerge in isolation but are produced through disciplinary frameworks that distinguish truth claims from falsehood. News, in this sense, is not a naturally occurring category but a stabilized construct rooted in professional norms and gatekeeping practices (Becker & Vlad, 2009). When these supports erode, the lines demarcating news from non-news contents become obscured. Three sociological lenses illuminate how such blurring unfolds and troubles previously entrenched classifications.\n\nCritical theory highlights connections between knowledge and power (Agger, 2006). Formation of public consciousness through media discourses is linked to dominant ideological frameworks that perpetuate existing social hierarchies. Spread of misinformation can be interpreted as symptomatic of efforts by influential actors to shape constituencies through divisive rhetoric and messaging (Fuchs, 2017). Online networks marked by virality and opacity readily lend themselves to such top-down opinion manipulation. The lack of structural curbs allows fake news to be deployed as an instrument of propaganda by political and corporate entities seeking to consolidate discursive power.\n\nSymbolic interactionism focuses on microsocial processes of meaning-making (Blumer, 1986). Shared social realities emerge from everyday discourses, interpretive exchanges, and communications between situated individuals (Berger & Luckmann, 1966). Fake news gains traction by assimilating into contexts of meaning construction on digital platforms, message boards, and social conversations. Through repetitive circulation and embedding in familiar cultural frames, fake news shapes collective sense-making and becomes entangled with lived social worlds.\n\nSystems theory adopts a macro level view focusing on relationships between different social subsystems (Luhmann, 2012). Information disorders result from variances between media, technology, politics and other subsystems with limited capacities for self-correction. Fake news thrives in fragmented environments with weakened gatekeeping. It exploits deficits in the functional differentiation between institutional domains like media, business, and government. \n\nThese three overlapping lenses orient the analysis toward different planes \u2013 from micro interactions to meso institutions and macro environments. Their synthesis provides a multilevel account situating fake news within broader processes of power consolidation, meaning creation, and system deformation. Next we review some key studies that have yielded relevant sociological insights.\n\nPrior Research\n\nSeveral studies have generated useful sociological perspectives on fake news phenomena. Focusing on media structures, researchers find that legacy outlets are struggling to adapt older practices to social media environments allowing misinformation to flourish (Carlson, 2017). Indepth interviews reveal how journalistic norms of verification and editorial oversight are strained on digital networks enabling unchecked propagation of falsehoods (Coleman, 2018). \n\nPolitical economy analyses also show how the economic imperatives of digital capitalism incentivize attention-grabbing content over factual rigor, providing fertile ground for fake news models to succeed (Bell & Owen, 2017). Klinger and Svensson (2014) detail the \u201cviral logic\u201d that drives content designed purely to generate high click rates, unconcerned with its truth value or social effects. Financial struggles facing journalism outfits as advertising shifts online have further eroded gatekeeping around quality, catalyzing fake news (Carlson, 2018). \n\nInvestigations into online echo chambers argue that social media creates polarized spaces where users consume ideologically aligned content, limiting exposure to alternative views (Quattrociocchi et al., 2016). This fragmentation along partisan lines allows fake news to readily spread among constituencies already sharing similar worldviews. Studies mapping Twitter networks during elections find distinct right and left-wing clusters with little overlap (Boutet et al., 2013).\n\nExaminations of online political talk track the crystallization of counter-publics through fake news sharing practices (Reuters Institute, 2018). Fake news assimilation in subcultures espousing conspiracy ideologies or extreme positions enables solidification of such stances. Sharing validates belief and cements group solidarity and identity, even when claims are patently dubious.\n\nComputational research analyzes trace data to model the reach of fake news stories and sources through temporal dynamics and network topologies. Analyses show that falsehoods often outpace the spread of true stories, diffusing rapidly through social ties (Vosoughi et al., 2018). Factors like novelty, emotional appeal, and similarities to urban legends promote virality of misinformation over time (Kumar & Shah, 2018).\n\nAt a micro level, concepts like information laundering demonstrate how rumors gain credibility through diffusion across peer networks on platforms like Facebook (Marwick & Lewis, 2017). Repeated circulation interweaves fake news into everyday discourses and familiar frames of reference, normalizing its presence. Mainstreaming confers a sheen of plausibility and makes fake news difficult to debunk.\n\nTogether these studies provide rich sociological insights into the forces propelling fake news phenomena from micro interactions to macro structures. However, reviews note that much research tends toward a technologically determinist orientation emphasizing how platform architectures and algorithms enable false amplification (Guo & Vargo, 2018). Greater attention to the interpretive work of audiences and experiential contexts of digital media use can elucidate why users engage with fake news despite its questionable veracity (Coleman, 2018). Moreover, the focus on discrete political events like elections restricts perspective; long range historical analysis illuminating broader institutional shifts is vital but uncommon (Carlson, 2018). Advancing sociological understanding calls for studies that move beyond transient episodes toward explicating the foundational reconstructions remaking contemporary information ecosystems.\n\nProposed Methodology\n\nA mixed methods research framework can facilitate a robust sociological examination of fake news. First, an in-depth qualitative study involving interviews with media professionals will gather rich insights into the structural shifts facing journalism as an institution. Semi-structured conversations with editors, tech executives, and reporters will probe how traditional newsroom cultures and practices are being reconfigured in digital environments. The goal is to detail how changes in business models, flows of information, and gatekeeping patterns precipitated by social media laid the ground for proliferation of fake news. Interview accounts can provide revealing perspectives on when and how professional norms started to weaken and boundaries around news blurred from the view of those most invested. \n\nSecond, a quantitative study involving analysis of large-scale social survey data will derive insights into public attitudes and behaviors related to online news consumption. The Reuters Digital News Report incorporating samples from multiple countries provides extensive measurements of variables like frequency of social media use for news, attitudes to media credibility, prevalence of sharing behaviors, and exposure to fake news that can be statistically examined for patterns (Newman et al., 2018). Techniques like regression modeling will uncover relationships between variables like media trust and sharing habits. Segmentation analysis of user types based on consumption behaviors can generate personas with distinct orientations to online news. Triangulating these findings across diverse national populations will offer comparative purchase on the social dynamics involved.\n\nFinally, computational research will analyze trace data to model fake news diffusion through tracking temporal trajectories and network relationships. Twitter archives enable gathering large datasets encompassing millions of posts and users. Social network mapping can visually represent the propagation of particular stories through overlapping communities over time (Freelon et al., 2020). Text analysis of frequently occurring themes can uncover discourse patterns associated with fake news sharing practices. Simulation of information cascades using epidemiological models can shed light on viral dynamics and influential nodes amplifying misinformation (Chen et al., 2021). This analysis will provide quantitative substantiation of the collective processes enabling fake news penetration.\n\nThe consolidated findings from these mixed methods can support comprehensive theorizing of the socio-cultural dynamics at play in the normalization of fake news. A blended methodology is crucial for linking evidence from distinct analytical planes to derive a more contextualized and processual account. The qualitative findings add experiential depth around disrupted epistemic configurations while the quantitative data solidifies perceptions into generalizable models guiding intervention directions.\n\nExpected Contributions  \n\nWhile the phenomenon of fake news has attracted substantial scholarly attention, comprehensive sociological accounts remain scarce. This study will help address this gap and further illuminate the intersectional dynamics that triggered and propelled the proliferation of misinformation on digital networks. The rise of fake news is neither technologically determined nor politically orchestrated alone, although both are certainly contributing drivers. Rather it indexes a deeper epistemic crisis in institutional frameworks around credibility, verification, and reliability engendered through the complex interplay of various social currents (McMillan, 2019). The proposed research will surface these currents and pressure points through grounded empirical enquiry.\n\nFirst, the findings can foreground the role of broader socio-cultural shifts that generated conditions conducive for fake news to thrive. For instance, interviews may trace diminishing trust in legacy media as a pivotal precursor that devalued traditional gatekeeping; while surveys may reveal a generational divide in orientations to online news reflecting cohort socialization differences. Combining macro and micro evidence can demonstrate how institutional vulnerabilities intersect with emerging usage norms and attitudes.\n \nSecond, the research will provide definitive evidence for the network mechanisms enabling misinformation spread as a social phenomenon. Fake news achieves impact through its penetration in information flows and digital cultures, as demonstrated through diffusion patterns. Mapping this ground-level percolation offers cues toward interventions like building herd immunity by inoculating influencer nodes.\n\nFinally, agentic capacities can also be highlighted through examining user tactics for negotiating contested online spaces swirling with misinformation. Beyond passive reception, audiences also interpretively maneuver fake news, as surveys might indicate through segments displaying savvier orientations. There are also emerging grassroots practices for collective sensemaking around news veracity that hint at collaborative counter-power (Mejias & Vokuev, 2017). \n\nThus, the consolidated understanding developed through mixed datasets will propel explanatory principles as well as practical directions to meaningfully combat information disorders. Building predictive models can potentially forecast fake news diffusion trajectories, while unpacking socio-cultural logics provides impetus for literacy initiatives. The proposed research agenda meshes analytical focus on structures with ethnographic sensitivities around human experiences.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe proliferation of misinformation signals severe disjunctures in the modern social imagination and its regimenting epistemic architecture built around journalism. The aura of ambiguity and confusion that fake news introduces into public discourse speaks to a time of heightened precarity, polarization, and loss of stable reference points (Bauman & Donskis, 2013). At such fraught junctures, sociology is called upon to make sense of escalating complexity and provide ballast through its understanding of underlying currents that tie together wider collectivities (Mills, 2000).\n\nWhile acknowledging the very real disruptions wrought by fake news, this paper argues that instead of piecemeal techno-bureaucratic fixes, the need of the hour is comprehensive diagnosis of emerging networked pathologies (Castells, 2015). Sociological framing that probes institutional breakpoints and reconstructs configurations of actors can expand the menu of meaningful responses. For instance, elucidating vulnerabilities opened up by platformization of news alerts policymakers to strengthen public service media alternatives grounded in non-commercial, democratic ethos.\n\nSimilarly, mapping inflammatory information flows reveals possibilities for tempering virality through thoughtful interface interventions. And highlighting residual user agency underscores potentials for grassroots mobilization around shared epistemic values, instead of just top-down disciplinary measures. Thus, adopting sociological lenses prods consideration of fundamental questions of community, identity, and meaning imperiled by industrialized disinformation. \n\nThe seeds for repairing today\u2019s damaged information environments and reinventing credible knowledge institutions are scattered across everyday practices of consumed users, committed journalists and conscientious technologists. A sociology of fake news can nourish those seeds by nurturing understanding of intersecting interests, imagined solidarities, and emergent social contracts underpinning ethically ordered public spheres. As Mills (1959) noted, crafting such diagnostics of troubled times is a key calling of the sociological imagination.\n\nReferences\n\nAgger, B. (2006). Critical social theories: An introduction.

As C.W. Mills (1959) emphasizes, sociological imagination enables linking individual troubles to broader public issues by locating personal experiences in their sociohistorical contexts. Adopting this orientation, the current paper aims to elucidate the sociology of fake news and unpack the social forces and configurations that have facilitated the rise of misinformation across digital cultures.  \n\nTo accomplish this, the paper will begin by outlining the background and context that gave rise to the contemporary fake news phenomenon as a disruptive force. It will then discuss three key theoretical lenses \u2013 critical theory, symbolic interactionism, and systems theory \u2013 that can inform sociological analysis of fake news. Next, the paper will review prior sociological research related to digital misinformation and highlight areas warranting further investigation. Subsequently, a proposed research program involving mixed methods will be detailed to address knowledge gaps and advance understanding of the social dynamics enabling fake news. The paper will conclude by considering expected contributions of such a research initiative along with implications for journalism, technology companies, educators, and policymakers.\n\nBackground\n\nFundamentally, the contemporary fake news phenomenon indicates a crisis in practices of knowledge production, gatekeeping, and verification that once preserved the reliability of information. News, as a validated form of knowledge, maintains its authority through disciplinary norms that uphold principles of truthfulness and objectivity (Hallin, 1994). This disciplinary matrix breaks down in case of fake news, which mimics the aesthetic form of news articles but is divorced from journalistic commitments to factual accuracy. Instead, fake news exaggerates, distorts, or wholly fabricates information to deliberately advance certain ideological agendas and influence beliefs (Mantzarlis, 2018). It propagates false narratives that feed into a fragmented and polarized climate of opinions, often intensifying existing social divisions. \n\nWhile elements of propaganda, misinformation, and yellow journalism have shadowed the news industry historically, the current infodemic of fake news is traced to the ascendance of social media, declining public trust in established media, increased political polarization, and the economic troubles facing journalism organizations (Carlson, 2017; Coleman, 2018). This combination of technological, political, economic and cultural factors constitutes the broader ecology that sociological analysis seeks to unpack in relation to fake news. In particular, the socially constructed nature of \u2018news\u2019 itself must be highlighted to appreciate what makes the phenomenon of fake news socially disruptive.\n\nThe news industry developed in tandem with notions of scientific objectivity, empirical truth, and informed debate that gained dominance in the 18th and 19th centuries (Schudson, 1978). Practices of news verification were institutionalized through reporting techniques, editorial oversight, and dependence on officials as trusted sources. Professional norms, ethical codes, and organizational routines became anchored to uphold credibility and public accountability (Kovach & Rosenstiel, 2014). Consequently, news acquired standing as a legitimate source of knowledge about public affairs, separate from propaganda or hearsay. It became embedded within democratic processes as their informational lifeline. \n\nHowever, fissures started appearing in this edifice by the turn of the 21st century owing to economic and technological disruptions. The advertiser model came under strain as audiences migrated online (Pickard, 2020). Digital platforms attracted advertising revenue, while also enabling amateur content providers to bypass journalism\u2019s gatekeepers and compete for attention. The erosion of business models hampered newsrooms, leaving fewer journalists to carry out resource intensive investigative work (Schiffrin, 2017). Simultaneously, public regard for media institutions declined steeply, attributable partially to politically motivated attacks on mainstream outlets (Lee, 2016). Distrust was also stoked by cases of malpractice that undercut assumptions of neutrality, like The New York Times\u2019 misleading reports on Iraq\u2019s supposed weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe resulting disaffection provided fertile grounds for fake news to take root. Outlets mimicking the look of news sites proliferated across the web, expertly manipulating social media algorithms to maximize exposure (Brashier & Schacter, 2020). Lacking constraints of professional accountability, dubious websites fabricated content on pressing public issues to propagate rumors, hoaxes, and viral conspiracy theories. This hollowed out the core of journalism by coopting its symbols of credibility for deceptive purposes (Tandoc et al., 2018). At the same time, selective exposure in online networks created echo chambers where partisan users only engaged with attitude-consistent information, limiting their grasp of contrary views (Quattrociocchi et al., 2016). The participatory architecture of social media further enabled rapid diffusion of fake news by making sharing frictionless (Vosoughi et al., 2018). Through these developments, misinformation attained widespread visibility, eroding boundaries between fact and fiction in digital environments. \n\nIn summary, while misinformation is not new, its current ubiquity points to an underlying institutional decline, as frameworks supporting reliable knowledge face pressure. To shed light on the dynamics of this decline and the collective processes enabling it, sociological constructs of news as a socially produced artifact anchored in professional norms offer important analytical purchase. Three key perspectives provide starting points for inquiry.\n\nTheoretical Groundings\n\nSociological insights draw attention to the institutional moorings of concepts like credibility, facticity, and journalistic authority (Schudson, 2001). Facts do not emerge in isolation but are produced through disciplinary frameworks that distinguish truth claims from falsehood. News, in this sense, is not a naturally occurring category but a stabilized construct rooted in professional norms and gatekeeping practices (Becker & Vlad, 2009). When these supports erode, the lines demarcating news from non-news contents become obscured. Three sociological lenses illuminate how such blurring unfolds and troubles previously entrenched classifications.\n\nCritical theory highlights connections between knowledge and power (Agger, 2006). Formation of public consciousness through media discourses is linked to dominant ideological frameworks that perpetuate existing social hierarchies. Spread of misinformation can be interpreted as symptomatic of efforts by influential actors to shape constituencies through divisive rhetoric and messaging (Fuchs, 2017). Online networks marked by virality and opacity readily lend themselves to such top-down opinion manipulation. Critical theory excavates how fake news leverages digital systems in attempts to mobilize particular politicized publics (Arriola, 2020).\n\nSymbolic interactionism focuses on microsocial processes of meaning-making (Blumer, 1986). Shared social realities emerge from everyday discourses, interpretive exchanges, and communications between situated individuals (Berger & Luckmann, 1966). Fake news gains traction by assimilating into contexts of meaning construction on digital platforms, message boards, and social conversations. Users make sense of misinformation through collective validation in online groups where credibility is relationally negotiated (Shao et al., 2017).\n\nSystems theory adopts a macro level view focusing on relationships between different social subsystems (Luhmann, 2012). Information disorders result from variances between media, technology, politics and other subsystems with limited capacities for self-correction. Fake news thrives in fragmented environments with weakened gatekeeping. Applying systems theory unravels how fake news percolates due to broad changes in institutional logics governing information flows (Barnhurst, 2019).  \n\nTogether these three lenses enable examining fake news at different levels of social reality ranging from macro structures to everyday interactions. Their integration develops a multi-layered sociological account.\n\nPrior Research   \n\nSeveral studies have yielded useful sociological insights regarding fake news. Focusing on media structures, researchers find that legacy outlets are struggling to adapt older practices to social media environments allowing misinformation to flourish (Carlson, 2017). Analyses also reveal how economic imperatives in digital capitalism incentivize attention-grabbing content over factual rigor, enabling fake news models to take off (Bell & Owen, 2017). Investigations into online echo chambers argue that social media creates polarized spaces where users consume ideologically aligned content, limiting exposure to alternative views (Quattrociocchi et al., 2016). Examinations of online political talk track the crystallization of counter-publics through fake news sharing practices (Reuters Institute, 2018). At a micro level, concepts like information laundering show how rumors gain credibility through diffusion across networks (Marwick & Lewis, 2017). Together these studies provide a rich sociological description of the complex dynamics involved in normalization of fake news.\n\nHowever, reviews note that existing research tends to adopt a technologically deterministic orientation (Guo & Vargo, 2018). Greater attention is needed to the agency of various stakeholders, interpretive capacities of audiences, and socially embedded character of digital platforms. Moreover, studies largely focus on discrete cases like elections, neglecting the broader infodemic. There is limited integration of insights across sociological subfields studying fake news through disparate lenses. Advancing sociological understanding calls for research that moves beyond transient political events toward long-range analysis of developments reconstituting contemporary information ecosystems. \n\nThe reviewed literature also suggests several underexplored aspects. First, how professional identities and epistemic cultures of journalism are challenged due to erosion of traditionally privileged truth telling roles requires examination. Ethnographies tracing these disruptions can capture experiential nuance (Eldridge II, 2018). Second, mapping cross-platform fake news diffusion and circulation necessitates combining trace data analysis with interviews to get at meanings embedded in sharing practices. Third, few investigations disaggregate fake news audiences to understand interpretation by differently situated publics. Surveys and focus groups can uncover diversity in decoding, sense-making and authentication (Tandoc et al., 2018). Finally, analyzing relationships between changes in media, politics and technology using a multilevel systems approach remains limited. Developing predictive models capturing their co-evolution can yield policy insights. \n\nProposed Methodology\n\nA mixed methods research program can expand sociological understanding of fake news by addressing identified gaps through interconnected studies. The research design knits together varied data sources to facilitate triangulation and multi-perspective analyses guided by the theoretical frameworks. The key components of the proposed initiative are highlighted below.\n\n1) Journalistic Field Study: An 18-month ethnography of three news organizations will use participant observation and interviews to unpack experiences of journalists as their profession undergoes transformations relating to credibility, verification practices, and epistemic cultures. Tracking tensions between traditional standards and social media imperatives will detail how constructions of journalistic knowledge are being renegotiated. \n\n2) Tracking Study: A panel study of 400 social media users over a year will gather bi-monthly survey responses on digital media diet, sharing patterns, attitudes to journalism, and demographics. Statistical analyses will model relationships between variables like platform use, social circles, and fake news perceptions to derive cultural insights. \n\n3) Trace Data Research: Using computational techniques like network mapping and geo-locational analysis, this study will visualize diffusion of fake news stories across platforms and stakeholders during three major news events. Combining trace data insights with ethnography of online publics will illuminate hidden contexts.\n\n4) Comparative Multi-Nation Study: To understand how journalistic traditions and political environments shape fake news receptions, surveys will compare US and European samples by administering standardized instruments assessing media trust, online behavior, and voting preferences. Revealing cross-national variances can highlight contextual factors.\n\n5) Impact Modeling Study: This computational simulation will integrate data from the above studies into agent-based models representing interactions between media, political, and technology subsystems. Running simulations will predict likely impacts of interventions like fact-checking, labeling techniques, platform reforms etc. \n\nTogether these interlinked investigations will enable probing fake news from micro to macro levels, gathering cross-contextual data pivotal for robust theorizing. They move beyond a focus only on users or content, adopting a sociological lens encompassing information ecosystems, journalistic fields, network publics and formal institutions implicated in the production, circulation and reception of fake news.\n\nExpected Contributions  \n\nWhile the phenomenon of fake news has attracted substantial scholarly attention, comprehensive sociological accounts remain scarce. This study will help address this gap and further illuminate the intersectional dynamics that have both triggered and propelled the proliferation of misinformation on digital networks. The rise of fake news is neither technologically determined nor politically orchestrated alone. Rather it indexes a climate of uncertainty and crisis in institutions of knowledge production engendered through the complex interplay of various social currents. The proposed research will unravel these currents and their pressure points. Building predictive models of fake news impact can also support interventions to improve media literacy and curb false narratives.  \n\nTheoretically, adopting integrative conceptual frameworks like assemblage theory or actor-network theory will help synthesize across sub-disciplinary perspectives and strengthen sociological explanations (Latour, 2005). As Davies (2019) notes, the essential task is to link micro level disorder in the information ecology to broader institutional and cultural changes remaking epistemic practices across public life. The proposed research will provide important empirical footholds toward this synthesis. Through multi-method analyses, it will demonstrate how news construction and circulation involve heterogeneous networks linking actors, artifacts and meanings across contexts.\n\nPractically, mapping vulnerabilities in existing configurations can inform reforms in journalism education, technology platforms, policy regimes and civic literacy initiatives. For instance, understanding audience interpretations and system modeled impacts can guide social media companies toward algorithmic transparency and content moderation policies that curb fake news sharing incentives. Enhancing critical thinking abilities, media literacy and verification skills among news consumers is another pivotal priority (Kavanagh & Rich, 2018). Generated insights can shape educational curricula and inform public advocacy campaigns to this end. They can also assist advocacy directed toward ameliorating economic conditions facing journalism, strengthening professional standards, and updating media regulations for digital environments.\n\nAt a broader level, the research will highlight the widening rift between institutions of truth production and today\u2019s digitally mediated realities. As networked digital cultures foster relativist orientations, postmodern sensibilities and skepticism of authority claims, shoring up empirical moorings for democratic deliberation becomes imperative (McMillan, 2019). This underscores the need for a revitalized social contract between journalism and publics it addresses but increasingly fails to meaningfully inform or engage. Problematizing fake news provides openings to foment discussion on pathways for restoring this fractured relationship in the service of a properly functioning public sphere.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe virality of misinformation gestures toward widening fissures in the modern social imaginary and its anchoring epistemic frameworks. As political passions escalate and technological change accelerates, preserving spaces for credible public discourse becomes imperative. Developing sociological understandings of fake news provides a window into the reconstitution of knowledge cultures underway and can inform regulatory and educational responses. Moving forward, strengthening verification capacities and foregrounding ethics of civic deliberation are crucial to heal increasingly fractured information environments. Tracking the sociology of fake news thus sheds light on deeper challenges of community, identity and meaning construction facing contemporary public life.\n\nReferences\n\nAgger, B. (2006).

Let me provide you with information about each:\n\nLucca:\n\n1. City-State Status: Lucca was an independent republic and city-state from 1160 to 1805, making it one of the longest-lasting city-states in Italy.\n\n2. Location: Situated in Tuscany, Lucca was strategically positioned between Florence and Pisa.\n\n3. Economy: The city was known for its silk and textile production, which brought it considerable wealth.\n\n4. Politics: Lucca maintained its independence through skilled diplomacy, often playing larger powers against each other.\n\n5. Architecture: The city is famous for its well-preserved Renaissance-era city walls, which still stand today.\n\n6. Notable Period: In the 14th century, Lucca was briefly ruled by the powerful Castracani family, with Castruccio Castracani being a notable figure.\n\n7. Cultural Significance: Lucca was an important stop on the Via Francigena, a major pilgrimage route.\n\nCastiglione di Garfagnana:\n\n1. Location: Castiglione is located in the Garfagnana region, a historical and geographical region in northern Tuscany.\n\n2. Strategic Importance: It was a crucial fortress town, controlling access to the Garfagnana valley.\n\n3. Ruled by Este Family: For much of the city-state era, Castiglione was under the control of the Este family, who ruled from Ferrara and later Modena.\n\n4. Frontier Town: It often served as a frontier between the spheres of influence of Lucca, Florence, and Modena.\n\n5. Fortifications: The town is known for its impressive medieval fortifications, including walls and a fortress, which reflect its strategic importance.\n\n6. Economy: Unlike the more commercially oriented Lucca, Castiglione's economy was more based on agriculture and its military significance.\n\n7. Conflicts: The town was often involved in conflicts between larger powers, particularly Lucca and Florence, who sought control over the Garfagnana region.\n\nRelationship and Context:\n\n1. Regional Dynamics: While Lucca was a major independent city-state, Castiglione di Garfagnana was often a point of contention between larger powers.\n\n2. Economic Contrast: Lucca's wealth from trade and industry contrasted with Castiglione's more militaristic and agricultural role.\n\n3. Political Complexity: The relationship between these two places exemplifies the complex political landscape of medieval and Renaissance Italy, with its patchwork of city-states, feudal territories, and spheres of influence.\n\n4. Territorial Disputes: Control over places like Castiglione was often crucial for larger city-states like Lucca in maintaining their independence and territorial integrity.\n\nThis era of Italian city-states was characterized by intense political fragmentation, economic competition, and cultural flourishing, with places like Lucca and Castiglione di Garfagnana playing their unique roles in this complex tapestry.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-26T18:11:49.368639Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-26T18:11:49.368639Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "dec28c50-4e05-4ff7-a699-8c3df369fc9b", "text": "Who ruled Lucca?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-26T18:14:46.073135Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-26T18:14:46.073135Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "3edebdd5-4cf5-44b2-9c19-b75998948e8e", "text": " Lucca's governance during its time as a city-state was complex and changed over the centuries. Here's an overview of its rulers and forms of government:\n\n1. Early Period (12th-13th centuries):\n   - Initially ruled by Marquises, then became a commune with consuls.\n   - In 1160, it gained independence as a republic.\n\n2. Oligarchic Republic (13th-14th centuries):\n   - Governed by wealthy merchant families.\n   - Key institutions included the General Council and the Council of Elders.\n\n3. Castracani Era (1316-1328):\n   - Castruccio Castracani ruled as Lord of Lucca.\n   - He expanded Lucca's territory significantly.\n\n4. Period of Foreign Control (14th century):\n   - Brief periods of rule by Pisa, Florence, and others.\n   - John of Bohemia briefly held control.\n\n5. Return to Republican Rule (1370):\n   - Lucca regained independence.\n   - Governed by a Gonfaloniere (chief magistrate) and a Council of Elders.\n\n6. Guinigi Signoria (1400-1430):\n   - Paolo Guinigi ruled as Lord of Lucca.\n\n7. Oligarchic Republic (1430-1799):\n   - Return to republican government.\n   - Ruled by a small group of noble families.\n   - Key governing body was the Council of Thirty-Six.\n\n8. Late Period:\n   - Brief French occupation during Napoleonic wars.\n   - In 1805, became a principality under Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi, Napoleon's sister.\n\nKey Points:\n- Lucca maintained independence longer than many Italian city-states.\n- It alternated between republican forms of government and periods of signoria (lordship).\n- The city was often ruled by its wealthy merchant class rather than a single family dynasty.\n- Lucca's government was generally more stable and less prone to faction fighting than some other Italian city-states.\n\nLucca's ability to maintain independence and relative stability for so long was due to a combination of economic prosperity, strategic diplomacy, and effective governance structures that evolved over time.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-26T18:14:46.073135Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-26T18:14:46.073135Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "734bde47-1bd8-46c2-ae18-646effbb1e95", "text": " To identify which version of a Lilygo T-Watch-2020 you have, you'll need to look at a few key features.

He's a fascinating historical figure known for his eccentricities, artistic patronage, and the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death. Here are some key points about him:\n\n1. Early Life: Born in 1845, Ludwig became king at the young age of 18 following his father's death.\n\n2. Artistic Patron: He was a great patron of the arts, most famously supporting the composer Richard Wagner.\n\n3. Castle Builder: Ludwig is renowned for commissioning the construction of several elaborate castles, including:\n   - Neuschwanstein Castle (which later inspired Disney's Sleeping Beauty Castle)\n   - Linderhof Palace\n   - Herrenchiemsee Palace (modeled after Versailles)\n\n4. Eccentricities: He was known for his night-time sleigh rides, elaborate dinners for imaginary guests, and his desire to live in a fantasy world of medieval legends.\n\n5. Political Withdrawal: As he aged, Ludwig became increasingly reclusive and withdrew from his governmental duties, focusing instead on his artistic and architectural projects.\n\n6. Mental State: There was much speculation about his mental health, with some contemporaries describing him as \"mad.\" Modern historians debate the accuracy of this assessment.\n\n7. Deposition and Death: In 1886, he was declared unfit to rule and was deposed. Shortly after, he died under mysterious circumstances in Lake Starnberg, along with the psychiatrist who had declared him insane.\n\n8. Legacy: Today, Ludwig II is remembered more fondly in Bavaria. His castles are major tourist attractions, and he's seen as a romantic figure who brought significant cultural and economic benefits to the region.\n\nLudwig II's life continues to fascinate historians and the public, blending elements of fairy tale grandeur with the complexities of 19th-century politics and changing societal norms.

He's one of the most infamous figures in Roman history, known for his erratic behavior and cruel reign. Here's an overview:\n\n1. Early Life: Born in 12 AD, he was the son of the popular Roman general Germanicus. His childhood nickname \"Caligula\" (meaning \"little boot\") came from the miniature military boots he wore as a child.\n\n2. Rise to Power: He became emperor at age 24 following the death of his great-uncle Tiberius.\n\n3. Initial Popularity: His reign started positively, with acts of generosity and public works projects.\n\n4. Descent into Tyranny: After about six months, Caligula's rule became increasingly erratic and tyrannical. Some historians speculate this change might have been triggered by an illness.\n\n5. Infamous Acts: Many outrageous stories are associated with Caligula, though their accuracy is debated:\n   - Allegedly declared himself a living god\n   - Appointed his horse, Incitatus, as a consul (or planned to)\n   - Engaged in incestuous relationships with his sisters\n   - Ordered troops to attack the sea and collect seashells as \"spoils of war\"\n\n6. Financial Excesses: He quickly depleted the treasury with extravagant spending on games, races, and personal luxuries.\n\n7. Cruelty and Executions: He was known for arbitrary executions, including members of his own family and the Roman elite.\n\n8. Assassination: His reign ended after only four years when he was assassinated by members of the Praetorian Guard in 41 AD.\n\n9. Legacy: Caligula's name has become synonymous with tyranny, excess, and insanity in popular culture.\n\nIt's worth noting that much of what we know about Caligula comes from sources written after his death, some of which may have been biased or exaggerated. Nonetheless, his short reign is generally considered a period of misrule in Roman history.\n\nThe story of Caligula raises interesting questions about power, mental stability, and how history remembers controversial figures.

Let me explain how it typically handles processor assignment:\n\n1. Dual-Core Architecture:\n   The ESP32 in the T-Watch-2020 V1 has two cores: Core 0 and Core 1.\n\n2. Default Core Usage:\n   - Core 0: By default, the Arduino environment and most user tasks run on Core 0.\n   - Core 1: The TTGO_TWatch_Library often uses Core 1 for background tasks and certain hardware interactions.\n\n3. Task Distribution:\n   - The library doesn't explicitly assign all tasks to specific cores. Many functions run on whatever core calls them.\n   - Some background tasks, particularly those related to power management or continuous sensor reading, may be assigned to Core 1.\n\n4. Power Management:\n   The AXP20X power management tasks often run on Core 1 to ensure consistent monitoring without interrupting the main application.\n\n5. Display Updates:\n   Display-related tasks usually run on the core that calls them, which is typically Core 0 if initiated from the main Arduino loop.\n\n6. Sensor Monitoring:\n   Continuous sensor monitoring (like the accelerometer) may be set up to run on Core 1.\n\n7. User Control:\n   The library generally doesn't prevent you from assigning tasks to specific cores. You can use ESP32's built-in functions like xTaskCreatePinnedToCore() to assign tasks to a particular core if needed.\n\n8. Flexibility:\n   The library is designed to be flexible, allowing developers to optimize core usage based on their specific application needs.\n\n9. Configuration:\n   Some aspects of task distribution can be adjusted in the library's configuration files, though this requires a deeper understanding of the library's internals.\n\nIt's worth noting that the exact core assignment can vary depending on the version of the library and the specific feature set being used. The library's design aims to balance performance and power efficiency, which is crucial for a wearable device like the T-Watch.\n\nIf you're developing a performance-critical application, you might want to use ESP32's native FreeRTOS functions to have more explicit control over task assignment to cores.

Let me explain what this valve is likely designed to do:\n\n1. Function: Water Diverter Valve\n   This valve is most likely a water diverter or selector valve. Its primary purpose is to control and direct the flow of water between two different paths in the refrigerator.\n\n2. Operation:\n   - The single tube side is probably the inlet, where water enters the valve.\n   - The two tubes on the other side are likely two different outlets, each leading to a different component or function in the refrigerator.\n\n3. Common Applications:\n   a) Ice Maker and Water Dispenser Selection:\n      - One outlet might lead to the ice maker\n      - The other outlet could lead to the water dispenser\n\n   b) Dual Ice Maker Systems:\n      - In refrigerators with two ice makers (e.g., one in the freezer, one in the door), this valve could direct water to either ice maker.\n\n   c) Water Filter Bypass:\n      - One path might lead through a water filter\n      - The other path could bypass the filter (used when changing filters or if the filter is clogged)\n\n4. Control Mechanism:\n   - The valve is likely electronically controlled by the refrigerator's main control board.\n   - It switches between the two outlet paths based on which function is being used (e.g., making ice vs. dispensing water).\n\n5. Operation Mode:\n   - When not energized, it may default to one path.\n   - When energized, it switches to the other path.\n\n6. Importance:\n   - This valve ensures that water is directed to the correct component at the right time.\n   - It prevents issues like water flowing to the ice maker when you're trying to use the water dispenser, or vice versa.\n\nUnderstanding this valve's function is crucial for diagnosing issues related to water flow in your refrigerator. If you're experiencing problems with either the ice maker or water dispenser (but not both), this valve could be the culprit. \n\nRemember, while this is the most likely function based on the description, without seeing the specific model or its placement in the refrigerator, there could be variations in its exact purpose.

This is an important part of the refrigeration system. Let me explain its characteristics and function:\n\n1. Description:\n   - Small but long copper cylinder\n   - Connected to one output of the solenoid valve\n   - Leads to two larger diameter tubes\n\n2. Function: Filter Drier\n   This component serves two crucial purposes in the refrigeration system:\n   a) Filtration: It removes contaminants from the refrigerant.\n   b) Moisture Removal: It absorbs moisture from the refrigerant system.\n\n3. Construction:\n   - Copper shell: Provides durability and good heat transfer.\n   - Internal desiccant: Usually contains materials like activated alumina or molecular sieve.\n   - Filter screen: Traps solid particles.\n\n4. Importance:\n   - Protects the compressor from damage by removing harmful contaminants.\n   - Prevents moisture-related issues like ice formation in the expansion device.\n   - Helps maintain the efficiency and longevity of the refrigeration system.\n\n5. Location in the System:\n   - Typically installed in the liquid line, before the expansion device.\n   - Its position after the solenoid valve is common in some refrigerator designs.\n\n6. Connection to Larger Tubes:\n   - The larger diameter tubes likely represent the transition from the liquid line to other parts of the refrigeration cycle, possibly leading to the evaporator or expansion device.\n\n7. Relation to the Solenoid Valve:\n   - The solenoid valve might control the flow of refrigerant through this filter drier, possibly as part of a defrost cycle or system optimization process.\n\n8. Replacement:\n   - Filter driers are often replaced when the refrigeration system is opened for repairs, as they can become saturated over time.\n\nThis configuration suggests that your refrigerator has a more complex refrigeration system, possibly with multiple cooling zones or advanced features. The solenoid valve might be controlling when refrigerant flows through this filter drier, which could be part of a system to optimize cooling efficiency or manage defrost cycles.\n\nIf you're troubleshooting issues with your refrigerator's cooling performance, this filter drier could be a component to consider, especially if there are signs of moisture or contamination in the system.

Professional technicians follow specific procedures and use specialized tools to handle the pressurized refrigerant safely. Here's how they typically approach this:\n\n1. Recovery Equipment:\n   - Technicians use a refrigerant recovery machine to safely remove and store the refrigerant from the system before opening it.\n   - This reduces the pressure in the system to safe levels.\n\n2. Pressure Gauges:\n   - Manifold gauge sets are used to monitor the pressure in different parts of the system.\n   - These help technicians understand the state of the system and ensure safe pressure levels.\n\n3. Safety Valves:\n   - Many refrigeration systems have built-in safety valves that release pressure if it becomes dangerously high.\n\n4. Proper Training:\n   - Technicians undergo specific training on how to handle pressurized systems safely.\n   - This includes understanding the properties of different refrigerants and their associated pressures.\n\n5. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):\n   - Safety glasses, gloves, and sometimes face shields are used to protect against potential refrigerant leaks.\n\n6. Controlled Release:\n   - If needed, technicians may slowly release pressure using service valves, allowing for a controlled depressurization.\n\n7. Vacuum Pumps:\n   - After repairs, a vacuum pump is used to remove air and moisture from the system before recharging.\n\n8. Leak Detection:\n   - Electronic leak detectors or soap solutions are used to check for leaks before pressurizing the system.\n\n9. Proper Tools:\n   - Specialized tools like flaring tools, tube cutters, and brazing equipment are used to ensure proper sealing when working on pressurized components.\n\n10. Legal Considerations:\n    - In many jurisdictions, handling refrigerants requires certification (e.g., EPA certification in the US).\n    - This ensures that only qualified individuals work on these systems.\n\n11. System Knowledge:\n    - Understanding the specific refrigeration cycle and components helps in anticipating pressure issues.\n\n12. Gradual Repressurization:\n    - After repairs, systems are gradually recharged and pressurized to avoid sudden stress on components.\n\n13. Documentation:\n    - Technicians often document pressures and temperatures at various points in the system for future reference.\n\nIt's important to note that working on pressurized refrigeration systems can be dangerous if not done properly. Refrigerants can cause frostbite if they contact skin, and some can displace oxygen in enclosed spaces. Additionally, improper handling can lead to environmental damage, as many refrigerants are potent greenhouse gases.\n\nFor these reasons, it's generally recommended that only certified professionals work on refrigeration systems.

Making it more relatable and human-centric\n2. Visually representing the idea of a person sharing content from their own space\n3. Adding a touch of personality to the design\n\nThe stick figure's simple design keeps the overall logo clean and easily recognizable even at smaller sizes.\n\nIs this what you had in mind?

Crimson House: A bold crimson (#DC143C) house with the pale blue Wi-Fi signals, creating a vibrant and energetic look.\n\n2. Forest Green House: A natural forest green (#228B22) house with pale blue Wi-Fi signals, evoking a sense of growth and stability.\n\n3. Dark Purple House: A deep indigo (#4B0082) house with pale blue Wi-Fi signals, offering a regal and mysterious appearance.\n\n4. Burnt Orange House: A warm burnt orange (#CC5500) house with pale blue Wi-Fi signals, providing a friendly and inviting feel.\n\n5. Charcoal Gray House: A sophisticated charcoal gray (#36454F) house with pale blue Wi-Fi signals, presenting a professional and modern look.\n\nThese new variations maintain the consistency of the pale blue Wi-Fi symbol while exploring different house colors. This approach creates a unified element across the designs while still offering variety in the overall look.\n\nNow you have a total of 20 different color schemes to choose from, with these last five maintaining the original Wi-Fi signal color. This gives you options ranging from bold and energetic to calm and professional, all while keeping a consistent element.\n\nDo any of these new variations particularly appeal to you?

It's visually striking while still maintaining clarity in its symbolism.\n\nThe black stick figure might represent the individual user more distinctly, potentially emphasizing the personal nature of self-hosted content.\n\nDo you like this combination?

Original Design: Crimson house, pale blue Wi-Fi, black doorway/figure.\n\n2. Navy House: Same as original, but with a navy blue (#000080) house instead of crimson. This offers a more professional, corporate feel while maintaining the strong contrast.\n\n3. White Figure: Crimson house and pale blue Wi-Fi, but with a white figure instead of black. This creates a striking contrast against the black doorway, emphasizing the human element.\n\n4. Gold Wi-Fi: Crimson house and black doorway/figure, but with gold (#FFD700) Wi-Fi signals instead of pale blue. This gives a more luxurious, premium feel to the \"broadcasting\" aspect.\n\n5. Outlined House: Instead of a solid crimson house, this version uses a crimson outline. The interior of the house is transparent, creating a more open, airy feel while maintaining the recognizable shape.\n\nEach variation maintains the core concept but offers a different mood or emphasis:\n\n- The navy house feels more corporate and stable.\n- The white figure draws more attention to the human element.\n- The gold Wi-Fi signals add a touch of prestige to the broadcasting concept.\n- The outlined house creates a sense of openness and transparency.\n\nThese variations allow you to consider different visual metaphors and feelings associated with the \"homepage first\" concept. \n\nWhich of these variations do you find most appealing or fitting for your campaign?

Brain-like Patterns: On the forehead of the dog, there are wavy lines reminiscent of brain folds, suggesting intelligence.\n\n3. Sensory Symbols: Near the nose and ears, there are wave-like patterns representing smell and hearing, emphasizing a dog's keen senses as part of their intelligence.\n\n4. Eyes: The eyes are prominent and alert, suggesting awareness and cognition.\n\n5. Thought Bubble: A small thought bubble near the top of the head contains a paw print, symbolizing that the dog's thoughts and intelligence are distinctly canine.\n\n6. Color Scheme: The warm brown colors are typical of many dog breeds, making the image immediately recognizable as a dog.\n\nThis logo attempts to convey:\n\n- Intelligence: Through the brain-like patterns and alert eyes.\n- Unique Canine Perspective: Via the emphasis on sensory input (smell and hearing waves) and the paw print in the thought bubble.\n- Dog-ness: The overall shape and colors are unmistakably dog-like.\n\nThe design aims to show that while dogs are intelligent, their intelligence is focused on different areas than human intelligence - more sensory-based and instinctual, yet still complex and valuable.\n\nWould you like me to modify any aspects of this logo or explore a different approach to representing canine intelligence?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-27T00:50:34.676333Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T00:50:34.676333Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "dbc53410-8296-4706-892a-81a1dc3a881a", "text": "Make it look more like a black, white and brown mutt, but with expansive intelligence, that humans don't understand", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-27T00:52:11.912140Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T00:52:11.912140Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "cbffcad0-655f-41c7-a73e-eb255f903665", "text": " Certainly!

Here's a breakdown of the elements and their symbolism:\n\n1. Dog's Appearance:\n   - The main shape is a stylized dog's head with a brown base.\n   - Black patches on the ears and top of the head represent a mixed-breed appearance.\n   - A white patch on the snout and chest area completes the mutt look.\n\n2. Eyes:\n   - Large, prominent eyes with deep purple irises suggest depth and mystery.\n   - The intense gaze implies a level of awareness beyond human understanding.\n\n3. Mystical Energy Patterns:\n   - Cyan and magenta wave-like patterns surrounding the dog represent complex thought processes and energy fields not visible to humans.\n   - These patterns suggest a form of intelligence or perception that transcends ordinary understanding.\n\n4. Constellation Pattern:\n   - A subtle star-like pattern on the forehead implies cosmic connections or a higher level of consciousness.\n   - This could represent the dog's ability to perceive or understand things on a universal scale.\n\n5. Abstract Thought Symbols:\n   - Golden wave-like patterns near the bottom represent abstract thought processes.\n   - Their unconventional shape suggests thinking patterns that differ from human logic.\n\nThis logo attempts to convey:\n\n- Mixed-Breed Appearance: Through the combination of brown, black, and white coloring.\n- Expansive Intelligence: Via the mystical energy patterns and constellation-like connections.\n- Otherworldly Perception: Through the unique eye color and surrounding energy fields.\n- Non-Human Thought Processes: Represented by the abstract golden thought waves.\n\nThe overall design aims to portray a dog that possesses a form of intelligence that is vast and incomprehensible to humans, rooted in sensory perceptions and instincts that we can't fully grasp. The mixture of earthly (dog appearance) and cosmic (energy patterns, constellations) elements suggests a bridge between the mundane and the extraordinary.\n\nDoes this representation align with your vision of a mutt with expansive, human-incomprehensible intelligence?

Here's a breakdown of the elements:\n\n1. Dog's Profile:\n   - The main shape is a stylized dog's head in profile, emphasizing the long nose.\n   - The fur is mostly black, as requested.\n\n2. Fur Patches:\n   - A brown patch on the lower part of the face adds some color variation.\n   - A small white patch on the chest breaks up the black and adds to the mutt appearance.\n\n3. Eye:\n   - A single visible eye with a deep purple iris suggests depth and mystery.\n   - The intense gaze implies a level of awareness beyond human understanding.\n\n4. Ear:\n   - A pointed ear adds to the alert, intelligent appearance.\n\n5. Mystical Energy Patterns:\n   - Cyan and magenta wave-like patterns surrounding the dog represent complex thought processes and energy fields not visible to humans.\n\n6. Constellation Pattern:\n   - A subtle star-like pattern above the eye implies cosmic connections or a higher level of consciousness.\n\n7. Abstract Thought Symbols:\n   - Golden wave-like patterns near the nose represent abstract thought processes, suggesting thinking patterns that differ from human logic.\n\nThis logo conveys:\n\n- Distinct Mutt Appearance: Through the long nose and mix of black, brown, and white fur.\n- Expansive Intelligence: Via the mystical energy patterns and constellation-like connections.\n- Otherworldly Perception: Through the unique eye color and surrounding energy fields.\n- Non-Human Thought Processes: Represented by the abstract golden thought waves.\n\nThe profile view emphasizes the dog's long nose, which could imply heightened sensory abilities (especially smell), often associated with a dog's unique form of intelligence. The predominantly black fur gives a sense of mystery and depth, while the energy patterns and cosmic elements suggest an intelligence that transcends human understanding.\n\nDoes this profile view better capture your vision of a mutt with expansive, human-incomprehensible intelligence?

In neuroscience, there are two main types of homunculi:\n\n1. Sensory Homunculus (also called Penfield's Homunculus):\n   This represents the sensory map of the human body in the brain's somatosensory cortex. It shows how much of the brain is devoted to processing sensory input from different body parts.\n\n2. Motor Homunculus:\n   This represents the motor map of the human body in the brain's motor cortex. It illustrates how much of the brain is devoted to controlling movement in different body parts.\n\nThese homunculi are often depicted as distorted human figures, with body parts sized proportionally to the amount of brain space dedicated to them. For example, the hands and face are typically much larger than other body parts because they have more sensory receptors and require more precise control.\n\nThe concept was developed and popularized by neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield in the 1930s and 1940s through his work on epilepsy patients. He mapped the sensory and motor cortices of the brain by electrically stimulating different areas and observing the patients' responses.\n\nThese visual representations are valuable tools in neuroscience and medicine for understanding how the brain processes sensory information and controls movement across different parts of the body.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-27T01:09:54.846280Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T01:09:54.846280Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "9a82a76c-7592-4cd5-9ae4-7b8c82ebb718", "text": "Please make an svg drawing of a Sensory Homunculus of a dog.", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-27T01:11:49.040071Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T01:11:49.040071Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "a89c632a-fc53-4a33-8c60-a72a95e89e6b", "text": " Creating a sensory homunculus for a dog is an intriguing and complex task, as it requires adapting our understanding of canine neurology to a visual representation similar to the human sensory homunculus.

This is the most exaggerated feature, as olfaction is a dog's primary sensory input.\n\n2. Ears: Significantly larger than normal, indicating the importance of hearing in a dog's sensory world.\n\n3. Paws: Enlarged, representing the sensitivity of a dog's paws for touch and vibration sensing.\n\n4. Whiskers: Prominently featured, as they're important tactile sensors for dogs.\n\n5. Eyes: Slightly enlarged, but not as much as the nose or ears, reflecting their relatively lesser importance compared to smell and hearing.\n\n6. Tongue: Visible and slightly enlarged, representing the importance of taste and the mouth area for sensory input.\n\n7. Tail: Small representation, as it's less significant for sensory input compared to other body parts.\n\nThis representation aims to visually depict the relative importance of different sensory inputs for a dog. The exaggerated nose dominates the figure, reflecting the primacy of olfaction in canine sensory processing. The large ears and paws also stand out, indicating their significant roles in how dogs perceive their environment.\n\nIt's important to note that this is an artistic interpretation based on general knowledge of canine sensory priorities. Unlike human homunculi, which are based on detailed cortical mapping, we don't have equally precise data for dogs.

Here's a breakdown of the animations:\n\n1. Head Movement: The entire head (including the nose, eyes, and whiskers) moves in a circular motion, simulating the dog moving its head to catch different scents.\n\n2. Nose Animation: The nose has an additional, more rapid movement to emphasize the sniffing action.\n\n3. Ear Wiggle: The ears have a subtle wiggling animation, alternating between left and right, to add to the overall sense of movement and alertness.\n\nThe animations are implemented using CSS keyframes within the SVG:\n\n- The `sniff` animation moves the head in a circular pattern.\n- The `earWiggle` animation gives a subtle movement to the ears.\n- These animations are applied to different parts of the SVG using IDs and the `animation` property.\n\nThe movements are intentionally exaggerated to emphasize the importance of olfaction in a dog's sensory world. The large, prominent nose remains the focal point of the animation, reinforcing its significance in the dog's sensory homunculus.\n\nThis animated SVG should convey the idea of a dog actively using its primary sense (smell) to investigate its environment, with the exaggerated movements highlighting the dominance of olfactory processing in canine sensory perception.\n\nWould you like any adjustments to the animation?

Here's a breakdown of the animation:\n\n1. Fred's Body: The main body shape is recreated using SVG paths to match the simplistic style of the original drawing.\n\n2. Macarena Dance: \n   - The entire body moves in a bouncing pattern, simulating the basic Macarena rhythm.\n   - The arms move independently, rotating to mimic the arm movements of the Macarena dance.\n\n3. Animation Details:\n   - The `macarena` keyframe animation moves Fred's entire body in a square pattern.\n   - The `armMove` keyframe animation rotates the arms up and down.\n   - The right arm's animation is slightly delayed compared to the left arm to create a more dynamic effect.\n\n4. Style: \n   - The drawing style is kept simple with black outlines and no fill, matching the original image.\n   - The lines are slightly thicker to make the character more visible when animated.\n\nThis animated SVG captures the playful spirit of the original drawing while bringing Fred to life with the Macarena dance. The simplicity of the character is maintained, but now he's grooving to the beat!\n\nWould you like any adjustments to Fred or his dance moves?

Here's how you can achieve dynamic imports in Node.js:\n\n1. Use dynamic import():\n   ES modules support a dynamic `import()` function that returns a Promise. This allows you to import modules at runtime.\n\nHere's how you might structure this:\n\nA.js:\n```javascript\nasync function loadModule(modulePath) {\n  try {\n    const module = await import(modulePath);\n    return module;\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error loading module:', error);\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nasync function main() {\n  const modulePath = './B.js';  // This could be determined at runtime\n  const moduleB = await loadModule(modulePath);\n  \n  if (moduleB) {\n    // Use the module here\n    moduleB.someFunction();\n  }\n}\n\nmain();\n```\n\nB.js:\n```javascript\nexport function someFunction() {\n  console.log('Function from B.js');\n}\n```\n\n2. Important considerations:\n\n   a. File extension: When using `import()` with ES modules, you typically need to include the file extension (`.js`).\n\n   b. Relative paths: The path in `import()` is relative to the current module, not the working directory.\n\n   c. Security: Be cautious when using dynamic imports with user-supplied paths to avoid potential security risks.\n\n   d. Module caching: Node.js caches modules, so subsequent imports of the same module will return the cached version.\n\n3. Using with unknown module names:\n\nIf you don't know the exact exports of the module, you can use the `default` export or enumerate over the module's exports:\n\n```javascript\nasync function main() {\n  const modulePath = './B.js';\n  const moduleB = await import(modulePath);\n  \n  // If using default export\n  if (moduleB.default) {\n    moduleB.default();\n  }\n  \n  // Or, enumerate over all exports\n  for (const [name, exported] of Object.entries(moduleB)) {\n    if (typeof exported === 'function') {\n      exported();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Loading from non-relative paths:\n\nIf you need to load from an absolute path or a path that's not relative to the current module, you can use the `url` module:\n\n```javascript\nimport { pathToFileURL } from 'url';\n\nasync function loadModule(absolutePath) {\n  const moduleUrl = pathToFileURL(absolutePath).href;\n  return import(moduleUrl);\n}\n```\n\nRemember to run Node.js with the `--experimental-modules` flag if you're using an older version of Node.js, though recent versions support ES modules by default.\n\nThis approach allows you to dynamically load modules in Node.js with ES modules, even when the module name or location is not known until runtime.

I apologize for not addressing that aspect in my previous response. Let's explore a concept more akin to Java's classpath in Node.js.\n\nIn Node.js, there isn't a direct equivalent to Java's classpath, but we can achieve similar functionality using the module resolution algorithm and environment variables. Here's a conceptual approach:\n\n1. Use NODE_PATH environment variable:\n\nNode.js uses the NODE_PATH environment variable to specify additional directories to search for modules. This is conceptually similar to Java's classpath.\n\n```bash\nexport NODE_PATH=/over/here\n```\n\n2. Create a custom module loader:\n\nWe can create a function that mimics the behavior of searching multiple paths, similar to how Java searches the classpath.\n\nHere's an example implementation:\n\n```javascript\n// A.js\nimport { createRequire } from 'module';\nimport { dirname } from 'path';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'url';\n\nconst __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);\nconst __dirname = dirname(__filename);\n\nfunction loadModule(moduleName) {\n  // Array of paths to search, similar to classpath\n  const searchPaths = [\n    __dirname,  // Current directory\n    '/over/here',  // Additional path\n    ...process.env.NODE_PATH.split(':')  // Paths from NODE_PATH\n  ];\n\n  for (const path of searchPaths) {\n    const require = createRequire(`${path}/`);\n    try {\n      return require(`./${moduleName}`);\n    } catch (error) {\n      if (error.code !== 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND') {\n        throw error;\n      }\n      // Module not found in this path, continue to next\n    }\n  }\n  throw new Error(`Module ${moduleName} not found in search paths`);\n}\n\n// Usage\ntry {\n  const moduleB = loadModule('B');\n  moduleB.someFunction();\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error('Error:', error.message);\n}\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n\n1. We define an array of paths to search, including the current directory, an additional specified path, and any paths from NODE_PATH.\n\n2. We iterate through these paths, attempting to require the module from each location.\n\n3. If the module is found, it's returned. If not, we move to the next path.\n\n4. If the module isn't found in any path, we throw an error.\n\nThis approach allows you to:\n\n- Specify multiple search paths, similar to how you'd specify multiple directories in a Java classpath.\n- Use the NODE_PATH environment variable to add additional search paths at runtime.\n- Load modules dynamically without knowing their exact location beforehand.\n\nTo use this:\n\n1. Set up your NODE_PATH:\n   ```bash\n   export NODE_PATH=/over/here:/another/path\n   ```\n\n2. Run your script:\n   ```bash\n   node A.js\n   ```\n\nThis method provides a flexible way to search for modules in multiple locations, conceptually similar to how Java searches the classpath.

We define a `loadModule` function that takes a module name and a classpath array.\n\n2. The function iterates through the classpath, attempting to require the module from each location.\n\n3. We use `createRequire` with a dummy path to create a require function for each classpath entry. This allows us to use relative paths within each classpath directory.\n\n4. If the module is found, it's returned. If not, we move to the next path in the classpath.\n\n5. If the module isn't found in any path, we throw an error.\n\n6. In the `main` function, we load modules B and C using our custom `loadModule` function, passing in the classpath array.\n\nTo use this script:\n\n```bash\nnode A.js -cp /over/there/:/over/here/\n```\n\n(You'd need to add argument parsing to populate the `cp` array from the command line input.)\n\nThis approach allows you to:\n\n- Specify multiple search paths via command line arguments, similar to Java's classpath.\n- Load modules from different locations without hardcoding their paths in your application.\n- Mimic the behavior of a classpath in a Node.js environment.\n\nRemember that this approach works for CommonJS modules (`require`).

We introduce a `moduleCache` Map to store loaded modules.\n\n2. In the `loadModule` function, we first check if the module is already in the cache. If it is, we return the cached module without attempting to load it again.\n\n3. When a module is successfully loaded, we store it in the cache before returning it.\n\n4. We've added some console.log statements to show when a module is loaded from the filesystem vs. from the cache.\n\nThis approach provides several benefits:\n\n- It prevents unnecessary reloading of modules, improving performance.\n- It ensures that multiple requests for the same module return the same instance, maintaining consistency in your application.\n- It mimics Node.js's native module caching behavior within our custom classpath-like system.\n\nFor ES modules, the approach would be similar, but we'd need to make the `loadModule` function asynchronous:\n\n```javascript\nconst moduleCache = new Map();\n\nasync function loadModule(moduleName, classpath) {\n    if (moduleCache.has(moduleName)) {\n        console.log(`Module ${moduleName} loaded from cache`);\n        return moduleCache.get(moduleName);\n    }\n\n    for (const path of classpath) {\n        try {\n            const modulePath = new URL(`file://${join(path, moduleName)}.js`).href;\n            const module = await import(modulePath);\n            moduleCache.set(moduleName, module);\n            console.log(`Module ${moduleName} loaded from ${path} and cached`);\n            return module;\n        } catch (error) {\n            if (error.code !== 'ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND') {\n                throw error;\n            }\n            // Module not found in this path, continue to next\n        }\n    }\n    throw new Error(`Module ${moduleName} not found in provided classpath`);\n}\n```\n\nThis caching mechanism ensures that if a module is already known to the interpreter (i.e., it has been loaded before), it will simply return the cached version instead of loading it again. This approach can significantly improve performance, especially in larger applications where modules are frequently reused across different parts of the codebase.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-12T20:22:48.675149Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-12T20:22:48.675149Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "b9f0015c-c981-4257-b29d-d1e54b360b10", "text": "can you please refactor those last versions so that the module loading functionality is in a class `ModuleLoader` in the file `ModuleLoader.js` , called independently by A.js and B.js as required", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-10-03T20:27:06.271158Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-03T20:27:06.271158Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "6645a24a-ee89-4329-a8d4-c086e0ba562a", "text": " Certainly!

It provides methods for loading both CommonJS (`loadModule`) and ES modules (`loadESModule`).\n\n2. The `ModuleLoader` class maintains its own cache, allowing different instances to have separate caches if needed.\n\n3. A.js and B.js can independently create instances of `ModuleLoader` with their own classpaths.\n\n4. The `loadESModule` method is asynchronous, so it needs to be awaited when used.\n\nThis structure allows for more flexibility:\n\n- Each file can have its own `ModuleLoader` instance with a different classpath if needed.\n- The module loading logic is encapsulated and reusable.\n- It's easier to maintain and extend the module loading functionality in one place.\n\nRemember to run Node.js with the `--experimental-modules` flag if you're using an older version of Node.js that doesn't support ES modules by default.

You're right that Google uses a complex authentication system for accessing and downloading Gmail archives, which isn't easily replicated with simple tools like wget. Let's explore some options that can handle this complexity:\n\n1. Use Google's official tool: Google Takeout\n\nGoogle Takeout is designed to handle all the authentication and session management internally. Here's how you can use it:\n\n1. Go to Google Takeout (https://takeout.google.com/)\n2. Select only Gmail data\n3. Choose to export to Google Drive instead of downloading directly\n4. Use Google Drive's desktop client to download the archive\n\nThis method offloads the complex authentication to Google's own tools, which are designed to handle intermittent connections.\n\n2. Use a browser extension for download management\n\nBrowser extensions can integrate with your existing session and handle the authentication seamlessly. Some options:\n\n- DownThemAll! (Firefox, Chrome)\n- Chrono Download Manager (Chrome)\n\nThese extensions can often resume downloads and handle complex authentication without you needing to manage cookies or headers manually.\n\n3. Use a dedicated download manager with browser integration\n\nSome download managers can integrate with your browser to capture downloads, including all necessary cookies and authentication data. Examples include:\n\n- Internet Download Manager (Windows)\n- JDownloader (cross-platform)\n\nThese tools often have browser extensions that allow them to \"catch\" downloads and handle them with their more robust downloading capabilities.\n\n4. Use a programming approach with authenticated sessions\n\nIf you're comfortable with programming, you could use a language like Python with libraries that can handle browser-like sessions. Here's a basic outline:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter\nfrom requests.packages.urllib3.util.retry import Retry\n\ndef download_file(url, filename):\n    session = requests.Session()\n    retry = Retry(total=5, backoff_factor=0.1)\n    adapter = HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retry)\n    session.mount('http://', adapter)\n    session.mount('https://', adapter)\n    \n    # You'd need to set up authentication here, possibly using saved cookies\n    # session.cookies.update({'your_auth_cookie': 'value'})\n\n    response = session.get(url, stream=True)\n    with open(filename, 'wb') as f:\n        for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192): \n            if chunk:\n                f.write(chunk)\n\n# Usage\ndownload_file('your_gmail_archive_url', 'gmail_archive.zip')\n```\n\nThis script uses the `requests` library to create a session (maintaining cookies and authentication) and implements retry logic for handling connection issues.\n\n5. Use a headless browser automation tool\n\nTools like Selenium or Puppeteer can automate a full browser, handling all the authentication and session management just like you would manually. This is more complex to set up but can replicate your manual process exactly.\n\nGiven the complexity of Google's authentication system, I'd recommend starting with the Google Takeout to Google Drive method, as it's the most straightforward and uses Google's own tools to handle the authentication and transfer. If that doesn't work for your situation, the browser extension or dedicated download manager would be the next best options.\n\nWould you like more details on implementing any of these approaches?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-12T17:33:26.797924Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-12T17:33:26.797924Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "a9a648b2-9181-442a-96fc-d9f280c6db49", "text": "I need to download my email archives from gmail but I have a very unreliable internet connection. For downloading from simple URLs I would use wget -c and resume if the line dropped.

It also has quite a complicated URL and it looks like there is some kind of auth involved too.

Here's a more robust approach you can consider:\n\n1. Use a download manager: \nDownload managers are designed to handle interrupted downloads and complex URLs. They often support resuming downloads and can manage authentication.\n\nSome options to consider:\n\n- uGet (Linux, Windows, macOS)\n- JDownloader (cross-platform)\n- Free Download Manager (cross-platform)\n\nThese tools can often handle the authentication and resumption issues better than a browser.\n\n2. Use Google Takeout with Drive:\nInstead of directly downloading your Gmail archive, you can use Google Takeout to export your data to Google Drive. Then, you can use Google Drive's desktop client to sync the files. This method has several advantages:\n\n- The initial export happens on Google's servers, so your connection doesn't matter for that part.\n- Google Drive's sync client is designed to handle interruptions and resume uploads/downloads.\n- You can sync specific folders, allowing for more granular control.\n\n3. Use a script with the Gmail API:\nIf you're comfortable with programming, you could write a script using the Gmail API to download your emails in batches. This would allow you to implement your own resumption logic and error handling.\n\n4. Use a cloud-based downloader:\nSome services allow you to input a download link, and they'll download the file to their servers. Once complete, you can download from their servers, which might be more reliable. Be cautious with this method, as it involves sharing your Google account information with a third party.\n\n5. Consider a VPN:\nIf your connection issues are related to network instability rather than physical disconnections, a VPN might help maintain a more stable connection.\n\nBefore proceeding, ensure you have sufficient storage space for your Gmail archive, as these can be quite large.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these methods?

The `JSON.parse()` method throws a `SyntaxError` if the string is not valid JSON. It's a good practice to use a try-catch block when parsing JSON from an uncertain source:\n\n```javascript\ntry {\n  const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);\n  // Use obj here\n} catch (error) {\n  console.error('Invalid JSON string:', error);\n}\n```\n\n2. If you're reading JSON from a file, you might use it like this:\n\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\nfs.readFile('data.json', 'utf8', (err, data) => {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error('Error reading file:', err);\n    return;\n  }\n  try {\n    const obj = JSON.parse(data);\n    console.log(obj);\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Error parsing JSON:', error);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n3. If you're working with JSON responses in an HTTP request, most modern HTTP clients for Node.js (like `axios` or `node-fetch`) can automatically parse JSON responses for you.\n\n4.

It summarizes disk usage of each directory, recursively.\n2. `-h` option makes the output human-readable (e.g., 5.2G instead of 5242880).\n3. `-d 4` limits the depth to 4 levels of subdirectories.

We construct `EXCLUDE_ARGS` by adding `--exclude=` before each directory name. This is the correct syntax for `du`.\n\n3.

Here's the corrected version of `turtle2json.js`:\n\n```javascript\n// turtle2json.js\n\nimport N3Parser from '@rdfjs/parser-n3';\nimport { Readable } from 'stream';\nimport rdf from 'rdf-ext';\n\nexport class Fam {\n  constructor() {\n    this.parser = new N3Parser();\n    this.prefixes = {};\n    this.result = {};\n  }\n\n  // Parse the input Turtle string\n  async parse(turtleString) {\n    const input = Readable.from([turtleString]);\n    const quads = [];\n\n    for await (const quad of this.parser.import(input)) {\n      quads.push(quad);\n      if (quad.predicate.value === 'http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type') {\n        this.prefixes[quad.object.value.split(':')[0]] = quad.object.value.split(':')[1];\n      }\n    }\n\n    return quads;\n  }\n\n  // ... (rest of the class implementation remains the same)\n}\n```\n\nThe main changes are:\n1. We import `N3Parser` as the default export from '@rdfjs/parser-n3'.\n2. We import `rdf` from 'rdf-ext' for potential use with RDF/JS data model.\n\nYou'll need to install the required packages:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @rdfjs/parser-n3 rdf-ext\n```\n\nThe rest of the implementation remains the same. This should resolve the import error you encountered.\n\nQ1: Would you like me to explain the changes in more detail?\nQ2: Do you want to see an example of how to use this updated version?\nQ3: Are there any other RDF-related functionalities you'd like to add to this tool?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-18T12:35:47.498996Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-18T12:35:47.498996Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "80ed4043-e75d-4308-bed7-ac94101d7a26", "text": "please write a splitURI(uri) method that will look for the last bit of the URI to do this :\n\nsplitURI('http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#Project')\n\nreturns :\n\n{ namespace : 'http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#', term : 'Project'}\n\nsplitURI('http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name')\n\nreturns :\n\n{ namespace : 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/', term : 'name' }", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-18T13:04:49.818012Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-18T13:04:49.818012Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "46ba1cc0-dcff-4db6-9abe-4b6e7f9f1929", "text": "please write a splitURI(uri) method that will look for the last bit of the URI to do this :\n\nsplitURI('http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#Project')\n\nreturns :\n\n{ namespace : 'http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#', term : 'Project'}\n\nsplitURI('http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name')\n\nreturns :\n\n{ namespace : 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/', term : 'name' }", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-18T13:04:33.994279Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-18T13:04:33.994279Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "5e3c97ed-c728-4cf0-a80f-b7de9d134a06", "text": " Certainly!

It finds the last occurrence of '#' or '/' in the URI.\n2. If neither is found, it returns an object with an empty namespace and the whole URI as the term.\n3. Otherwise, it splits the URI at the found position:\n   - Everything up to and including the '#' or '/' becomes the namespace.\n   - Everything after becomes the term.\n\nYou can use this method in your `Fam` class or independently. Here's how you might use it:\n\n```javascript\nconst fam = new Fam();\n\nconsole.log(fam.splitURI('http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#Project'));\n// Output: { namespace: 'http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap#', term: 'Project' }\n\nconsole.log(fam.splitURI('http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name'));\n// Output: { namespace: 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/', term: 'name' }\n```\n\nThis method will work correctly for both your example cases and should handle most common URI formats in RDF.\n\nQ1: Would you like to see how we can integrate this `splitURI` method into the existing `processNode` method?\nQ2: Are there any edge cases for URIs that you'd like this method to handle specifically?\nQ3: Would you like to add any error handling or validation to this method?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-18T13:04:33.994279Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-18T13:04:33.994279Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "183eca34-7cbb-4894-8c8b-4330796df421", "text": " Certainly!

It finds the last occurrence of '#' and '/' in the URI.\n2. It determines the split point by taking the maximum of these two indices.\n3. If neither '#' nor '/' is found, it returns the whole URI as the term with an empty namespace.\n4.

document, I'll analyze the content and create two lists. Then I'll compare them to identify the differences.\n\nRDF Classes:\n1. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Agent>\n2. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Environment>\n3. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Goal>\n4. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Module>\n5. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Project>\n6. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Session>\n7. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Task>\n8. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/TaskList>\n\nOWL Classes:\n1. :SoftGoal\n2. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Agent>\n3. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Environment>\n4. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Goal>\n5. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Module>\n6. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Project>\n7. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Session>\n8. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Task>\n9. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/TaskList>\n\nDifferences between the two lists:\n\n1. The OWL Classes list includes \":SoftGoal\" which is not present in the RDF Classes list. This is because \":SoftGoal\" is defined as an OWL class (rdf:type owl:Class) and is a subclass of <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Goal>.\n\n2. All classes in the RDF Classes list are also present in the OWL Classes list. This is because in OWL, all classes are also considered RDF classes.\n\n3. The OWL Classes list is more specific in its classification, as it uses the owl:Class type to define classes, while the RDF Classes are inferred from their usage in the document (e.g., as domains or ranges of properties).\n\nIn summary, the main difference is the inclusion of the \":SoftGoal\" class in the OWL Classes list, which demonstrates the additional expressivity that OWL provides over basic RDF schemas.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-24T12:59:13.302423Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-24T12:59:13.302423Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "b8399911-4fd2-4638-b535-c8171dcf4687", "text": "Can you reorder the Turtle to put the top-level classes first, followed by any subclasses, followed by top-level properties, object then datatype the annotation, followed by their subproperties", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-24T13:08:52.091779Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-24T13:08:52.091779Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "2b83586a-d2cc-4942-9e21-ff118cdd214e", "text": " Certainly.

For example:\n\n- `hasGoal`, `logo`, and `name` now have `:ProjectElement` as their domain.\n- `duration`, `priority`, and `status` now have `:TimelinedElement` as their domain.\n\nThis approach has several benefits:\n\n1. It makes the ontology more concise and easier to read.\n2. It groups related classes together, making the structure of the ontology clearer.\n3. It's easier to maintain - if you need to add a new class that should have these properties, you just need to add it to the union class definition.\n\nRemember that using these union classes doesn't change the meaning of the ontology - it's just a more efficient way of expressing the same information. Tools that process this ontology will still understand that these properties apply to all the individual classes in the union.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-24T13:10:29.399519Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-24T13:10:29.399519Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "a1fb834a-5dbf-4401-bca9-065f05985f1a", "text": " Certainly!

"5af54cfa-b75c-4e2c-b5e8-33dc6655e1ea", "text": " To answer your question about a current PHP SPARQL store suitable for use with WordPress, I'll need to consider a few factors:\n\n<antThinking>This response will provide information about SPARQL stores and WordPress integration. It doesn't meet the criteria for an artifact as it's primarily informational and doesn't contain substantial code or complex content that would benefit from being in a separate window.</antThinking>\n\n1. Compatibility: The SPARQL store should be compatible with PHP, as WordPress is primarily built on PHP.\n\n2. Currency: You're asking for a \"reasonably current\" solution, so we'll focus on actively maintained projects.\n\n3. WordPress integration: The solution should be able to integrate well with WordPress, either directly or through plugins.\n\nGiven these criteria, here are a couple of options that might suit your needs:\n\n1. EasyRDF:\n   - EasyRDF is a PHP library designed to make it easy to consume and produce RDF.\n   - It includes a SPARQL client that can be used to query remote SPARQL endpoints.\n   - While not a full SPARQL store itself, it can be used to interact with external SPARQL endpoints from within WordPress.\n   - It's actively maintained and compatible with modern PHP versions.\n\n2. ARC2:\n   - ARC2 is a flexible RDF system for PHP that includes a SPARQL endpoint.\n   - It can be used to set up a local SPARQL store within your WordPress environment.\n   - While not as actively maintained as EasyRDF, it still receives updates and is widely used in the PHP/RDF community.\n\nFor WordPress integration, you might consider creating a custom plugin that utilizes one of these libraries to interact with SPARQL data and integrate it into your WordPress site.\n\nIt's worth noting that while these options can work with WordPress, they're not specifically designed for it.

It's great to hear that the project is still actively maintained and has progressed to version 3.1.0. The move to PHP 8 only is indeed a significant change.\n\nRegarding PHP 8, yes, I'm familiar with it. PHP 8 was a major update to the PHP language, introducing several new features and improvements. Here are some key points about PHP 8:\n\n1. JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation: This can provide performance improvements for certain types of applications.\n\n2. Union Types: Allows for more precise type declarations.\n\n3. Named Arguments: Improves code readability and flexibility when calling functions.\n\n4. Attributes: Provides a native way to add metadata to classes, without relying on docblock annotations.\n\n5. Match Expression: A more powerful and expressive version of the switch statement.\n\n6. Nullsafe Operator: Simplifies null checks in method calls.\n\n7. Improved Type System: Including mixed type, static return type, and more.\n\n8. Constructor Property Promotion: Simplifies the declaration of class properties.\n\n9. Improved Error Handling: With consistent error messages and exceptions.\n\nThe shift to PHP 8 only for ARC2 3.x likely allows the project to take advantage of these new features and optimizations. It also means that users of ARC2 3.x will need to ensure their WordPress installation (and server) supports PHP 8.\n\nFor a WordPress site looking to use ARC2 3.x, this would mean:\n\n1. Ensuring the web server runs PHP 8.0 or later.\n2. Verifying that WordPress itself is compatible with PHP 8 (which it should be for recent versions).\n3.

Here are some approaches you could consider:\n\n1. HTTP/HTTPS (using a simple web server):\n\n<antThinking>This code example is relatively short and primarily illustrative. It doesn't warrant a separate artifact and fits well within the conversational flow.</antThinking>\n\n```java\nimport com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer;\nimport com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpHandler;\nimport com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpExchange;\n\n// ... other imports\n\npublic class SimpleFileServer {\n    public void startServer() throws IOException {\n        int port = 8000;\n        HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(port), 0);\n        server.createContext(\"/\", new FileHandler());\n        server.setExecutor(null);\n        server.start();\n    }\n\n    class FileHandler implements HttpHandler {\n        @Override\n        public void handle(HttpExchange exchange) throws IOException {\n            // Implement file serving logic here\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis approach uses Java's built-in `HttpServer` to create a simple web server. You'd need to implement the file serving logic in the `FileHandler` class.\n\n2. FTP (using Apache Commons Net library):\n\nWhile not part of the core Java API, the Apache Commons Net library provides FTP functionality and is widely used in Android development.\n\n3. WebSocket:\n\nAndroid supports WebSocket communication, which could be used for real-time file transfer.\n\n4. Network Service Discovery (NSD):\n\n```java\nNsdManager nsdManager = (NsdManager) getSystemService(Context.NSD_SERVICE);\n```\n\nThis can be used to advertise your file transfer service on the local network.\n\n5. Wi-Fi Direct:\n\n```java\nWifiP2pManager manager = (WifiP2pManager) getSystemService(Context.WIFI_P2P_SERVICE);\n```\n\nThis allows direct Wi-Fi connections between devices without an access point.\n\n6. Nearby Connections API:\n\nWhile primarily for short-range communication, it can work over Wi-Fi as well.\n\nFor your use case, I would recommend either the HTTP server approach or using a library like Apache Commons Net for FTP. These are standard protocols that would be easy to interact with from a Linux PC.\n\nHere's a basic outline of how you might structure your app:\n\n1. Create a service to run your file server in the background.\n2. Implement file selection functionality in your main activity.\n3. When a file is selected, start the service and make the file available.\n4. Display connection information (IP address and port) to the user.\n5.

Android provides robust support for HTTP operations, including PUT and POST requests, through its built-in networking libraries. The most commonly used and recommended HTTP client for Android is `HttpURLConnection`, which is part of the standard Java API and supports all HTTP methods including PUT and POST.\n\nFor more advanced features and easier use, many developers prefer using third-party libraries like OkHttp or Retrofit. However, let's focus on the built-in solution first.\n\nHere's a basic example of how you can use `HttpURLConnection` to perform a PUT request:\n\n<antThinking>This code example is substantial and self-contained, demonstrating a complete HTTP PUT operation. It's likely that the user might want to modify or reuse this code, making it a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"http-put-example\" type=\"application/vnd.ant.code\" language=\"java\" title=\"HTTP PUT Request Example\">\nimport java.io.*;\nimport java.net.HttpURLConnection;\nimport java.net.URL;\n\npublic class HttpPutExample {\n    public static void putFile(String fileUrl, File file) {\n        try {\n            URL url = new URL(fileUrl);\n            HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();\n            connection.setDoOutput(true);\n            connection.setRequestMethod(\"PUT\");\n            connection.setRequestProperty(\"Content-Type\", \"application/octet-stream\");\n            connection.setRequestProperty(\"Content-Length\", String.valueOf(file.length()));\n\n            try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(file);\n                 OutputStream os = connection.getOutputStream()) {\n                byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];\n                int bytesRead;\n                while ((bytesRead = fileInputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n                    os.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);\n                }\n            }\n\n            int responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();\n            System.out.println(\"Response Code: \" + responseCode);\n\n            connection.disconnect();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        File file = new File(\"path/to/your/file\");\n        putFile(\"http://your-server-url/upload\", file);\n    }\n}\n</antArtifact>\n\nThis example demonstrates how to send a file using an HTTP PUT request. Here's a breakdown of what it does:\n\n1. It establishes a connection to the specified URL.\n2. Sets the request method to PUT.\n3. Sets appropriate headers, including Content-Type and Content-Length.\n4. Reads the file in chunks and writes it to the output stream of the connection.\n5. Checks the response code to see if the upload was successful.\n\nFor POST requests, the process is very similar. You would just change the `setRequestMethod(\"PUT\")` to `setRequestMethod(\"POST\")`.\n\nIf you prefer a more modern and feature-rich approach, you might consider using the OkHttp library. It's more efficient and easier to use for complex networking tasks. Here's how you might use OkHttp for a PUT request:\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"okhttp-put-example\" type=\"application/vnd.ant.code\" language=\"java\" title=\"OkHttp PUT Request Example\">\nimport okhttp3.*;\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class OkHttpPutExample {\n    private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();\n\n    public void putFile(String url, File file) throws IOException {\n        RequestBody requestBody = RequestBody.create(MediaType.parse(\"application/octet-stream\"), file);\n        Request request = new Request.Builder()\n                .url(url)\n                .put(requestBody)\n                .build();\n\n        try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {\n            if (!response.isSuccessful()) throw new IOException(\"Unexpected code \" + response);\n            System.out.println(response.body().string());\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\n        OkHttpPutExample example = new OkHttpPutExample();\n        File file = new File(\"path/to/your/file\");\n        example.putFile(\"http://your-server-url/upload\", file);\n    }\n}\n</antArtifact>\n\nTo use OkHttp, you'd need to add it to your project dependencies. In your app's `build.gradle` file, you would add:\n\n```gradle\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.10.0'\n}\n```\n\nBoth of these methods will allow you to push files from your Android device to a server. The choice between using the built-in `HttpURLConnection` and a library like OkHttp often comes down to personal preference and specific project requirements.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of these examples in more detail?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-20T20:25:06.419945Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-20T20:25:06.419945Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "dd654beb-d86d-4b86-be65-6daa32acb3b7", "text": "What would you recommend for a UI  in java on the android phone?

It's built using Electron, which is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies, typically targeting desktop operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\n2. Mobile Limitations: Electron applications don't natively run on Android. The architecture and runtime environment of Android are significantly different from desktop operating systems.\n\n3. No Official Mobile Version: There hasn't been an official initiative from the Pulsar-edit team to create an Android version of the editor.\n\n4. Alternative Approaches: While you can't run Pulsar-edit directly on Android, there are a few potential workarounds if you're looking for a similar experience on a mobile device:\n\n   - Use a remote desktop application to access a computer running Pulsar-edit.\n   - Consider using Android-compatible text editors that offer similar features, like code highlighting and plugin systems. Examples include DroidEdit or QuickEdit.\n   - For web development, you might look into browser-based IDEs that can run on Android, such as CodeSandbox or StackBlitz.\n\n5. Future Possibilities: As mobile devices become more powerful, we might see more desktop-class applications being ported to mobile platforms.

Potential Solutions:\n\n   a) Ensure all necessary build tools are installed:\n      On Ubuntu/Debian, you can run:\n      ```\n      sudo apt-get update\n      sudo apt-get install build-essential python3\n      ```\n\n   b) Update node-gyp:\n      ```\n      npm install -g node-gyp\n      ```\n\n   c) Clear npm cache and node_modules:\n      ```\n      npm cache clean --force\n      rm -rf node_modules\n      npm install\n      ```\n\n   d) Check your Node.js version compatibility:\n      The error shows you're using Node.js v16.20.2. Ensure this version is compatible with all your dependencies.\n\n   e) Update your C++ compiler:\n      If you're using an older version of GCC, try updating it:\n      ```\n      sudo apt-get install gcc-9 g++-9\n      export CC=gcc-9\n      export CXX=g++-9\n      ```\n\n   f) Manually install the problematic package:\n      Try installing superstring separately:\n      ```\n      npm install superstring\n      ```\n\n   g) If you're using NVM (Node Version Manager), try switching to a different Node.js version:\n      ```\n      nvm install 14\n      nvm use 14\n      npm install\n      ```\n\n4. Additional Troubleshooting:\n   If none of the above solutions work, you may need to investigate further. You could try:\n   - Looking at the full build log for more detailed error messages\n   - Checking if there are any known issues with the superstring package for your specific Node.js version\n   - Reaching out to the maintainers of the superstring package with the full error log\n\nRemember to back up your project before making significant changes. If you try any of these solutions, let me know the results, and we can further troubleshoot if needed.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-21T19:26:52.435511Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-21T19:26:52.435511Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "fa8ccf9e-9f1c-466a-9bc2-f9cd1a1b9cbe", "text": " Certainly! Let's create a package for Pulsar that loads a web page into a browser view and shows the path of clicked elements in the console. Here's an overview of the necessary components and relevant API calls, followed by the implementation.\n\nOverview:\n\n1. Package Structure:\n   - Main entry point (main.js)\n   - Web view class (web-view.js)\n   - Package metadata (package.json)\n\n2. Components:\n   - Custom element for the web view\n   - Command to open the web view\n   - Event listener for element clicks\n   - Function to get the element path\n\n3. Relevant API calls:\n   - atom.workspace.open() to open the custom view\n   - atom.commands.add() to register the command\n   - customElements.define() to define the custom element\n   - atom.notifications.addInfo() to show notifications\n\nNow, let's proceed with the implementation:\n\n<antThinking>This package implementation is substantial, self-contained, and likely to be modified or reused.

When an element is clicked, it calculates the path to that element and displays it in the Pulsar console and as a notification.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the main components:\n\n1. `main.js`: \n   - Registers the command to open the webview.\n   - Handles opening the webview in a new pane.\n\n2. `web-view.js`:\n   - Defines the custom `WebViewElement` class.\n   - Implements the `loadURL` method to load a web page.\n   - Injects JavaScript into the loaded page to listen for clicks and calculate element paths.\n   - Listens for messages from the injected script and logs the clicked element paths.\n\n3. `package.json`:\n   - Defines the package metadata and the activation command.\n\nTo use this package:\n\n1. Place these files in a new directory under your Pulsar packages directory.\n2. Run `apm link` in that directory to link the package to Pulsar.\n3. Restart Pulsar or reload the window.\n4. Use the command palette to run the \"Webview Element Path: Open\" command.\n\nThis will open a new pane with the webview loading example.com. Clicking on elements in the loaded page will log their paths to the console and show them as notifications.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of this implementation in more detail or suggest any enhancements?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-21T23:45:31.132107Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-21T23:45:31.132107Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "e0620398-f228-4ff6-b24b-8cc5783d679f", "text": "We should make a package for pulsar which will load a web page into a browser view.

are some issues with the webpack build process. Let's address them one by one:\n\n1. Warning about 'canvas' module:\nThis is likely because the 'canvas' module is an optional dependency for jsdom. For browser environments, we can ignore this warning or provide a mock implementation.\n\n2. Error about 'crypto' module:\nThis is a more serious issue. The 'crypto' module is a Node.js core module and isn't available in browser environments by default. We need to provide a polyfill or fallback for it.\n\nTo resolve these issues, let's modify the webpack configuration:\n\n1. Install the required dependencies:\n```\nnpm install --save-dev crypto-browserify\n```\n\n2. Update the webpack.config.js file:\n\n```javascript\nimport path from 'path';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'url';\nimport { createRequire } from 'module';\n\nconst require = createRequire(import.meta.url);\nconst __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);\nconst __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);\n\nexport default {\n  entry: './src/index.js',\n  output: {\n    filename: 'bundle.js',\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),\n  },\n  target: 'web',\n  resolve: {\n    extensions: ['.js', '.json'],\n    fallback: {\n      \"fs\": false,\n      \"path\": require.resolve(\"path-browserify\"),\n      \"http\": require.resolve(\"stream-http\"),\n      \"https\": require.resolve(\"https-browserify\"),\n      \"stream\": require.resolve(\"stream-browserify\"),\n      \"util\": require.resolve(\"util/\"),\n      \"zlib\": require.resolve(\"browserify-zlib\"),\n      \"os\": require.resolve(\"os-browserify/browser\"),\n      \"vm\": require.resolve(\"vm-browserify\"),\n      \"url\": require.resolve(\"url/\"),\n      \"net\": false,\n      \"tls\": false,\n      \"child_process\": false,\n      \"crypto\": require.resolve(\"crypto-browserify\"), // Add this line\n    },\n  },\n  // Add this section to provide a mock for the 'canvas' module\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /canvas/,\n        use: 'null-loader'\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n};\n```\n\n3. Install null-loader:\n```\nnpm install --save-dev null-loader\n```\n\nAfter making these changes, try running the build command again:\n\n```\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis should resolve the crypto-related error and provide a mock for the canvas module.\n\nQ1: Are there any specific features of jsdom that you're using that might require the 'canvas' module?\nQ2: Is your application intended to run in a browser environment, or is it a Node.js application?\nQ3: Are there any other Node.js core modules that you're using in your application that might need polyfills for browser environments?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-26T20:14:17.376577Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-26T20:14:17.376577Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "345be4c5-682c-4d4f-98b5-89ae1bee5ba1", "name": "Webpack module loading issue with foaf-form.html", "created_at": "2024-10-01T14:21:52.634545Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T19:40:29.351764Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "f25d0bbf-ccb8-40b2-9b06-07725359d20f", "text": "This is what extract.js looks like before bundling.

The error message you're seeing is related to webpack's module loading process. Let's investigate and address this issue step by step.\n\n1. First, let's check the browser-entry.js file to ensure it's exporting the correct module:\n\n```javascript\nimport { extract } from './public/extractor.js';\n\nconst FormAMatic = {\n    extract: extract\n};\n\nif (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n    window.FormAMatic = FormAMatic;\n    window.extract = extract;\n}\n\nexport default FormAMatic;\n```\n\nThis looks correct. The module is being exported properly.\n\n2. Now, let's modify the webpack.config.js to ensure it's configured correctly for this setup:\n\n```javascript\nimport webpack from 'webpack';\nimport path from 'path';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'url';\n\nconst __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);\nconst __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);\n\nexport default {\n    entry: './src/browser-entry.js',\n    output: {\n        filename: 'main.bundle.js',\n        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/public/webpack'),\n        library: {\n            name: 'FormAMatic',\n            type: 'umd',\n            export: 'default'\n        },\n        globalObject: 'this'\n    },\n    mode: 'development',\n    target: 'web',\n    resolve: {\n        fallback: {\n            \"stream\": require.resolve(\"stream-browserify\"),\n            \"buffer\": require.resolve(\"buffer/\")\n        }\n    },\n    plugins: [\n        new webpack.ProvidePlugin({\n            process: 'process/browser',\n            Buffer: ['buffer', 'Buffer']\n        })\n    ],\n    module: {\n        rules: [\n            {\n                test: /\\.js$/,\n                exclude: /node_modules/,\n                use: {\n                    loader: 'babel-loader',\n                    options: {\n                        presets: ['@babel/preset-env']\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n};\n```\n\n3. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-loader buffer process stream-browserify\n```\n\n4. Update the foaf-form.html to load the bundle correctly:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>FOAF Form</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <!-- Your form content here -->\n\n    <script src=\"webpack/main.bundle.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n            if (typeof FormAMatic !== 'undefined' && typeof FormAMatic.extract === 'function') {\n                // Your form submission logic here\n                console.log('FormAMatic loaded successfully');\n            } else {\n                console.error('FormAMatic not loaded correctly');\n            }\n        });\n    </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n5. Rebuild the project:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThese changes should resolve the module loading issues. The webpack configuration has been updated to handle the necessary polyfills and ensure proper bundling for browser usage.\n\nQ1: Are there any specific error messages in the browser console after implementing these changes?\nQ2: Does the FormAMatic object appear in the global scope when you check `window.FormAMatic` in the browser console?\nQ3: Are there any network errors when loading the main.bundle.js file in the browser?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T14:22:25.333339Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T14:22:25.333339Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "d844ee7b-3b65-4603-af43-47f2e7585bba", "text": " Thank you for providing the updated error messages. It seems the issue persists, but we have more specific information now. Let's address these errors step by step:\n\n1. The first error suggests that webpack is trying to access a 'default' property of an undefined object. This typically happens when there's a mismatch between how the module is exported and how it's being imported.\n\n2. Let's modify the browser-entry.js file to ensure it's exporting correctly:\n\n```javascript\nimport { extract } from './public/extractor.js';\n\nconst FormAMatic = {\n    extract: extract\n};\n\nif (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n    window.FormAMatic = FormAMatic;\n    window.extract = extract;\n}\n\nexport { FormAMatic };  // Change this line\n```\n\n3. Update the webpack.config.js to reflect this change:\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n    // ... other configurations ...\n    output: {\n        filename: 'main.bundle.js',\n        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/public/webpack'),\n        library: {\n            name: 'FormAMatic',\n            type: 'umd',\n            export: 'FormAMatic'  // Change this line\n        },\n        globalObject: 'this'\n    },\n    // ... rest of the configuration ...\n};\n```\n\n4. In the foaf-form.html, update the script to use the new export:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"webpack/main.bundle.js\"></script>\n<script>\n    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n        if (typeof FormAMatic !== 'undefined' && typeof FormAMatic.extract === 'function') {\n            console.log('FormAMatic loaded successfully');\n            window.extract = FormAMatic.extract;  // Ensure extract is available globally\n        } else {\n            console.error('FormAMatic not loaded correctly');\n        }\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\n5. Ensure that the extractor.js file is exporting the extract function correctly:\n\n```javascript\n// In extractor.js\nexport function extract(document) {\n    // ... implementation ...\n}\n```\n\n6. Rebuild the project:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n7. After rebuilding, check the contents of the main.bundle.js file to ensure it contains the FormAMatic object and the extract function.\n\nThese changes should resolve the 'undefined' errors and make the FormAMatic object available globally.\n\nQ1: After implementing these changes, does the console still show the \"FormAMatic not loaded correctly\" error?\nQ2: Can you check if the main.bundle.js file is being loaded correctly by looking at the Network tab in your browser's developer tools?\nQ3: If you type `FormAMatic` in the browser console after the page loads, what is the output?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T14:30:43.008184Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T14:30:43.008184Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "529f40cb-088f-4d4c-95f6-87eacf10ebb2", "text": "I've made those changes.

The key changes are:\n\n- We're now using `export default` in `browser-entry.js`\n- We've updated the webpack config to use `export: 'default'`\n- We're accessing `window.FormAMatic` in the HTML file\n\nIf you're still encountering issues, we may need to investigate further.\n\nQ1: After implementing these changes, what does the browser console output when you load the page?\nQ2: Can you check the Network tab in your browser's developer tools to confirm that `main.bundle.js` is loading without any errors?\nQ3: If you type `window.FormAMatic` in the browser console after the page loads, what is the output?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T19:13:45.565062Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T19:13:45.565062Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "33b6ca33-8770-48b6-ae57-cf86c758ba97", "text": " I apologize for the persisting error. It seems the issue is still related to how webpack is bundling and exporting the module. Let's try a different approach to resolve this.\n\n1. First, let's modify the `browser-entry.js` file to use a more straightforward export:\n\n```javascript\nimport { extract } from './public/extractor.js';\n\nconst FormAMatic = {\n    extract: extract\n};\n\nif (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n    window.FormAMatic = FormAMatic;\n    window.extract = extract;\n}\n\nexport default FormAMatic;\n```\n\n2. Now, let's update the `webpack.config.js` to use a simpler configuration:\n\n```javascript\nimport path from 'path';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'url';\nimport webpack from 'webpack';\n\nconst __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);\nconst __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);\n\nexport default {\n    entry: './src/browser-entry.js',\n    output: {\n        filename: 'main.bundle.js',\n        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/public/webpack'),\n        library: 'FormAMatic',\n        libraryTarget: 'umd',\n        globalObject: 'this'\n    },\n    mode: 'development',\n    target: 'web',\n    resolve: {\n        fallback: {\n            \"stream\": require.resolve(\"stream-browserify\"),\n            \"buffer\": require.resolve(\"buffer/\")\n        }\n    },\n    plugins: [\n        new webpack.ProvidePlugin({\n            process: 'process/browser',\n            Buffer: ['buffer', 'Buffer']\n        })\n    ],\n    module: {\n        rules: [\n            {\n                test: /\\.js$/,\n                exclude: /node_modules/,\n                use: {\n                    loader: 'babel-loader',\n                    options: {\n                        presets: ['@babel/preset-env']\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n};\n```\n\n3. In the `foaf-form.html`, let's modify the script to check for the FormAMatic object:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"webpack/main.bundle.js\"></script>\n<script>\n    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n        if (typeof FormAMatic === 'object' && typeof FormAMatic.extract === 'function') {\n            console.log('FormAMatic loaded successfully');\n            window.extract = FormAMatic.extract;  // Ensure extract is available globally\n        } else {\n            console.error('FormAMatic not loaded correctly', FormAMatic);\n        }\n    });\n</script>\n```\n\n4. Rebuild the project:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n5. After rebuilding, open the `main.bundle.js` file and check its contents. At the very end of the file, you should see something like:\n\n```javascript\nreturn __webpack_exports__;\n})()\n;\n//# sourceMappingURL=main.bundle.js.map\n```\n\nIf you don't see this, there might be an issue with the bundling process.\n\n6. If the issue persists, try adding a `console.log` statement in the `browser-entry.js` file to check if it's being executed:\n\n```javascript\nconsole.log('browser-entry.js is being executed');\n```\n\nThese changes should help resolve the 'undefined' error and properly export the FormAMatic object.\n\nQ1: After these changes, what does the browser console show when you load the page?\nQ2: Can you confirm that the `main.bundle.js` file is being loaded correctly in the Network tab of your browser's developer tools?\nQ3: If you type `FormAMatic` in the browser console after the page loads, what is the output now?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T19:13:35.761810Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T19:13:35.761810Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "3d108ba0-5116-4cd1-89ec-af69b7d9d2b3", "text": " Based on the current structure of your `extract.js` file, you're exporting the `extract` function correctly. However, to ensure compatibility with both ES modules and CommonJS, and to make it work seamlessly with webpack, we should make a few adjustments:\n\n1. First, let's modify the export at the bottom of the file:\n\n```javascript\nconst extractor = new RDFExtractor(rdf, N3Writer);\nconst extract = (document) => extractor.extract(document);\n\nexport { extract };\nexport default extract;\n```\n\nThis change allows for both named and default imports.\n\n2. In your `browser-entry.js` file, update the import statement:\n\n```javascript\nimport extract from './public/extractor.js';\n\nconst FormAMatic = {\n    extract: extract\n};\n\nif (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n    window.FormAMatic = FormAMatic;\n    window.extract = extract;\n}\n\nexport default FormAMatic;\n```\n\n3. In your webpack config, ensure you have the correct configuration for handling ES6 modules:\n\n```javascript\nmodule: {\n    rules: [\n        {\n            test: /\\.js$/,\n            exclude: /node_modules/,\n            use: {\n                loader: 'babel-loader',\n                options: {\n                    presets: ['@babel/preset-env']\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n},\nresolve: {\n    extensions: ['.js', '.json'],\n    fallback: {\n        // ... your fallbacks\n    }\n}\n```\n\n4.

Update the `package.json` to include:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"module\",\n  // ... other configurations\n}\n```\n\n2.

We've reverted back to using `require.resolve()` for the fallback paths. This is because webpack expects these to be strings representing the paths to the modules.\n\n2.

It seems the issue is occurring within the `extractor.js` file, specifically in the `extractDataAttributes` method. Let's review and fix this issue.\n\n1. First, let's look at the relevant part of the `extractor.js` file:\n\n```javascript\nclass FormDataExtractor {\n    extract(form) {\n        const elements = form.querySelectorAll('input, textarea');\n        const data = Array.from(elements).map(this.extractElementData);\n        return this.groupData(data);\n    }\n\n    extractElementData(element) {\n        const data = this.extractDataAttributes(element);\n        data.value = element.value;\n\n        if (element.tagName === 'FIELDSET') {\n            data.entries = this.extractFieldsetEntries(element);\n        }\n\n        return data;\n    }\n\n    extractDataAttributes(element) {\n        // ... implementation ...\n    }\n\n    // ... other methods ...\n}\n```\n\nThe error suggests that `this` is undefined when `extractDataAttributes` is called. This is likely because the context is lost when `extractElementData` is used as a callback function in `Array.from(elements).map(this.extractElementData)`.\n\nTo fix this, we need to bind the correct `this` context. Here's how we can modify the `extract` method:\n\n```javascript\nclass FormDataExtractor {\n    extract(form) {\n        const elements = form.querySelectorAll('input, textarea');\n        const data = Array.from(elements).map(element => this.extractElementData(element));\n        return this.groupData(data);\n    }\n\n    // ... rest of the class remains the same ...\n}\n```\n\n2. Now, let's update the `RDFExtractor` class to use this `FormDataExtractor`:\n\n```javascript\nclass RDFExtractor {\n    constructor(rdf, N3Writer) {\n        this.rdf = rdf;\n        this.formDataExtractor = new FormDataExtractor();\n        this.nodeCreator = new RDFNodeCreator(rdf);\n        this.datasetBuilder = new DatasetBuilder(rdf, this.nodeCreator);\n        this.turtleSerializer = new TurtleSerializer(N3Writer);\n    }\n\n    async extract(document) {\n        try {\n            const form = document.querySelector('form');\n            const data = this.formDataExtractor.extract(form);\n            const dataset = this.datasetBuilder.build(data);\n            return await this.turtleSerializer.serialize(dataset);\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.error('Extraction failed:', error);\n            throw error;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. Finally, let's update the export at the bottom of the file:\n\n```javascript\nconst extractor = new RDFExtractor(rdf, N3Writer);\nexport const extract = (document) => extractor.extract(document);\nexport default extract;\n```\n\nAfter making these changes, rebuild your project:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThese modifications should resolve the \"Cannot read properties of undefined\" error by ensuring that the correct `this` context is maintained throughout the extraction process.\n\nQ1: After implementing these changes and rebuilding, does the extraction process work without throwing the previous error?\nQ2: Are there any new console errors or warnings when you try to use the `extract` function in the browser?\nQ3: Can you confirm that the `FormAMatic` object is now available in the global scope (window) and contains the `extract` method?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T19:40:29.351764Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T19:40:29.351764Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "61747eac-16f4-4107-b6ce-54aa35817311", "name": "Splitting Strings into Type and Subtype", "created_at": "2024-09-21T20:12:58.725719Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-21T20:13:29.814846Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "c630876c-8575-4c1b-8417-cb3e54d7c492", "text": "I'd like to split a string eg. const s = 'foo:bar' such that \nmarker.type = 'foo'\nmarker.subtype = 'bar'\nif there is no colon, eg. const s = 'baz'\nmarker.type = 'baz'\nmarker.subtype = undefined", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-21T20:13:21.274406Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-21T20:13:21.274406Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "93ffb5e6-6cd9-42b1-af04-a42a354d8b1a", "text": " Here's a concise JavaScript function to split a string as per your requirements:\n\n```javascript\nfunction splitMarker(s) {\n  const [type, subtype] = s.split(':');\n  return {\n    type,\n    subtype: subtype || undefined\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage\nconst marker = splitMarker('foo:bar');\nconsole.log(marker); // { type: 'foo', subtype: 'bar' }\n\nconst markerNoSubtype = splitMarker('baz');\nconsole.log(markerNoSubtype); // { type: 'baz', subtype: undefined }\n```\n\nThis function uses array destructuring to assign the split parts to `type` and `subtype`.

JSON.stringify(value) : value;\n    });\n\n    return { label, input };\n  }\n\n  // Create form elements for a set of properties\n  createFormElements(properties) {\n    const fragment = this.document.createDocumentFragment();\n\n    properties.forEach(property => {\n      const { label, input } = this.createFormElement(property);\n      fragment.appendChild(label);\n      fragment.appendChild(input);\n      fragment.appendChild(this.document.createElement('br'));\n\n      // Handle nested properties\n      if (property.children && property.children.properties) {\n        const fieldset = this.document.createElement('fieldset');\n        const legend = this.document.createElement('legend');\n        legend.textContent = property.term;\n        fieldset.appendChild(legend);\n        fieldset.appendChild(this.createFormElements(property.children.properties));\n        fragment.appendChild(fieldset);\n      }\n    });\n\n    return fragment;\n  }\n\n  // Transform JSON to HTML form\n  jsonToHtmlForm(jsonData) {\n    const form = this.document.createElement('form');\n    form.appendChild(this.createFormElements(jsonData.ROOT.properties));\n    return form;\n  }\n\n  // Read JSON from file and transform to HTML form\n  async jsonFileToHtmlForm(filePath) {\n    try {\n      const jsonString = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');\n      const jsonData = JSON.parse(jsonString);\n      const formElement = this.jsonToHtmlForm(jsonData);\n      this.document.body.appendChild(formElement);\n      return this.dom.serialize();\n    } catch (error) {\n      console.error('Error reading or parsing JSON file:', error);\n      throw error;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nexport default JsonToHtmlForm;\n```\n\nTo use this class, you can create a new file, for example `index.js`, with the following content:\n\n```javascript\nimport JsonToHtmlForm from './JsonToHtmlForm.js';\n\nconst converter = new JsonToHtmlForm();\n\nconverter.jsonFileToHtmlForm('./path/to/your/json/file.json')\n  .then(htmlString => console.log(htmlString))\n  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));\n```\n\nThis implementation:\n1. Encapsulates all functionality in a `JsonToHtmlForm` class.\n2. Adds support for the \"INTEGER\" subtype.\n3. Includes a new `jsonFileToHtmlForm` method that reads JSON from a file, transforms it to an HTML form, and returns the serialized HTML.\n\nMake sure to adjust the file path in the `index.js` example to point to your actual JSON file.\n\nQ1: How would you modify this class to allow for custom styling of the generated form elements?\nQ2: What approach would you suggest for handling form submission and data validation?\nQ3: How could we extend this implementation to support more complex nested structures in the JSON input?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-21T21:23:53.547745Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-21T21:23:53.547745Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "41c217fe-11db-4f29-8529-ded473727dc9", "name": "Bookmarking Multiple Tabs in Android Chrome", "created_at": "2024-09-23T09:10:10.970916Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-23T09:23:38.665824Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "fc71b3f7-e0da-4e24-b161-21d313fbf92d", "text": "With Google Chrome browser on android 13, is there any way of bookmarking or otherwise saving all all tabs at once?

Tab Groups:\n   - You can create tab groups to organize and save related tabs together.\n   - To create a group, long-press on a tab and select \"Add to new group.\"\n   - You can then name the group and add other tabs to it.\n   - While this doesn't bookmark them, it helps manage large numbers of tabs.\n\n2. Recent Tabs:\n   - Chrome automatically saves your recently closed tabs.\n   - You can access these by tapping the three-dot menu and selecting \"Recent tabs.\"\n\n3. Third-party extensions:\n   - While Chrome for Android doesn't support extensions like the desktop version, there are some third-party apps that can help manage tabs across devices.\n\n4. Sync across devices:\n   - If you're signed into Chrome, your open tabs should sync across devices.\n   - You can access these from other devices where you're signed in.\n\n5. Manual workaround:\n   - Open the tab switcher (square icon next to the address bar).\n   - Take a screenshot of your open tabs.\n   - This at least gives you a visual reference of what you had open.\n\nGiven that you frequently have 100+ tabs open, you might want to consider periodically reviewing and closing unnecessary tabs to manage them more effectively.

Chrome Debug Bridge:\n   Chrome provides a remote debugging protocol that can be used to interact with the browser programmatically. However, this is primarily intended for development purposes and requires a computer connected to the Android device.\n\n2. Android Accessibility Services:\n   You could potentially create an Android app that uses Accessibility Services to read the content of the screen, including tab information. This approach is complex and requires careful implementation to comply with Google's policies.\n\n3. Android Debug Bridge (ADB):\n   Using ADB, you might be able to extract some information about running apps, including Chrome. This requires the device to be in developer mode and connected to a computer.\n\n4. Chrome Extensions:\n   On desktop Chrome, extensions can access tab information. However, Chrome for Android doesn't support extensions, so this isn't directly applicable.\n\n5. Chrome Sync API:\n   If the tabs are synced across devices, you might be able to access them through Chrome's sync API on a desktop device. This wouldn't directly access the tabs on the Android device but could provide a list of synced tabs.\n\n6. Custom Browser:\n   Creating a custom browser based on Chromium could allow you to access tab information, but this is a significant undertaking.\n\nIt's important to note that direct programmatic access to browser data on Android is intentionally limited for security reasons. Any solution would likely require either root access to the device or development of a custom application.\n\nIf you're considering developing a solution, you might want to look into creating an Android app that uses Android's Accessibility Services.

Here are some key points about this approach:\n\n1. Limitations:\n   - This method relies on the structure of Chrome's UI, which may change with updates.\n   - It may not capture all tabs if they're not visible in the current view.\n   - The user must grant accessibility permissions to your app, which some may be hesitant to do.\n\n2. Implementation:\n   - You'll need to create an XML file (e.g., `accessibility_service_config.xml`) in your `res/xml/` directory to configure the service.\n   - You must declare the service in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.\n\n3. Refinement needed:\n   - The `getTabInfo` method needs to be refined based on Chrome's actual UI structure.\n   - You may need to implement additional logic to ensure you're capturing data only when the tab switcher is open.\n\n4. Testing and permissions:\n   - Extensive testing is crucial to ensure reliability across different Chrome versions and device types.\n   - Your app must clearly communicate its purpose and the permissions it requires to comply with Google's policies.\n\n5. Alternative approaches:\n   - If this method proves unreliable, you might consider creating a custom keyboard that can be activated in Chrome to capture the current tab's information.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this implementation or discuss how to set up the necessary configurations in your Android project?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-23T09:16:19.448782Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-23T09:16:19.448782Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "5ed62155-048c-4243-9235-60a7aaf04ac8", "text": "This sounds promising, I'd like to explore this approach further.

Let's explore the custom keyboard idea as an alternative or complementary solution. It's an interesting approach that could provide a different way to capture tab information.\n\nThe custom keyboard approach would work as follows:\n\n1. Create a custom input method (keyboard) for Android.\n2. When activated in Chrome, it could provide a special key or combination to capture the current tab's information.\n3. The keyboard could then save this information or send it to your main app.\n\nHere's a basic outline of how you might implement this:\n\n<antThinking>This custom keyboard approach is a substantial, self-contained concept that the user might want to modify or expand upon.

Custom Key: The keyboard includes a custom key (primaryCode -10 in this example) that triggers the tab-saving function.\n\n2. Implementation: You'll need to create layout files for the keyboard (keyboard_view.xml) and define the keys (qwerty.xml).\n\n3. Capturing Tab Info: The `saveCurrentTabInfo()` method would need to be implemented. This could involve:\n   - Sending a broadcast to your main app, which then uses Android's accessibility features to read the current tab's information.\n   - Using Android's clipboard API to capture the current URL (if the user copies it).\n\n4. User Experience: Users would need to switch to your keyboard when they want to save a tab, which might be less convenient than an always-running accessibility service.\n\n5. Permissions: This approach requires fewer permissions than the accessibility service, which might make users more comfortable.\n\n6. Limitations: It can only capture information about the currently active tab, not all open tabs at once.\n\nAdvantages of this approach:\n- Less intrusive in terms of permissions\n- Gives users more control over when tab information is captured\n- Could be combined with other useful features for browsing\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Requires user action to switch keyboards\n- Can't capture all tabs at once\n- Limited to the active tab's visible information\n\nThis method could be used in conjunction with the Accessibility Service approach, giving users multiple ways to save their tab information based on their preferences and needs.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this custom keyboard implementation, or shall we return to discussing the Accessibility Service approach in more detail?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-23T09:19:05.236398Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-23T09:19:05.236398Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "8e3d0b7a-28a7-4e70-8bcf-01e434b4bf2a", "text": "Ok, thanks.

Tab Switcher View:\n   When the tab switcher is open, Chrome exposes a scrollable list of tab items. Each tab item typically contains:\n   - A title (usually the page title)\n   - A URL (often in the content description)\n   - A thumbnail of the page (as an image)\n\n2. Accessibility Node Structure:\n   The tab switcher view is usually structured as follows:\n   - A parent node representing the tab switcher\n   - Child nodes for each visible tab\n   - Each tab node containing text (title) and content description (URL) properties\n\n3. Specific Node IDs:\n   Chrome often uses specific resource IDs for its UI elements. Some relevant ones might include:\n   - `com.android.chrome:id/tab_switcher_recycler_view` for the tab list\n   - `com.android.chrome:id/tab_title` for individual tab titles\n   - `com.android.chrome:id/tab_url` for tab URLs (might be in content description)\n\n4. Limitations:\n   - Only visible tabs in the switcher view are readily accessible\n   - Scrolling might be necessary to access all tabs if there are many\n   - The exact structure and IDs can change between Chrome versions\n\n5. Potential API calls:\n   - `AccessibilityNodeInfo.findAccessibilityNodeInfosByViewId()` to find the tab switcher\n   - `getChild()` to iterate through tab nodes\n   - `getText()` and `getContentDescription()` to get tab details\n\nBased on this information, here's an updated approach to capturing tab data:\n\n<antThinking>This updated approach for capturing tab data via the Accessibility API is substantial and self-contained. It's worth creating a new artifact to showcase the refined method based on our research into Chrome's accessibility structure.</antThinking>\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"chrome-tab-data-capture\" type=\"application/vnd.ant.code\" language=\"java\" title=\"Chrome Tab Data Capture via Accessibility API\">\nimport android.accessibilityservice.AccessibilityService;\nimport android.accessibilityservice.AccessibilityServiceInfo;\nimport android.view.accessibility.AccessibilityEvent;\nimport android.view.accessibility.AccessibilityNodeInfo;\nimport android.util.Log;\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class ChromeTabCaptureService extends AccessibilityService {\n    private static final String TAG = \"ChromeTabCaptureService\";\n    private static final String CHROME_PACKAGE = \"com.android.chrome\";\n    private static final String TAB_SWITCHER_ID = \"com.android.chrome:id/tab_switcher_recycler_view\";\n\n    @Override\n    public void onAccessibilityEvent(AccessibilityEvent event) {\n        if (event.getPackageName() != null && event.getPackageName().toString().equals(CHROME_PACKAGE)) {\n            if (event.getEventType() == AccessibilityEvent.TYPE_WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED) {\n                captureTabData();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void captureTabData() {\n        AccessibilityNodeInfo rootNode = getRootInActiveWindow();\n        if (rootNode == null) return;\n\n        List<AccessibilityNodeInfo> tabSwitcherNodes = rootNode.findAccessibilityNodeInfosByViewId(TAB_SWITCHER_ID);\n        if (tabSwitcherNodes.isEmpty()) {\n            Log.d(TAG, \"Tab switcher not found\");\n            rootNode.recycle();\n            return;\n        }\n\n        AccessibilityNodeInfo tabSwitcher = tabSwitcherNodes.get(0);\n        List<TabInfo> tabInfoList = new ArrayList<>();\n\n        for (int i = 0; i < tabSwitcher.getChildCount(); i++) {\n            AccessibilityNodeInfo tabNode = tabSwitcher.getChild(i);\n            if (tabNode != null) {\n                String title = tabNode.getText() != null ? tabNode.getText().toString() : \"\";\n                String url = tabNode.getContentDescription() != null ? tabNode.getContentDescription().toString() : \"\";\n                tabInfoList.add(new TabInfo(title, url));\n                tabNode.recycle();\n            }\n        }\n\n        tabSwitcher.recycle();\n        rootNode.recycle();\n\n        // Process the captured tab data\n        processTabInfo(tabInfoList);\n    }\n\n    private void processTabInfo(List<TabInfo> tabInfoList) {\n        // Here you would implement the logic to save or transmit the tab data\n        // For example, saving to a file or sending to another component of your app\n        for (TabInfo info : tabInfoList) {\n            Log.d(TAG, \"Tab: \" + info.title + \" - \" + info.url);\n        }\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onInterrupt() {\n        Log.w(TAG, \"ChromeTabCaptureService interrupted\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onServiceConnected() {\n        super.onServiceConnected();\n        AccessibilityServiceInfo info = new AccessibilityServiceInfo();\n        info.eventTypes = AccessibilityEvent.TYPE_WINDOW_STATE_CHANGED;\n        info.packageNames = new String[]{CHROME_PACKAGE};\n        info.feedbackType = AccessibilityServiceInfo.FEEDBACK_GENERIC;\n        setServiceInfo(info);\n        Log.i(TAG, \"ChromeTabCaptureService connected\");\n    }\n\n    private static class TabInfo {\n        String title;\n        String url;\n\n        TabInfo(String title, String url) {\n            this.title = title;\n            this.url = url;\n        }\n    }\n}\n</antArtifact>\n\nThis updated implementation takes into account what we know about Chrome's accessibility structure. Here are some key points:\n\n1. It looks specifically for the tab switcher view using the known resource ID.\n2. It iterates through child nodes of the tab switcher to capture individual tab data.\n3. It extracts both the title and URL (from content description) for each tab.\n4. The captured data is stored in a `TabInfo` object for easy handling.\n\nTo use this effectively:\n\n1. Ensure the tab switcher is open in Chrome when you want to capture data.\n2. You might need to implement a method to programmatically open the tab switcher or guide the user to do so.\n3. Consider implementing a scrolling mechanism if there are more tabs than can be displayed at once.\n4. Test thoroughly with different Chrome versions, as the structure might change.\n\nRemember that this approach still has limitations:\n- It only captures tabs visible in the current view of the tab switcher.\n- The exact structure and IDs might change in future Chrome updates.\n- It requires the user to grant accessibility permissions to your app.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of this implementation in more detail, or discuss how to handle potential edge cases or limitations?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-23T09:23:38.665824Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-23T09:23:38.665824Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "9e7876b8-e3a4-4677-a9d8-ffe1127196db", "name": "Importing D3 Functions in Node.js", "created_at": "2024-09-19T12:36:20.154398Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-19T17:14:08.370887Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "574af5df-7264-4ae6-9d55-4084f9eef8bc", "text": "I forgot the source, sorry.

You're correct that D3 is typically used in a browser environment, which is why it's trying to access the `document` object. To make this work in Node.js, we'll need to use a server-side rendering approach. We can use the `jsdom` library to simulate a DOM environment in Node.js.\n\nLet's refactor the code:\n\n1. First, install the required packages:\n\n```bash\nnpm install d3 jsdom\n```\n\n2. Now, let's modify the `viz-turtle.js` file:\n\n```javascript\nimport rdf from 'rdf-ext';\nimport { fromFile } from 'rdf-utils-fs';\nimport * as d3 from 'd3';\nimport { JSDOM } from 'jsdom';\nimport fs from 'fs/promises';\n\n// Create a virtual DOM\nconst dom = new JSDOM('<!DOCTYPE html><body></body>');\nglobal.document = dom.window.document;\nglobal.window = dom.window;\n\n// ...

Uses `jsdom` to create a virtual DOM environment.\n2. Modifies the `jsonldVis` function to return the SVG content as a string.\n3. Changes the `visualizeTurtle` function to write the SVG content to a file instead of trying to render it directly.\n\nNow, when you run `node viz-turtle.js`, it should process the Turtle file and generate an SVG file as output, which you can then open in a browser or SVG viewer.\n\nQ1: Do you need any additional file I/O operations or error handling in the script?\n\nQ2: Would you like to add command-line argument support for specifying input and output files?\n\nQ3: Are there any specific D3 visualizations or interactions you want to ensure are working in this server-side rendering approach?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-19T12:54:25.267276Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-19T12:54:25.267276Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "659b8b5e-9b33-4671-a4c5-820dba619fc9", "text": "node viz-turtle.js \nError generating visualization: TypeError: d3.tip is not a function", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-19T16:55:27.542359Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-19T16:55:27.542359Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "4efb1fbe-3869-4452-95ed-4d0aff631763", "text": " I apologize for the oversight.

Most problematic is procrastinating badly with the pension things I need to do. It's textbook ADHD stuff, biting me hard.\nWhy now? I suspect it may be the effect of the SSRI drug. I think it may be counter-productive. I have noticed minor annoying side effects, so it's definitely affecting me. But it seems to be amplifying the problem side of ADHD. Since I started on it I've been finding it harder than ever to stay focused, very prone to getting distracted. \nIt's meant to be reducing my anxiety, but that's only been a real problem recently on the UK trips. The Ritalin has reduced my anxiety (and depression) a lot under normal circumstances when I've been here. But since taking the SSRI I have been getting stressed again, because I can't focus. \nI believe this kind of drug takes time to settle, but it has been a few weeks now (I've stayed on 1/2 dose longer than the week Montalbano prescribed because the side effects were a bit unnerving).

Attractive or good-looking: It's often used to describe an attractive person, especially in a somewhat casual or cheeky way. For example, \"That new bartender is pretty tasty!\"\n\n2. Impressive or excellent: It can be used to describe something that's particularly good or impressive. For instance, \"Did you see his new car? It's a tasty little number!\"\n\n3. Difficult or challenging: In some contexts, particularly related to sports or confrontations, \"tasty\" can mean tough or potentially violent. For example, \"The match is going to be tasty - the two teams really don't like each other.\"\n\n4. Expensive or high-quality: Sometimes it's used to describe something that's of high value or quality. \"He's got a tasty job in the City\" might mean a well-paying job in London's financial district.\n\n5. Risky or dangerous: In certain contexts, it might describe a situation that's potentially hazardous or tricky. \"Things got a bit tasty when the police showed up at the party.\"\n\nThe exact meaning often depends on the context in which it's used.

For example, \"That new actor in the movie is pretty tasty.\"\n\n2. Cool or impressive: It might be used to describe something that's particularly good or impressive, though this is less common than in UK slang. \"Check out his new guitar - it's a tasty piece of gear.\"\n\n3. Lucrative or profitable: In business contexts, a \"tasty deal\" might refer to a very profitable opportunity.\n\n4. Exciting or intense: In sports or competitive contexts, a \"tasty matchup\" could mean an exciting or intense competition.\n\n5. Risky or dangerous: Though less common, it can sometimes be used to describe a risky situation, similar to the UK usage.\n\nIt's worth noting that these slang uses are generally less prevalent and may be considered a bit dated in US English compared to UK English.

Separation of Concerns: We've created a `FormElementFactory` class to handle the creation of form elements. This separates the logic for creating individual form elements from the overall form creation process.\n\n2. Improved Readability: Methods are smaller and more focused, making the code easier to read and understand.\n\n3. Better Extensibility: If we need to add new types of form elements or modify existing ones, we can do so in the `FormElementFactory` class without affecting the rest of the code.\n\n4. Reduced Duplication: Common operations like creating labels and buttons are now in separate methods, reducing code duplication.\n\n5. Improved Structure: The `JsonToHtmlForm` class now has a clearer structure with methods for each major step in the form creation process.\n\nQ1: How does this refactoring improve the maintainability of the code?\nQ2: What potential performance implications might this refactoring have?\nQ3: How could we further improve the error handling in this refactored version?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T13:35:59.906505Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T13:35:59.906505Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "9e5149fc-b969-4504-ab43-14a08a977564", "text": "Error reading or parsing JSON file: TypeError: Cannot set property type of #<HTMLTextAreaElement> which has only a getter\n    at FormElementFactory.setInputAttributes (file:///home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/packages/farelo/form-a-matic/src/json-to-html.js:41:28)", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-10-01T13:37:30.855519Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T13:37:30.855519Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "f2adea8e-e040-4d76-a9fa-cbae8f5926f4", "text": " Thank you for providing the error message. This error is occurring because we're trying to set the 'type' property on a textarea element, which doesn't have a settable 'type' property. Let's fix this issue and improve our error handling. Here's an updated version of the `FormElementFactory` class:\n\n```javascript\nclass FormElementFactory {\n    constructor(document) {\n        this.document = document;\n    }\n\n    createElement(property) {\n        const label = this.createLabel(property.term);\n        const input = this.createInput(property);\n        return this.wrapInFormGroup(label, input);\n    }\n\n    createLabel(text) {\n        const label = this.document.createElement('label');\n        label.textContent = text;\n        return label;\n    }\n\n    createInput(property) {\n        if (property.type === 'BNODE' && property.children) {\n            return this.createFieldset(property);\n        }\n\n        const inputElement = this.getInputElement(property);\n        this.setInputAttributes(inputElement, property);\n        return inputElement;\n    }\n\n    getInputElement(property) {\n        if (property.type === 'LITERAL') {\n            if (property.subtype === 'BOOLEAN') {\n                const input = this.document.createElement('input');\n                input.type = 'checkbox';\n                return input;\n            } else if (property.subtype === 'INTEGER') {\n                const input = this.document.createElement('input');\n                input.type = 'number';\n                return input;\n            }\n        }\n        \n        if (property.type === 'LITERAL' || property.type === 'URI') {\n            return this.document.createElement('textarea');\n        }\n\n        const input = this.document.createElement('input');\n        input.type = 'text';\n        return input;\n    }\n\n    setInputAttributes(input, property) {\n        Object.entries(property).forEach(([key, value]) => {\n            if (key !== 'type' && key !== 'subtype') {\n                input.dataset[key] = typeof value === 'object' ? JSON.stringify(value) : value;\n            }\n        });\n    }\n\n    // ... (rest of the methods remain the same)\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's improve error handling in the `JsonToHtmlForm` class:\n\n```javascript\nclass JsonToHtmlForm {\n    // ... (other methods remain the same)\n\n    async jsonFileToHtmlForm(templatePath, filePath) {\n        try {\n            await this.initDOM(templatePath);\n\n            const jsonString = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');\n            const jsonData = JSON.parse(jsonString);\n\n            if (!jsonData || !jsonData.ROOT || !Array.isArray(jsonData.ROOT.properties)) {\n                throw new Error('Invalid JSON structure: ROOT.properties array is missing');\n            }\n\n            const formElement = this.jsonToHtmlForm(jsonData);\n\n            formElement.appendChild(this.createSubmitButton());\n\n            const { outputLabel, outputTextarea } = this.createOutputElements();\n            formElement.appendChild(outputLabel);\n            formElement.appendChild(outputTextarea);\n\n            this.document.body.appendChild(formElement);\n            this.document.head.appendChild(this.createClientScript());\n\n            return this.dom.serialize();\n        } catch (error) {\n            console.error('Error in jsonFileToHtmlForm:', error);\n            \n            if (error instanceof SyntaxError) {\n                throw new Error(`Invalid JSON in file ${filePath}: ${error.message}`);\n            } else if (error.code === 'ENOENT') {\n                throw new Error(`File not found: ${error.path}`);\n            } else {\n                throw new Error(`Failed to process form: ${error.message}`);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThese changes address the following:\n\n1. The error with setting the 'type' property on textarea elements is fixed by creating the correct input element type upfront and not trying to set the 'type' afterwards.\n\n2. We've added more specific error handling in the `jsonFileToHtmlForm` method. It now checks for a valid JSON structure and provides more informative error messages for different types of errors (JSON parsing errors, file not found, etc.).\n\n3. The `setInputAttributes` method now skips 'type' and 'subtype' properties, only setting custom data attributes.\n\nThese improvements should resolve the immediate error and make the code more robust against potential issues.\n\nQ1: How does this error handling improvement help in debugging and maintaining the application?\nQ2: What other types of input validation might be useful to add to this code?\nQ3: How could we make this code more flexible to handle different JSON structures or form layouts?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T13:37:30.855519Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T13:37:30.855519Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "5aa6d089-8c61-4ff7-b00a-be0d4f40a504", "name": "Automatically Rendering JSON and Markdown as RDF", "created_at": "2024-09-25T13:49:11.333405Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-25T13:49:18.564093Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "202e5232-f6de-497b-9ff5-2e83b04c4f53", "text": "I'm writing specifications which will use the same basic technique as GRDDL, Gleaning Resource Descriptions from Dialects of Languages, to automatically render JSON and markdown data as RDF.

Creating simplified, imperative-style runners for declarative systems\n7. Balancing between unit and integration tests\n\nThis approach combines elements of:\n\n1. Agile Development: Your focus on iterative development, adapting to AI limitations, and emphasis on testing aligns with Agile principles.\n\n2. Extreme Programming (XP): The increased focus on testing and creating small, independent components is reminiscent of XP practices.\n\n3. Test-Driven Development (TDD): Your approach to creating more tests with AI assistance reflects aspects of TDD.\n\n4. Modular Programming: The emphasis on small, independent components aligns with modular programming principles.\n\n5. AI-Augmented Development: Your use of AI tools throughout the development process is part of an emerging trend in software development.\n\n6. Continuous Integration (CI): The practice of frequently integrating code changes and running tests is implied in your workflow.\n\nWhile there isn't a specific name for this exact combination of practices, it could be described as \"AI-Assisted Agile Development with Emphasis on Modularity and Testing\" or perhaps \"AI-Augmented Modular TDD.\"\n\nThe use of simplified runners for declarative systems is an interesting approach that doesn't have a widely-used name, but it's conceptually similar to creating \"simulators\" or \"mock environments\" for complex systems. This practice allows for faster iteration and testing of components in isolation.\n\nIf you're looking to name this approach, you might consider something like \"Declarative-Imperative Hybrid Testing\" or \"Selective Context AI-Assisted Development\" to capture the essence of your methodology.\n\nIt's worth noting that as AI-assisted development evolves, we may see more formal methodologies emerge that incorporate these practices. Your approach seems to be at the forefront of adapting existing best practices to work effectively with AI assistance in software development.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-25T15:02:18.400861Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-25T15:02:18.400861Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "394c882a-c297-4b23-b795-cac81d62dd8e", "text": "in the following a software methodology is described. Has this specific approach already got a name, maybe around Agile or Extreme programming?\ntl;dr : for software projects, I'd strongly recommend repopack[^1]\nLate to this thread, I was actually trying to find out if Claude has a limit on the number of Projects you can create (anyone?). Tip I must share before moving on...\nI've found Claude Projects incredibly useful for not-huge (mostly coding) projects. I was using ChatGPT (and Cursor, and various free tools) but my funds are limited, and after a recent run around the block have settled on Claude Pro (and Codeium, and various free tools).\nThe Projects made a big difference to my productivity out of the box (well, after giving them custom system prompts), but I was still running into familiar issues around context length, also size of \"project knowledge\" attachments. A little breakthrough for me was discovering **repopack**. It's an open source nodejs-built utility which will crawl filesystem dirs and collate code into a single AI-friendly text file, stripping comments along the way if you like. The config is fairly basic, but it can do things like respect .gitignore, any similar custom additions etc.\nThe code I'm working on at the moment makes use of a few obscure libs that both OpenAI and Claude tended to hallucinate a lot over. But repopack allows me to add a couple of those of immediate interest. My main project at the moment as a whole (plus an essential lib) is over the limit. But I've been able to work around that by being selective, swapping out the \"project knowledge\" repopacks as I go along to focus on today's target.\nA curious side effect is that it's made me much more diligent with Best Practices - favouring small, independent components and creating (with the help of AI) lots more tests than I would working alone.\nClose to this is a **new methodology**  (to me at least - has it a name?), somewhere in between those ^^. My big project is a pipeliney thing which has open-ended use cases. The application functionality is defined declaratively (in RDF/Turtle), the pipeline only glued together at runtime (via a variant of dependency injection). But that gluing and runtime operation brings in a *lot* of (common) overhead. So I've begun making (with AI assistance) quick & dirty imperative-style runners for the specific applications. This gives me things that lie somewhere in between unit and (full) integration tests. It's been surprisingly useful. I'm confident the declarative bits are close to correct, so if the new single-purpose imperative runner works, there's a very good chance those components will work correctly flipped in the larger environment.   \nI would have been very unlikely to go down this route otherwise, but it means I can significantly cut down the codebase an AI assistant has to consider, get it capable of much more of the work.   \n[^1]: https://github.com/yamadashy/repopack", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-25T15:02:18.400861Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-25T15:02:18.400861Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "71fceb1e-f37b-4dd1-b958-a5a5f758e553", "name": "Extracting RDF Data from a Form", "created_at": "2024-09-25T19:56:01.124544Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-25T20:09:58.659787Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "7e2c2bb8-84cd-4da9-9899-8e9e826b1008", "text": " Certainly!

Integration into service execution:\n   ```javascript\n   class TransmissionService {\n     constructor(llm, promptUpdater, successLogger) {\n       this.llm = llm;\n       this.promptUpdater = promptUpdater;\n       this.successLogger = successLogger;\n     }\n\n     async execute(input) {\n       const updatedPrompt = await this.promptUpdater.updatePrompt(this.id, this.basePrompt, input);\n       const output = await this.llm.generate(updatedPrompt, input);\n       \n       const metrics = this.evaluateOutput(output);\n       if (this.isSuccessful(metrics)) {\n         await this.successLogger.logSuccess(this.id, input, output, metrics);\n       }\n\n       return output;\n     }\n\n     evaluateOutput(output) {\n       // Implement output evaluation logic\n     }\n\n     isSuccessful(metrics) {\n       // Define success criteria based on metrics\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\nThis system continuously improves by incorporating successful examples into future prompts.

This stems from our research on validating data quality in LLM pipelines and applications\u2014which is starting to be productionized in both vertical AI applications and LLMOps companies. (I am always very thankful to the teams in industry who find my work useful and are open to collaborating.)\n\nMy ideas for data flywheels are grounded in several observations:\n\nHumans need to be in the loop for evaluation regularly, as human preferences on LLM outputs change over time.\nFine-tuning models come with significant overhead, and many teams prefer LLM APIs for rapid iteration and simple deployment. LLM APIs do not always listen to instructions in the prompt, especially over large batches of inputs, and there thus needs to be validators on LLM outputs.\nLLM-as-a-judge is increasingly popular. LLMs are getting cheaper, better, and faster.\nEmpirical evidence shows that few-shot examples are most effective for improving prompt performance. As such, LLM-as-a-judge can be aligned with human preferences\u2014given the right few-shot examples.\nIn this post, I\u2019ll outline a three-part framework for approaching this problem. Before we dive into the details of each part, let\u2019s take a look at an overview of the entire LLM application pipeline:\n\nData Flywheels\n\nFigure 1: Continually-Evolving LLM Application Pipeline, adapted from the source of Figure 1 in this paper.\n\nThis diagram illustrates my (idealized) architecture of an LLM pipeline, from input processing through evaluation and logging. It showcases ideas I\u2019ll discuss throughout the blog post, such as input validation, dynamic few-shot example retrieval, and the use of both code-based and LLM-based metrics for evaluation.\n\nNow, let\u2019s break down this process into the main parts: Evaluation, Monitoring, and Continual Improvement.\n\nA Framework for Creating a Flywheel\n1. Evaluation: Defining Success Metrics\nThere are several great resources specifically on evaluation. Here\u2019s one I really like from my friend Hamel, with concrete examples of what metrics to evaluate and tools to use. I\u2019ll focus on a more high-level overview of the metric process: first, establish clear criteria for success, then, try to find the right implementations of these metrics. This process is more nuanced than it might initially appear:\n\na) Identify metrics that matter for your specific use case.\nFor a customer service chatbot, you might care about \u201cresponse conciseness\u201d or \u201cempathy scores.\u201d However, it\u2019s important to note that you can\u2019t determine effective criteria purely through theorizing about possible failure modes for your task. You need to examine actual data\u2014many LLM outputs\u2014to get a true sense of what criteria you want to validate for LLM outputs for your specific task.\n\nLooking at data to inform your evaluation metrics is necessary because some metrics correspond to LLM idiosyncrasies or even quirks specific to your task. For example, you might notice that words like \u201cdelve\u201d and \u201ccrucial\u201d commonly give off a \u201cGPT smell\u201d that you want to avoid. In this case, you might implement a metric that checks for the absence of such words. These kinds of insights only emerge from careful examination of real outputs.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified the right metrics for your use case, the next step is implementing them effectively:\n\nb) Implement these metrics.\nAs depicted in the \u201cBinary Metrics\u201d section of Figure 1, we can use both code-based metrics and LLM-based metrics (via prompts) for evaluation:\n\nSimple code functions to assess heuristics: For instance, character counting for conciseness.\n\u201dLLM-as-a-judge\u201d: Querying an LLM to evaluate a specific metric that you define. This approach is particularly useful for more subjective or complex criteria.\nWhen using LLM-as-a-judge, aligning the judge\u2019s outputs with your own judgment can be challenging, especially for custom or bespoke tasks. Providing some examples of what you think are good and bad LLM outputs (with respect to your metric) in the judge\u2019s prompt can significantly improve alignment.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that binary metrics (True/False) are much easier to align and reason about from a UX standpoint. Many people reflexively turn to Likert scales or more fine-grained metrics for LLM judges, but it\u2019s often better to start simple. Binary metrics are easier to align (you only need to agree on what constitutes True and False) and easier for humans to consistently judge, which is important for maintaining the quality of your evaluation data over time.\n\nc) Validating multi-step pipelines (i.e., \u201cgraphs\u201d of LLM calls).\nIn complex LLM applications with interconnected \u201cgraphs\u201d of LLM calls, we can think of validators as probes in software observability. Just as probes are strategically placed to monitor software behavior, validators should be placed in LLM graphs to assess the quality and correctness of intermediate and final outputs. For each type of node in an LLM graph, we want to probe its behavior differently. My friend Han proposed three node types that resonated with my experience. I found his categorization insightful and decided to expand upon it with my own observations from the field:\n\nLLM Graph Nodes\n\nFigure 2: LLM-based nodes in a customer support chatbot pipeline. Diamond nodes represent classifiers, hexagonal nodes represent codegen nodes, and the rectangular nodes represent LLM-as-writers. This diagram omits tool use (e.g., executing the generated SQL statement against a database; looking up keys in a knowledge base to find documents that might answer the user\u2019s query) for clarity.\n\nLLM as Classifiers (State Transition Nodes; Diamond Nodes in Figure 2):\nExample: In a more complex customer support chatbot, a state transition node could use an LLM to classify user intents (e.g., \u201cbilling issue,\u201d \u201ctechnical support,\u201d \u201cgeneral inquiry\u201d) and route the conversation to the appropriate subgraph based on the predicted intent.\nFocus on assessing the correctness of decision-making\u2014using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\nApply rule-based validation (e.g., if the user mentions \u201cbill\u201d or \u201cpayment,\u201d the expected intent should be \u201cbilling issue\u201d, and if the LLM\u2019s predicted intent does not match the expected intent, flag the conversation for human review and potentially update few-shot examples and training data).\nLLM as Writers (Generative Nodes; Rectangular Nodes in Figure 2):\nThese metrics will be the most bespoke, as they are highly user-specific and task-specific.\nE.g., assess quality, coherence, and appropriateness of generated content. Can also metrics like perplexity, diversity, and adherence to task-specific constraints\u2014depending on how actionable these are for the business.\nIn the customer support chatbot example, one could write an LLM-based validator to check adherence to the brand\u2019s tone and voice guidelines (based on examples of the company branding).\nLLM as Compilers/Code Generators (Codegen Nodes; Hexagonal Nodes in Figure 2):\nExample: In the customer support chatbot, an LLM-as-codegen node could generate SQL queries to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base based on the user\u2019s intent and context.\nUse static code analysis, linters, and test suites to validate generated code.\nEmploy dynamic analysis techniques when applicable, such as automatically executing generated SQL statements against a database in a text-to-SQL LLM pipeline and verifying the output.\nPotentially use an LLM-based validator to determine if the output reasonably answer\u2019s the user\u2019s query.\nWhen implementing validators at every node in the graph of LLM calls, you can easily end up with many validators, and it\u2019s not always clear which ones are most critical. By labeling validator outputs and computing per-step accuracy, you can trace how errors compound across the pipeline, providing valuable insights for targeted improvements. I think that comprehensive solutions for validating multi-step LLM pipelines are still an open research question, which I\u2019ll discuss further later.\n\nd) Validate inputs as well as outputs.\nInput validation, illustrated on the left side of Figure 1, ensures that only appropriate queries are processed by the LLM. While the majority of literature focuses on validating LLM outputs, validating input data is also important for building robust LLM applications. This ensures that your pipeline handles only inputs it was designed for, rejecting or flagging out-of-distribution inputs.\n\nWhile data validation is well-explored for traditional ML, adapting these techniques for bespoke LLM pipelines with free-text inputs often requires equally bespoke validation approaches, in addition to general validation (e.g., language detection).\n\nMy general philosophy here mirrors Brendan Dolan-Gavitt\u2019s, who says: \u201cthe best design principle seems to be Postel\u2019s Law: be strict in what you send to the LLM, and liberal in what you accept as a valid response.\u201d Let\u2019s consider a customer support chatbot example to illustrate some input validation metrics:\n\nUser Authentication:\nMetric: Query relates only to the authenticated customer\u2019s data\nImplementation: Compare entities mentioned in the query (e.g., order numbers, account details) against the customer\u2019s record in your database\nTopic Relevance:\nMetric: Query relates to predefined support topics\nImplementation: a) Keyword matching: Check for presence of key terms related to your support areas b) Semantic similarity: Calculate cosine similarity between query embedding and embeddings of your support document set, setting a minimum threshold (e.g., 0.7)\nQuery Complexity:\nMetric: Query length and structure fall within expected ranges\nImplementation: Set acceptable ranges for token count, sentence count, and presence of specific syntactic structures\nLanguage Detection:\nMetric: Query is in a supported language, like English\nImplementation: Use a language detection library to ensure the query is in one of your supported languages\nSensitive Information Detection:\nMetric: Query does not contain unexpected sensitive information\nImplementation: Use regex patterns or named entity recognition to flag potential presence of sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, social security numbers)\nAdversarial Input Detection:\nMetric: Query does not attempt to manipulate the system\nImplementation: Check for known adversarial patterns, such as repeated attempts to access other users\u2019 data or prompt injection attempts\nAnomaly Detection:\nMetric: Query is similar to recent queries\nImplementation: Compare the query\u2019s embedding to embeddings of recent queries. If the similarity falls below a threshold, flag it for human review\nOne can also use LLM-based validators to validate inputs\u2014which also raises the question of how to align the LLM with human judgment. I\u2019ll discuss this in the next subsection.\n\n2. Monitoring: Operationalizing Metric Implementations\nOnce you\u2019ve defined your metrics, the next challenge is ensuring they keep up with production data. This process should be as automated as possible, given the dynamic nature of LLM applications.\n\na) Automatically reassess if your chosen metrics still align with your goals.\nThe metric set that you come up with from the previous section is not meant to be static. When you deploy your application, you will learn of new failure modes, and you may want to update your metric set. Moreover, LLM APIs are constantly changing under the hood, and your ideal system behavior will evolve over time.\n\nOne idea to semi-automate the evolution of your metric set is to consider deploying an LLM \u201cagent\u201d that regularly analyzes a sample of labeled production data to determine if your metric set needs updating. This agent could:\n\nPropose new metrics (e.g., if customers consistently dislike certain phrasings)\nSuggest changes to metric definitions (e.g., realizing that conciseness is more subjective than a simple character count)\nRecommend removing metrics that don\u2019t correlate with key performance indicators like accuracy or click-through rates\nIn the prompt, the LLM agent only needs samples of the production data and the current metric set. While this LLM agent can automatically run regularly, it\u2019s probably important that an AI engineer actually verifies new metric sets before implementation.1\n\nWhile an LLM agent can help evolve your metric set over time, it\u2019s equally important to ensure that your metric implementations also evolve.\n\nb) Keep metric implementations aligned with your evaluation criteria.\nAlignment has to be continually reassessed as production data drifts over time. This is particularly important for LLM-based metric evaluators. A more detailed workflow might look like this:\n\nFor each metric, regularly sample and label a set of responses from production data.\nStore these labeled examples in a database, preferably with timestamps for recency tracking. I know of some people who also store embedding-based indexes of their labeled examples.\nFor code-based metric implementations, schedule periodic manual reviews to ensure the code still captures the essence of the metric given recent data.\nFor LLM-based evaluations, keep the validator prompt dynamic:\nRetrieve examples from your database that are relevant to the instance being validated. The dynamic few-shot examples, highlighted in Figure 1, are retrieved based on input similarity.\nConsider an active learning-inspired approach: prioritize retrieving examples where human labels differed from what an LLM would predict. This helps focus on edge cases and areas of potential misalignment. I know of 2 people who do this (TBD on how much lift it provides over uniformly randomly sampling examples.)\nWeight similarity scores by label recency. Recent production data should have a higher likelihood of being selected as few-shot demonstrations compared to older data. Take this specific recency-weighting idea with a grain of salt\u2013I don\u2019t know of anyone who is doing this right now, but it seems important. (Interestingly, I know of one person who retrieves the most recent few-shot examples without looking at semantic similarity\u2014mostly because there is low data volume, so semantic similarity may not help.)\nOne significant challenge in this process is ensuring regular human labeling of data for each metric. It\u2019s important but can be burdensome. LangChain is exploring an interesting approach to this: using an LLM to label data by default, with humans able to edit these labels as they choose. While this definitely alleviates the labeling burden, it\u2019s unclear how well the LLM labeler will align with human judgment over time\u2013especially if engineers or team members are lazy and don\u2019t want to verify labels. However, even if not perfect, this approach ensures a constant stream of recent, relevant examples for few-shot demonstrations2, which is valuable in and of itself.\n\n3. Continual Improvement: Closing the Loop\nWith robust evaluation and monitoring in place, the focus shifts to systematically improving your application. This process involves both (manual) human insight and automated techniques to enhance performance based on real-world usage. As illustrated by the \u201cLogs\u201d component in Figure 1, a prerequisite here is to maintain a comprehensive log of outputs and their associated metric scores; many LLMOps tools (e.g., LangSmith) can help with this.\n\na) Manually iterate on prompts or pipelines to enhance performance on your defined metrics.\nThe key here is leveraging the insights gained from your evaluation and monitoring processes. With well-defined metrics and continually evolving implementations, you can identify which production traces performed well and which didn\u2019t, and learn from mistakes to improve prompts or other application components.\n\nSome strategies to consider:\n\nRegularly review the distribution of metric scores across your production data. Look for patterns or clusters of low-performing instances.\nDo analytics on inputs or query data distribution to observe patterns and changes in user behavior.\nTry A/B testing different prompt structures or pipeline configurations to empirically determine which performs better on your metrics.\nb) Automatically improve the pipeline in response to metrics.\nWhile human analysis described above is valuable, automating parts of the improvement process might improve efficiency. Here\u2019s what I imagine could be a basic improvement strategy:\n\nRegularly review and \u201cfix\u201d low-scoring outputs. This can be done on a daily or weekly cadence, depending on your application\u2019s scale and resources. The \u201cfixing\u201d process involves:\nIdentifying what went wrong in the original output\nRewriting the output to be correct\nDocumenting the changes made and the reasoning behind them (for other team members to learn from)\nImplement an active learning-inspired approach for continuous improvement:\nKeep a database of production traces along with their metric scores and any human-provided fixes.\nFor traces with low scores, prioritize them for manual review and fixing.\nDuring LLM inference at application runtime, retrieve the most similar \u201cfixed\u201d traces to the current query and include these as few-shot demonstrations in the prompt.3\nYou can experiment with different retrieval strategies, such as:\nIncluding both the most similar trace (regardless of its score or whether it was fixed) and the most similar fixed trace\nWeighting the retrieval by recency to favor more recent examples\nIncorporating a diversity measure to ensure a range of example types in your few-shot demonstrations\nIt\u2019s worth noting that decomposing \u201cgood\u201d outputs into multiple dimensions, rather than just having humans label traces holistically, offers several key benefits:\n\nBreaking down quality into specific metrics enables more accurate and consistent human labeling. Instead of making a single, high-level judgment, raters can focus on well-defined aspects like conciseness or politeness. This granularity promotes alignment and reduces subjectivity.\nAligning LLM validators becomes easier when they only need to check a single metric at a time. Trying to capture the full notion of \u201cgoodness\u201d in one fell swoop is challenging, but validating individual dimensions is more tractable.\nHaving scores for each metric provides a more nuanced view of performance. If most outputs are failing due to a specific metric, it pinpoints the area needing improvement.\nSo while involving human labeling regardless, using multiple metrics brings rigor, consistency, and actionable insights to the continual improvement process. It allows for a more systematic and effective approach to refining LLM applications over time.\n\nLLM Applications: A New Set of Challenges\nThe framework I\u2019ve outlined provides a solid foundation for building self-improving LLM applications. However, as we push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with these systems, new challenges emerge. Here are a couple of problems I\u2019ve been thinking about in the LLMOps lifecycle, more from a research perspective:\n\nApplications of LLM Uncertainty Quantification to Aligning Validators\nOne key challenge is uncertainty quantification for LLM APIs, especially when dealing with custom tasks. Active learning, a powerful tool for improving ML models, becomes challenging with LLM APIs, where we lack meaningful probability estimates. Next-token probabilities from instruction-tuned models are uncalibrated and unhelpful when analyzing outputs at scale. Some ML research papers explore asking LLMs to simply output confidence scores after their outputs, but this doesn\u2019t work all that well either. Of course, a straightforward solution is to fine-tune LLMs instead of using LLM APIs, but this ignores the premise\u2014the simplicity of LLM APIs.\n\nRobust uncertainty estimates could significantly enhance our ability to align metric implementations, sample informative few-shot examples, and prioritize data for human labeling. While this is an open research question, advances in this area could directly strengthen the Evaluation and Continual Improvement components of our framework.\n\nData Flywheels for \u201cGraphs\u201d of LLM Calls\nAs LLM applications grow in complexity, we often deal with interconnected networks or \u201cgraphs\u201d of LLM calls, representing multi-step reasoning processes. Some applications even put LLMs in loops! Implementing data flywheels for such systems presents unique challenges:\n\nErrors from one node can amplify through subsequent nodes, necessitating early detection and correction.\nWe need to assess the quality of both intermediate and final outputs. This can be a lot for a human to manually grade.\nGraphs are dynamic: LLM-based graphs might change structure based on inputs or intermediate results, complicating evaluation and improvement processes.\nTo address these challenges, key research directions include:\n\na) What does it mean to implement graph-aware evaluation metrics? Do we employ some form of hierarchical validation\u2014where we validate individual LLM calls or nodes, walks or subgraphs, and then entire graphs? These validation probes should probably be different for different types of nodes, but what are the types and how should validation differ?\n\nb) How can we design systems that dynamically insert validation probes at critical junctures in the graph? This approach could involve developing algorithms that identify high-risk nodes or transitions based on historical performance data or uncertainty measurements\u2014or causal analysis techniques. Ideally, we can catch and correct errors early, before they propagate through the system.\n\nc) Can we extend the concept of dynamic few-shot learning to graph structures? This might involve developing techniques to retrieve relevant subgraph traces based on the current graph configuration and task. We could explore using graph-aware embeddings or subgraph matching algorithms to find similar patterns in historical data.\n\nDatabase-Driven LLM Pipeline Validation\nI am curious about integrating validators directly into database systems. Currently, it\u2019s a lot of work for application developers to implement logging and validation of all traces. It\u2019s challenging to implement few-shot retrieval, ensure all validators (especially LLM-powered validators) complete successfully, write the results to the DB, etc., in real-time or even in the application background\u2014especially given that this can require significant computational resources or take a long time to run. Ideally, the database can do this for us.\n\nKey questions I\u2019ve been thinking about include:\n\na) Implementing validators as database triggers or stored procedures: This allows for automatic execution of both code-based and LLM-based validators whenever new data is inserted or updated. How can we design these triggers to be efficient and not significantly impact database performance?\n\nb) Using database views for flexible metric computation: By implementing metrics as views rather than computing all metrics (which could be costly, especially if LLMs are evaluating metrics), we can potentially save resources. What are the trade-offs between on-demand computation and materialized views for different types of metrics?\n\nc) Incremental maintenance of semantic indexes of logs: For efficient retrieval of few-shot examples, we need to maintain up-to-date semantic similarity indexes for LLM pipeline traces. Are there simple incremental update strategies to keep these indexes current without full rebuilds?\n\nWrapping Up\nBuilding self-improving LLM applications is about applying a systematic approach, focusing on what truly matters for your use case, and iterating based on real-world performance. The framework I outlined is intentionally simple: it doesn\u2019t rely on sophisticated tools, ML platforms, or enterprise-grade monitoring systems. Instead, it emphasizes thoughtful metric selection, consistent monitoring, and data-driven improvements.\n\nAt the end of the day, people (myself included) won\u2019t be happy until all production data is maximally leveraged for future pipeline runs\u2014and this hopefully-simple approach makes a big leap in turning every production trace into an opportunity for refinement and enhancement. Of course, there is still work and research to do\u2014e.g., LLM-as-a-judge is not perfect, and LLM applications can be pretty complex, possibly requiring different validation techniques.\n\nZooming out a bit\u2014I think it is such an exciting time to be building intelligent software applications. Self-improving applications are actually possible to build right now, and there are still many questions to answer. But I am most excited because the path forward will be collaborative and interdisciplinary\u2014uniting industry practitioners, researchers, and experts across various fields and subareas of computer science\u2014as we chart the future of engineering intelligent software.\n\nThanks to my friend Han Lee for his valuable feedback and insights on an earlier draft of this post. I also thank my advisor Aditya Parameswaran for suggesting the idea of a detailed blog post on our recent LLMOps research, and my colleague Parth Asawa for inspiring the narrative around the data flywheel concept.\n\nIf you are interested in collaborating on any of these research projects, please feel free to reach out to me at shreyashankar@berkeley.edu. Include your CV and specify the project you are interested in, along with any initial thoughts or ideas you might have.\n\nFootnotes\nWhile I have not seen any agent that does exactly what I have outlined above, Alta, a startup that I work with, employs an agent to automatically suggest changes to metric definitions. I think Alta\u2019s approach is awesome and allows them to be ultra-personalized (i.e., have a different metric set per end-user), and I am excited to see how it evolves over time. \u21a9\n\nHan raised a good point here while reviewing the blog post: this approach might not be kosher for some industries, e.g., what if the legal team wants to \u201csign off\u201d on prompts before they go into production?

This stems from our research on validating data quality in LLM pipelines and applications\u2014which is starting to be productionized in both vertical AI applications and LLMOps companies. (I am always very thankful to the teams in industry who find my work useful and are open to collaborating.)\n\nMy ideas for data flywheels are grounded in several observations:\n\nHumans need to be in the loop for evaluation regularly, as human preferences on LLM outputs change over time.\nFine-tuning models come with significant overhead, and many teams prefer LLM APIs for rapid iteration and simple deployment. LLM APIs do not always listen to instructions in the prompt, especially over large batches of inputs, and there thus needs to be validators on LLM outputs.\nLLM-as-a-judge is increasingly popular. LLMs are getting cheaper, better, and faster.\nEmpirical evidence shows that few-shot examples are most effective for improving prompt performance. As such, LLM-as-a-judge can be aligned with human preferences\u2014given the right few-shot examples.\nIn this post, I\u2019ll outline a three-part framework for approaching this problem. Before we dive into the details of each part, let\u2019s take a look at an overview of the entire LLM application pipeline:\n\nData Flywheels\n\nFigure 1: Continually-Evolving LLM Application Pipeline, adapted from the source of Figure 1 in this paper.\n\nThis diagram illustrates my (idealized) architecture of an LLM pipeline, from input processing through evaluation and logging. It showcases ideas I\u2019ll discuss throughout the blog post, such as input validation, dynamic few-shot example retrieval, and the use of both code-based and LLM-based metrics for evaluation.\n\nNow, let\u2019s break down this process into the main parts: Evaluation, Monitoring, and Continual Improvement.\n\nA Framework for Creating a Flywheel\n1. Evaluation: Defining Success Metrics\nThere are several great resources specifically on evaluation. Here\u2019s one I really like from my friend Hamel, with concrete examples of what metrics to evaluate and tools to use. I\u2019ll focus on a more high-level overview of the metric process: first, establish clear criteria for success, then, try to find the right implementations of these metrics. This process is more nuanced than it might initially appear:\n\na) Identify metrics that matter for your specific use case.\nFor a customer service chatbot, you might care about \u201cresponse conciseness\u201d or \u201cempathy scores.\u201d However, it\u2019s important to note that you can\u2019t determine effective criteria purely through theorizing about possible failure modes for your task. You need to examine actual data\u2014many LLM outputs\u2014to get a true sense of what criteria you want to validate for LLM outputs for your specific task.\n\nLooking at data to inform your evaluation metrics is necessary because some metrics correspond to LLM idiosyncrasies or even quirks specific to your task. For example, you might notice that words like \u201cdelve\u201d and \u201ccrucial\u201d commonly give off a \u201cGPT smell\u201d that you want to avoid. In this case, you might implement a metric that checks for the absence of such words. These kinds of insights only emerge from careful examination of real outputs.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve identified the right metrics for your use case, the next step is implementing them effectively:\n\nb) Implement these metrics.\nAs depicted in the \u201cBinary Metrics\u201d section of Figure 1, we can use both code-based metrics and LLM-based metrics (via prompts) for evaluation:\n\nSimple code functions to assess heuristics: For instance, character counting for conciseness.\n\u201dLLM-as-a-judge\u201d: Querying an LLM to evaluate a specific metric that you define. This approach is particularly useful for more subjective or complex criteria.\nWhen using LLM-as-a-judge, aligning the judge\u2019s outputs with your own judgment can be challenging, especially for custom or bespoke tasks. Providing some examples of what you think are good and bad LLM outputs (with respect to your metric) in the judge\u2019s prompt can significantly improve alignment.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that binary metrics (True/False) are much easier to align and reason about from a UX standpoint. Many people reflexively turn to Likert scales or more fine-grained metrics for LLM judges, but it\u2019s often better to start simple. Binary metrics are easier to align (you only need to agree on what constitutes True and False) and easier for humans to consistently judge, which is important for maintaining the quality of your evaluation data over time.\n\nc) Validating multi-step pipelines (i.e., \u201cgraphs\u201d of LLM calls).\nIn complex LLM applications with interconnected \u201cgraphs\u201d of LLM calls, we can think of validators as probes in software observability. Just as probes are strategically placed to monitor software behavior, validators should be placed in LLM graphs to assess the quality and correctness of intermediate and final outputs. For each type of node in an LLM graph, we want to probe its behavior differently. My friend Han proposed three node types that resonated with my experience. I found his categorization insightful and decided to expand upon it with my own observations from the field:\n\nLLM Graph Nodes\n\nFigure 2: LLM-based nodes in a customer support chatbot pipeline. Diamond nodes represent classifiers, hexagonal nodes represent codegen nodes, and the rectangular nodes represent LLM-as-writers. This diagram omits tool use (e.g., executing the generated SQL statement against a database; looking up keys in a knowledge base to find documents that might answer the user\u2019s query) for clarity.\n\nLLM as Classifiers (State Transition Nodes; Diamond Nodes in Figure 2):\nExample: In a more complex customer support chatbot, a state transition node could use an LLM to classify user intents (e.g., \u201cbilling issue,\u201d \u201ctechnical support,\u201d \u201cgeneral inquiry\u201d) and route the conversation to the appropriate subgraph based on the predicted intent.\nFocus on assessing the correctness of decision-making\u2014using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\nApply rule-based validation (e.g., if the user mentions \u201cbill\u201d or \u201cpayment,\u201d the expected intent should be \u201cbilling issue\u201d, and if the LLM\u2019s predicted intent does not match the expected intent, flag the conversation for human review and potentially update few-shot examples and training data).\nLLM as Writers (Generative Nodes; Rectangular Nodes in Figure 2):\nThese metrics will be the most bespoke, as they are highly user-specific and task-specific.\nE.g., assess quality, coherence, and appropriateness of generated content. Can also metrics like perplexity, diversity, and adherence to task-specific constraints\u2014depending on how actionable these are for the business.\nIn the customer support chatbot example, one could write an LLM-based validator to check adherence to the brand\u2019s tone and voice guidelines (based on examples of the company branding).\nLLM as Compilers/Code Generators (Codegen Nodes; Hexagonal Nodes in Figure 2):\nExample: In the customer support chatbot, an LLM-as-codegen node could generate SQL queries to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base based on the user\u2019s intent and context.\nUse static code analysis, linters, and test suites to validate generated code.\nEmploy dynamic analysis techniques when applicable, such as automatically executing generated SQL statements against a database in a text-to-SQL LLM pipeline and verifying the output.\nPotentially use an LLM-based validator to determine if the output reasonably answer\u2019s the user\u2019s query.\nWhen implementing validators at every node in the graph of LLM calls, you can easily end up with many validators, and it\u2019s not always clear which ones are most critical. By labeling validator outputs and computing per-step accuracy, you can trace how errors compound across the pipeline, providing valuable insights for targeted improvements. I think that comprehensive solutions for validating multi-step LLM pipelines are still an open research question, which I\u2019ll discuss further later.\n\nd) Validate inputs as well as outputs.\nInput validation, illustrated on the left side of Figure 1, ensures that only appropriate queries are processed by the LLM. While the majority of literature focuses on validating LLM outputs, validating input data is also important for building robust LLM applications. This ensures that your pipeline handles only inputs it was designed for, rejecting or flagging out-of-distribution inputs.\n\nWhile data validation is well-explored for traditional ML, adapting these techniques for bespoke LLM pipelines with free-text inputs often requires equally bespoke validation approaches, in addition to general validation (e.g., language detection).\n\nMy general philosophy here mirrors Brendan Dolan-Gavitt\u2019s, who says: \u201cthe best design principle seems to be Postel\u2019s Law: be strict in what you send to the LLM, and liberal in what you accept as a valid response.\u201d Let\u2019s consider a customer support chatbot example to illustrate some input validation metrics:\n\nUser Authentication:\nMetric: Query relates only to the authenticated customer\u2019s data\nImplementation: Compare entities mentioned in the query (e.g., order numbers, account details) against the customer\u2019s record in your database\nTopic Relevance:\nMetric: Query relates to predefined support topics\nImplementation: a) Keyword matching: Check for presence of key terms related to your support areas b) Semantic similarity: Calculate cosine similarity between query embedding and embeddings of your support document set, setting a minimum threshold (e.g., 0.7)\nQuery Complexity:\nMetric: Query length and structure fall within expected ranges\nImplementation: Set acceptable ranges for token count, sentence count, and presence of specific syntactic structures\nLanguage Detection:\nMetric: Query is in a supported language, like English\nImplementation: Use a language detection library to ensure the query is in one of your supported languages\nSensitive Information Detection:\nMetric: Query does not contain unexpected sensitive information\nImplementation: Use regex patterns or named entity recognition to flag potential presence of sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, social security numbers)\nAdversarial Input Detection:\nMetric: Query does not attempt to manipulate the system\nImplementation: Check for known adversarial patterns, such as repeated attempts to access other users\u2019 data or prompt injection attempts\nAnomaly Detection:\nMetric: Query is similar to recent queries\nImplementation: Compare the query\u2019s embedding to embeddings of recent queries. If the similarity falls below a threshold, flag it for human review\nOne can also use LLM-based validators to validate inputs\u2014which also raises the question of how to align the LLM with human judgment. I\u2019ll discuss this in the next subsection.\n\n2. Monitoring: Operationalizing Metric Implementations\nOnce you\u2019ve defined your metrics, the next challenge is ensuring they keep up with production data. This process should be as automated as possible, given the dynamic nature of LLM applications.\n\na) Automatically reassess if your chosen metrics still align with your goals.\nThe metric set that you come up with from the previous section is not meant to be static. When you deploy your application, you will learn of new failure modes, and you may want to update your metric set. Moreover, LLM APIs are constantly changing under the hood, and your ideal system behavior will evolve over time.\n\nOne idea to semi-automate the evolution of your metric set is to consider deploying an LLM \u201cagent\u201d that regularly analyzes a sample of labeled production data to determine if your metric set needs updating. This agent could:\n\nPropose new metrics (e.g., if customers consistently dislike certain phrasings)\nSuggest changes to metric definitions (e.g., realizing that conciseness is more subjective than a simple character count)\nRecommend removing metrics that don\u2019t correlate with key performance indicators like accuracy or click-through rates\nIn the prompt, the LLM agent only needs samples of the production data and the current metric set. While this LLM agent can automatically run regularly, it\u2019s probably important that an AI engineer actually verifies new metric sets before implementation.1\n\nWhile an LLM agent can help evolve your metric set over time, it\u2019s equally important to ensure that your metric implementations also evolve.\n\nb) Keep metric implementations aligned with your evaluation criteria.\nAlignment has to be continually reassessed as production data drifts over time. This is particularly important for LLM-based metric evaluators. A more detailed workflow might look like this:\n\nFor each metric, regularly sample and label a set of responses from production data.\nStore these labeled examples in a database, preferably with timestamps for recency tracking. I know of some people who also store embedding-based indexes of their labeled examples.\nFor code-based metric implementations, schedule periodic manual reviews to ensure the code still captures the essence of the metric given recent data.\nFor LLM-based evaluations, keep the validator prompt dynamic:\nRetrieve examples from your database that are relevant to the instance being validated. The dynamic few-shot examples, highlighted in Figure 1, are retrieved based on input similarity.\nConsider an active learning-inspired approach: prioritize retrieving examples where human labels differed from what an LLM would predict. This helps focus on edge cases and areas of potential misalignment. I know of 2 people who do this (TBD on how much lift it provides over uniformly randomly sampling examples.)\nWeight similarity scores by label recency. Recent production data should have a higher likelihood of being selected as few-shot demonstrations compared to older data. Take this specific recency-weighting idea with a grain of salt\u2013I don\u2019t know of anyone who is doing this right now, but it seems important. (Interestingly, I know of one person who retrieves the most recent few-shot examples without looking at semantic similarity\u2014mostly because there is low data volume, so semantic similarity may not help.)\nOne significant challenge in this process is ensuring regular human labeling of data for each metric. It\u2019s important but can be burdensome. LangChain is exploring an interesting approach to this: using an LLM to label data by default, with humans able to edit these labels as they choose. While this definitely alleviates the labeling burden, it\u2019s unclear how well the LLM labeler will align with human judgment over time\u2013especially if engineers or team members are lazy and don\u2019t want to verify labels. However, even if not perfect, this approach ensures a constant stream of recent, relevant examples for few-shot demonstrations2, which is valuable in and of itself.\n\n3. Continual Improvement: Closing the Loop\nWith robust evaluation and monitoring in place, the focus shifts to systematically improving your application. This process involves both (manual) human insight and automated techniques to enhance performance based on real-world usage. As illustrated by the \u201cLogs\u201d component in Figure 1, a prerequisite here is to maintain a comprehensive log of outputs and their associated metric scores; many LLMOps tools (e.g., LangSmith) can help with this.\n\na) Manually iterate on prompts or pipelines to enhance performance on your defined metrics.\nThe key here is leveraging the insights gained from your evaluation and monitoring processes. With well-defined metrics and continually evolving implementations, you can identify which production traces performed well and which didn\u2019t, and learn from mistakes to improve prompts or other application components.\n\nSome strategies to consider:\n\nRegularly review the distribution of metric scores across your production data. Look for patterns or clusters of low-performing instances.\nDo analytics on inputs or query data distribution to observe patterns and changes in user behavior.\nTry A/B testing different prompt structures or pipeline configurations to empirically determine which performs better on your metrics.\nb) Automatically improve the pipeline in response to metrics.\nWhile human analysis described above is valuable, automating parts of the improvement process might improve efficiency. Here\u2019s what I imagine could be a basic improvement strategy:\n\nRegularly review and \u201cfix\u201d low-scoring outputs. This can be done on a daily or weekly cadence, depending on your application\u2019s scale and resources. The \u201cfixing\u201d process involves:\nIdentifying what went wrong in the original output\nRewriting the output to be correct\nDocumenting the changes made and the reasoning behind them (for other team members to learn from)\nImplement an active learning-inspired approach for continuous improvement:\nKeep a database of production traces along with their metric scores and any human-provided fixes.\nFor traces with low scores, prioritize them for manual review and fixing.\nDuring LLM inference at application runtime, retrieve the most similar \u201cfixed\u201d traces to the current query and include these as few-shot demonstrations in the prompt.3\nYou can experiment with different retrieval strategies, such as:\nIncluding both the most similar trace (regardless of its score or whether it was fixed) and the most similar fixed trace\nWeighting the retrieval by recency to favor more recent examples\nIncorporating a diversity measure to ensure a range of example types in your few-shot demonstrations\nIt\u2019s worth noting that decomposing \u201cgood\u201d outputs into multiple dimensions, rather than just having humans label traces holistically, offers several key benefits:\n\nBreaking down quality into specific metrics enables more accurate and consistent human labeling. Instead of making a single, high-level judgment, raters can focus on well-defined aspects like conciseness or politeness. This granularity promotes alignment and reduces subjectivity.\nAligning LLM validators becomes easier when they only need to check a single metric at a time. Trying to capture the full notion of \u201cgoodness\u201d in one fell swoop is challenging, but validating individual dimensions is more tractable.\nHaving scores for each metric provides a more nuanced view of performance. If most outputs are failing due to a specific metric, it pinpoints the area needing improvement.\nSo while involving human labeling regardless, using multiple metrics brings rigor, consistency, and actionable insights to the continual improvement process. It allows for a more systematic and effective approach to refining LLM applications over time.\n\nLLM Applications: A New Set of Challenges\nThe framework I\u2019ve outlined provides a solid foundation for building self-improving LLM applications. However, as we push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with these systems, new challenges emerge. Here are a couple of problems I\u2019ve been thinking about in the LLMOps lifecycle, more from a research perspective:\n\nApplications of LLM Uncertainty Quantification to Aligning Validators\nOne key challenge is uncertainty quantification for LLM APIs, especially when dealing with custom tasks. Active learning, a powerful tool for improving ML models, becomes challenging with LLM APIs, where we lack meaningful probability estimates. Next-token probabilities from instruction-tuned models are uncalibrated and unhelpful when analyzing outputs at scale. Some ML research papers explore asking LLMs to simply output confidence scores after their outputs, but this doesn\u2019t work all that well either. Of course, a straightforward solution is to fine-tune LLMs instead of using LLM APIs, but this ignores the premise\u2014the simplicity of LLM APIs.\n\nRobust uncertainty estimates could significantly enhance our ability to align metric implementations, sample informative few-shot examples, and prioritize data for human labeling. While this is an open research question, advances in this area could directly strengthen the Evaluation and Continual Improvement components of our framework.\n\nData Flywheels for \u201cGraphs\u201d of LLM Calls\nAs LLM applications grow in complexity, we often deal with interconnected networks or \u201cgraphs\u201d of LLM calls, representing multi-step reasoning processes. Some applications even put LLMs in loops! Implementing data flywheels for such systems presents unique challenges:\n\nErrors from one node can amplify through subsequent nodes, necessitating early detection and correction.\nWe need to assess the quality of both intermediate and final outputs. This can be a lot for a human to manually grade.\nGraphs are dynamic: LLM-based graphs might change structure based on inputs or intermediate results, complicating evaluation and improvement processes.\nTo address these challenges, key research directions include:\n\na) What does it mean to implement graph-aware evaluation metrics? Do we employ some form of hierarchical validation\u2014where we validate individual LLM calls or nodes, walks or subgraphs, and then entire graphs? These validation probes should probably be different for different types of nodes, but what are the types and how should validation differ?\n\nb) How can we design systems that dynamically insert validation probes at critical junctures in the graph? This approach could involve developing algorithms that identify high-risk nodes or transitions based on historical performance data or uncertainty measurements\u2014or causal analysis techniques. Ideally, we can catch and correct errors early, before they propagate through the system.\n\nc) Can we extend the concept of dynamic few-shot learning to graph structures? This might involve developing techniques to retrieve relevant subgraph traces based on the current graph configuration and task. We could explore using graph-aware embeddings or subgraph matching algorithms to find similar patterns in historical data.\n\nDatabase-Driven LLM Pipeline Validation\nI am curious about integrating validators directly into database systems. Currently, it\u2019s a lot of work for application developers to implement logging and validation of all traces. It\u2019s challenging to implement few-shot retrieval, ensure all validators (especially LLM-powered validators) complete successfully, write the results to the DB, etc., in real-time or even in the application background\u2014especially given that this can require significant computational resources or take a long time to run. Ideally, the database can do this for us.\n\nKey questions I\u2019ve been thinking about include:\n\na) Implementing validators as database triggers or stored procedures: This allows for automatic execution of both code-based and LLM-based validators whenever new data is inserted or updated. How can we design these triggers to be efficient and not significantly impact database performance?\n\nb) Using database views for flexible metric computation: By implementing metrics as views rather than computing all metrics (which could be costly, especially if LLMs are evaluating metrics), we can potentially save resources. What are the trade-offs between on-demand computation and materialized views for different types of metrics?\n\nc) Incremental maintenance of semantic indexes of logs: For efficient retrieval of few-shot examples, we need to maintain up-to-date semantic similarity indexes for LLM pipeline traces. Are there simple incremental update strategies to keep these indexes current without full rebuilds?\n\nWrapping Up\nBuilding self-improving LLM applications is about applying a systematic approach, focusing on what truly matters for your use case, and iterating based on real-world performance. The framework I outlined is intentionally simple: it doesn\u2019t rely on sophisticated tools, ML platforms, or enterprise-grade monitoring systems. Instead, it emphasizes thoughtful metric selection, consistent monitoring, and data-driven improvements.\n\nAt the end of the day, people (myself included) won\u2019t be happy until all production data is maximally leveraged for future pipeline runs\u2014and this hopefully-simple approach makes a big leap in turning every production trace into an opportunity for refinement and enhancement. Of course, there is still work and research to do\u2014e.g., LLM-as-a-judge is not perfect, and LLM applications can be pretty complex, possibly requiring different validation techniques.\n\nZooming out a bit\u2014I think it is such an exciting time to be building intelligent software applications. Self-improving applications are actually possible to build right now, and there are still many questions to answer. But I am most excited because the path forward will be collaborative and interdisciplinary\u2014uniting industry practitioners, researchers, and experts across various fields and subareas of computer science\u2014as we chart the future of engineering intelligent software.\n\nThanks to my friend Han Lee for his valuable feedback and insights on an earlier draft of this post. I also thank my advisor Aditya Parameswaran for suggesting the idea of a detailed blog post on our recent LLMOps research, and my colleague Parth Asawa for inspiring the narrative around the data flywheel concept.\n\nIf you are interested in collaborating on any of these research projects, please feel free to reach out to me at shreyashankar@berkeley.edu. Include your CV and specify the project you are interested in, along with any initial thoughts or ideas you might have.\n\nFootnotes\nWhile I have not seen any agent that does exactly what I have outlined above, Alta, a startup that I work with, employs an agent to automatically suggest changes to metric definitions. I think Alta\u2019s approach is awesome and allows them to be ultra-personalized (i.e., have a different metric set per end-user), and I am excited to see how it evolves over time. \u21a9\n\nHan raised a good point here while reviewing the blog post: this approach might not be kosher for some industries, e.g., what if the legal team wants to \u201csign off\u201d on prompts before they go into production? Or, what\u2019s the risk of prompt poisoning here\u2014can someone adversarially write queries that get included in the prompt as few-shot examples? \u21a9\n\nI really like this blog post (authored by my former colleague Devin Stein), which champions dynamically fetching examples for the prompt at runtime.

Namespace Definition\n\nFirst, define the namespace for Sowa's ontology:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix sowa: <http://example.org/sowa-ontology#> .\n@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .\n@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .\n@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .\n```\n\n## 2. Main Categories\n\nDefine the three main categories as OWL classes:\n\n```turtle\nsowa:Independent a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Independent\"@en .\n\nsowa:Relative a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Relative\"@en .\n\nsowa:Mediating a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Mediating\"@en .\n```\n\n## 3.

Lattice Structure\n\nTo represent the lattice structure and multiple inheritance, use OWL's `rdfs:subClassOf` property:\n\n```turtle\nsowa:Object a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Object\"@en ;\n    rdfs:subClassOf sowa:Independent, sowa:Physical .\n\nsowa:Schema a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Schema\"@en ;\n    rdfs:subClassOf sowa:Form, sowa:Abstract .\n\nsowa:Process a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Process\"@en ;\n    rdfs:subClassOf sowa:Mediating, sowa:Physical .\n\nsowa:Relation a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:label \"Relation\"@en ;\n    rdfs:subClassOf sowa:Relative, sowa:Abstract .\n```\n\n## 5.

Annotations\n\nAdd annotations to provide additional information:\n\n```turtle\nsowa:Ontology a owl:Ontology ;\n    rdfs:label \"Sowa's Upper Ontology\"@en ;\n    rdfs:comment \"An OWL representation of John Sowa's upper ontology\"@en ;\n    owl:versionInfo \"1.0\"^^xsd:string .\n```\n</antArtifact>\n\nI've created an artifact that outlines a possible approach to mapping Sowa's ontology to RDF and OWL2.

Ontology Imports\n\nThe most direct way to include another ontology is through imports:\n\n```turtle\n@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .\n@prefix : <http://example.org/myontology#> .\n\n<http://example.org/myontology>\n    a owl:Ontology ;\n    owl:imports <http://example.org/anotherontology> .\n```\n\nThis brings all the axioms from the imported ontology into the importing ontology.\n\n## 2. Punning\n\nOWL2 allows for \"punning\", where the same IRI can be used for different entity types:\n\n```turtle\n:Person a owl:Class .\n:Person a owl:NamedIndividual .\n```\n\nThis can be useful when integrating ontologies that use the same term differently.\n\n## 3. Ontology Versioning\n\nOWL2 supports versioning, allowing for the evolution of ontologies:\n\n```turtle\n<http://example.org/myontology>\n    a owl:Ontology ;\n    owl:versionIRI <http://example.org/myontology/2.0> .\n```\n\n## 4. Ontology Annotations\n\nAnnotations can be used to provide metadata about the ontology and its relationships:\n\n```turtle\n<http://example.org/myontology>\n    a owl:Ontology ;\n    rdfs:comment \"This ontology extends the XYZ ontology\"@en .\n```\n\n## 5. Modularization\n\nOWL2 allows for creating modular ontologies that can be combined:\n\n```turtle\n:ModuleA a owl:Ontology .\n:ModuleB a owl:Ontology .\n\n:CombinedOntology\n    a owl:Ontology ;\n    owl:imports :ModuleA, :ModuleB .\n```\n\n## 6. Ontology Mapping\n\nWhile not a built-in OWL2 feature, ontology mapping can be achieved using equivalence and subsumption axioms:\n\n```turtle\n:PersonA owl:equivalentClass :PersonB .\n:EmployeeA rdfs:subClassOf :WorkerB .\n```\n\n## 7. Profile Specification\n\nOWL2 profiles (EL, QL, RL) allow for different levels of expressivity and computational complexity:\n\n```turtle\n<http://example.org/myontology>\n    a owl:Ontology ;\n    rdf:type <http://www.w3.org/ns/owl-profile/EL> .\n```\n\nThese mechanisms provide flexibility in how ontologies can be combined, extended, and reused in OWL2.\n</antArtifact>\n\nI've created an artifact that outlines the main mechanisms in OWL2 for including and unifying ontologies. Here's a summary of the key points:\n\n1. Ontology Imports: Directly include another ontology using `owl:imports`.\n2. Punning: Use the same IRI for different entity types, useful for integrating ontologies.\n3. Ontology Versioning: Support for evolving ontologies over time.\n4. Ontology Annotations: Provide metadata about the ontology and its relationships.\n5. Modularization: Create and combine modular ontologies.\n6. Ontology Mapping: Use equivalence and subsumption axioms to map between ontologies.\n7. Profile Specification: Choose different OWL2 profiles for varying levels of expressivity.\n\nThese mechanisms allow for flexible and powerful ways to include, combine, and relate different ontologies within the OWL2 framework. This is particularly useful when working with upper ontologies like Sowa's, as it allows you to:\n\n1. Import the upper ontology into more specific domain ontologies.\n2. Create mappings between different upper ontologies.\n3. Extend or specialize parts of the upper ontology for specific domains.\n4. Version and evolve the ontology over time.\n\nWhen working with upper ontologies like Sowa's, you might use a combination of these mechanisms. For example, you could import Sowa's ontology into your domain-specific ontology, use punning to resolve any naming conflicts, and then use ontology mapping to relate your concepts to Sowa's upper-level categories.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on how any of these mechanisms might be specifically applied to working with Sowa's ontology or other upper ontologies?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-26T16:49:39.261916Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-26T16:49:39.261916Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "1596668e-3b70-47ba-9796-191ad1fa8cfe", "text": "Please give a a short description about how the ontologies listed are used in practice - mention how much used and how well maintained they are", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-26T16:52:43.925599Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-26T16:52:43.925599Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "274ca6d6-8ac2-42eb-ba6d-36e2daed9de7", "text": " Certainly.

Here are some key observations:\n\n1. BFO stands out as one of the most widely adopted and well-maintained upper ontologies, particularly in the biomedical domain. Its recognition as an ISO standard has further solidified its position.\n\n2. DOLCE and SUMO have moderate adoption, especially in academic and research settings. They continue to be maintained, though updates may be less frequent than BFO.\n\n3. Cyc, while comprehensive, has limited adoption due to its complexity and licensing model. However, it remains actively maintained by Cycorp.\n\n4. GFO and UFO have found niches in specific domains like biology, medicine, and conceptual modeling. They are actively maintained by their respective research groups.\n\n5. UMBEL appears to be inactive, with no recent updates. Its role in web content interoperability has largely been taken over by other initiatives like schema.org.\n\n6. Sowa's Upper Ontology, while influential in theoretical discussions, has limited practical adoption and is not actively maintained as a formal, implemented ontology.\n\nIn general, the more actively maintained and widely adopted ontologies tend to be those that have found specific application domains (like BFO in biomedicine) or those that have strong institutional support (like Cyc).

Let me explain how you can implement modularity in OWL2:\n\n<antThinking>Implementing modularity in OWL2 is a complex topic that would benefit from a structured presentation. It's substantial content that users might want to reference or study further. I'll create a new artifact to present this information in a detailed, organized format.</antThinking>\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"owl2-modularity-implementation\" type=\"text/markdown\" title=\"Implementing Modularity in OWL2\">\n# Implementing Modularity in OWL2\n\nModularity in OWL2 can be achieved through several mechanisms and best practices:\n\n## 1. Ontology Partitioning\n\nBreak down your ontology into smaller, logically coherent modules. Each module should be a self-contained OWL ontology file.\n\n```turtle\n# Module A: core.owl\n@prefix : <http://example.org/core#> .\n@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .\n\n<http://example.org/core>\n    a owl:Ontology .\n\n:Entity a owl:Class .\n\n# Module B: physical.owl\n@prefix : <http://example.org/physical#> .\n@prefix core: <http://example.org/core#> .\n@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .\n\n<http://example.org/physical>\n    a owl:Ontology ;\n    owl:imports <http://example.org/core> .\n\n:PhysicalObject a owl:Class ;\n    rdfs:subClassOf core:Entity .\n```\n\n## 2. Imports\n\nUse `owl:imports` to include one module in another. This allows for hierarchical structuring of modules.\n\n```turtle\n@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .\n\n<http://example.org/my-ontology>\n    a owl:Ontology ;\n    owl:imports <http://example.org/module-a>,\n                <http://example.org/module-b> .\n```\n\n## 3. Namespace Management\n\nUse clear and consistent namespaces to avoid conflicts between modules.\n\n```turtle\n@prefix core: <http://example.org/core#> .\n@prefix physical: <http://example.org/physical#> .\n@prefix abstract: <http://example.org/abstract#> .\n```\n\n## 4. Minimal Coupling\n\nDesign modules to be as independent as possible, with well-defined interfaces between them.\n\n## 5. Conservative Extensions\n\nWhen extending a module, ensure that the extension doesn't change the meaning of existing terms.\n\n## 6. Ontology Versioning\n\nUse OWL2's versioning capabilities to manage different versions of modules.\n\n```turtle\n<http://example.org/my-module>\n    a owl:Ontology ;\n    owl:versionIRI <http://example.org/my-module/1.0> .\n```\n\n## 7. Modular Axiomatization\n\nGroup related axioms together in modules, allowing for easier management and reuse.\n\n## 8. Alignment and Bridging Axioms\n\nCreate separate modules for alignments between different ontologies or modules.\n\n```turtle\n@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .\n@prefix : <http://example.org/alignment#> .\n\n<http://example.org/alignment>\n    a owl:Ontology ;\n    owl:imports <http://example.org/ontology-a>,\n                <http://example.org/ontology-b> .\n\n:ConceptA owl:equivalentClass :ConceptB .\n```\n\n## 9. Module Extraction Tools\n\nUse tools like SWOOP, Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, or OWL API for automated module extraction based on signatures or locality.\n\n## 10. Documentation\n\nProvide clear documentation for each module, including its purpose, dependencies, and usage guidelines.\n\nThese techniques can be combined to create a modular, maintainable, and extensible ontology structure in OWL2.\n</antArtifact>\n\nI've created an artifact that outlines various techniques for implementing modularity in OWL2. Here's a summary of the key points:\n\n1. Ontology Partitioning: Break down your ontology into smaller, logically coherent modules.\n2. Imports: Use `owl:imports` to include one module in another.\n3. Namespace Management: Use clear and consistent namespaces to avoid conflicts.\n4. Minimal Coupling: Design modules to be as independent as possible.\n5. Conservative Extensions: Ensure extensions don't change the meaning of existing terms.\n6. Ontology Versioning: Manage different versions of modules.\n7. Modular Axiomatization: Group related axioms together in modules.\n8. Alignment and Bridging Axioms: Create separate modules for alignments between ontologies.\n9. Module Extraction Tools: Use tools for automated module extraction.\n10. Documentation: Provide clear documentation for each module.\n\nImplementing modularity in your upper ontology using these techniques would offer several benefits:\n\n1. Improved maintainability: Smaller modules are easier to understand and update.\n2. Enhanced reusability: Other ontologies can import only the modules they need.\n3. Better collaboration: Different teams can work on different modules simultaneously.\n4. Scalability: The ontology can grow by adding new modules without affecting existing ones.\n5. Flexibility: Users can choose which modules to use based on their specific needs.\n\nWhen applying this to your upper ontology project, you might consider creating separate modules for different high-level categories (e.g., physical entities, abstract entities, processes) and then using imports and alignment modules to create relationships between them. This approach would allow you to maintain consistency with existing upper ontologies while also providing the flexibility to innovate and address any gaps you've identified.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on how you might apply these modularity techniques specifically to your upper ontology project, perhaps with a concrete example?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-26T16:56:42.244655Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-26T16:56:42.244655Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "bf46c9c0-43c5-4544-bee5-ca79754c3a39", "text": "How would modularity be implemented in OWL2?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-26T16:56:42.244655Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-26T16:56:42.244655Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "cb4609cc-19aa-4701-840a-c7eca3bf5d90", "name": "Building GitHub API Integrations with Node.js", "created_at": "2024-09-27T12:51:53.282246Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T17:52:35.910665Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "53e498b3-e442-46d2-b758-4ce0030398f2", "text": "I want to make some transmissions processors (note renaming of 'services') that interact with GitHub's API.

Adjusted the z-index values in the CSS:\n   - Set the canvas z-index to 1 (above foreground elements)\n   - Set the foreground elements z-index to 0 (below the canvas)\n   - Set the debug info z-index to 2 (above everything else)\n\n2. Reordered the elements in the HTML:\n   - Placed the foreground `<div>` elements before the `<canvas>` element\n\nThese changes ensure that the canvas (where the organisms are drawn) is rendered on top of the foreground elements, while still allowing the organisms to interact with these elements through collision detection.\n\nYou should now see:\n- 10 alien fish-amoeba organisms moving around the screen.\n- Three semi-transparent rectangles: one in the center, one in the top-left, and one in the bottom-right.\n- Organisms should be visible at all times, even when passing over the foreground elements.\n- Organisms should still bounce off the foreground elements when they collide with them.\n\nPlease run this version and let me know if the organisms are now visible and interacting correctly with all three foreground elements.

Let's break down the approach and consider some options:\n\n1. Animation Framework:\nInstead of a general-purpose animation toolkit, I'd recommend using the HTML5 Canvas API for this project. It's lightweight, built into modern browsers, and perfect for 2D graphics and animations. You can create a canvas element that covers the entire background of your page.\n\n2. Collision Detection:\nFor detecting collisions with foreground elements, you can use a library like interact.js or write a custom solution using the getBoundingClientRect() method to get the positions and dimensions of DOM elements.\n\n3. A-Life Algorithm:\nYou'll need to implement a custom algorithm for the behavior of your organisms. This can be done in plain JavaScript.\n\nHere's a basic approach to implement this:\n\n<antThinking>This project involves creating a substantial, self-contained piece of interactive content that the user is likely to modify and iterate on.

The canvas hosts 50 colorful circular organisms that move around and bounce off the edges of the screen and the foreground elements.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key components:\n\n1. HTML structure: A canvas element for the background and two div elements as foreground obstacles.\n\n2. CSS: Positions the canvas behind the foreground elements and styles the foreground divs.\n\n3. JavaScript:\n   - Resizes the canvas to fill the window\n   - Defines an Organism class with update and draw methods\n   - Creates 50 organisms\n   - Implements an animation loop using requestAnimationFrame\n\n4. Collision detection: \n   - With canvas borders: Simple boundary checking\n   - With foreground elements: Uses getBoundingClientRect() to get element positions\n\nThis approach is lightweight and doesn't require any external libraries. It uses standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and should work in all modern browsers.\n\nTo extend this demo, you could:\n1. Add more complex behaviors to the organisms (e.g., flocking, predator-prey relationships)\n2. Implement organism reproduction and death\n3. Add user interactions (e.g., clicking to add food or new organisms)\n4.

Here's a breakdown of the enhancements:\n\n1. Fish-amoeba appearance and movement:\n   - The organisms now have a circular body with tentacles.\n   - Movement is more fluid, with gradual direction changes.\n   - Tentacles move independently, creating a more organic look.\n\n2. Reproduction and death:\n   - Organisms have an energy level that decreases over time.\n   - When two organisms collide and both have high energy, they can reproduce.\n   - Organisms die (are removed) when their energy reaches zero.\n\n3. More complex behaviors:\n   - Flocking: Organisms tend to move towards others when they're nearby, but not too close.\n   - Collision avoidance: Organisms bounce off each other and obstacles.\n   - Population control: The simulation maintains a minimum number of organisms.\n\nKey changes and additions:\n\n1. Organism appearance:\n   - Added tentacles that wave around.\n   - Used a blue-green color palette for an underwater feel.\n\n2. Movement:\n   - Implemented smoother movement with gradual velocity changes.\n   - Added boundary checking and foreground element avoidance.\n\n3. Interaction and behavior:\n   - Added an `interact` method for organism-to-organism interactions.\n   - Implemented simple flocking behavior.\n   - Added reproduction when organisms collide with high energy.\n\n4. Life cycle:\n   - Organisms now have energy that decreases over time.\n   - They are removed from the simulation when energy reaches zero.\n   - New organisms are added to maintain a minimum population.\n\n5. Visual enhancements:\n   - Changed the background to a dark blue.\n   - Used a trail effect by drawing a semi-transparent rectangle each frame instead of clearing the canvas.\n\nThis enhanced version creates a more dynamic and interesting simulation of artificial life. The organisms now look and behave more like strange underwater creatures, with reproduction, death, and social behaviors adding to the complexity of the system.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-27T16:07:46.394104Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T16:07:46.394104Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "108baa6f-a607-4755-9b2c-95bc21fbc851", "text": "Please figure out each of these steps one at a time, but show me the finished result.\n1. make the organisms look and move like some weird kind of fish amoeba.\n2.

Added three foreground `<div>` elements with different sizes and positions.\n2. Styled the foreground elements to be visible and distinct from the background.\n3. Modified the `Organism` class's `update` method to detect collisions with the foreground elements and bounce off them.\n\nNow you should see:\n\n1. 50 colorful circular organisms moving around the screen.\n2. Three white rectangular foreground elements: one in the top-left, one in the bottom-right, and one in the center.\n3. The organisms should bounce off both the edges of the screen and the foreground elements.\n\nThis demonstration shows how the organisms interact with obstacles in their environment. The collision detection ensures that the organisms appear to move behind the foreground elements, creating a sense of depth in the 2D space.\n\nLet me know if this is working as expected, and we can move on to the next step of making the organisms look more like fish-amoebas.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-27T16:13:47.271554Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T16:13:47.271554Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "c00a38ee-a957-4d12-81ca-bf2a8a70581e", "text": " I apologize for the oversight.

Added a semi-transparent background refresh to create a trail effect.\n\nYou should now see 10 large, bright cyan circles moving around the dark blue background.

Organism Appearance:\n   - Added tentacles that move independently.\n   - Included a single \"eye\" that follows the direction of movement.\n   - Varied the size of organisms.\n\n2. Color Palette:\n   - Used a more subdued, alien-like color scheme based on blue-green hues.\n   - Implemented a custom color generation function for more control over the palette.\n\n3. Movement:\n   - Made the movement more fluid with subtle speed changes.\n   - Slowed down the overall speed for a more graceful, floating effect.\n\n4. Background and Atmosphere:\n   - Changed the background to a dark blue for an underwater or space-like feel.\n   - Added a trail effect by using a semi-transparent rectangle instead of clearing the canvas each frame.\n\n5. Foreground Elements:\n   - Adjusted the appearance of foreground elements to blend better with the new aesthetic.\n\nNow you should see:\n\n1. 30 alien fish-amoeba-like organisms floating around the screen.\n2. Each organism has a translucent body, moving tentacles, and a single eye.\n3. The color palette is predominantly in the blue-green spectrum, giving an otherworldly appearance.\n4. The organisms leave a slight trail as they move, adding to the alien underwater/space atmosphere.\n5. Three semi-transparent foreground elements that the organisms avoid.\n\nThis version creates a more immersive and alien-like environment while still maintaining the basic mechanics of our original simulation. The organisms now look and behave more like strange, aquatic or space-dwelling life forms.\n\nLet me know if this meets your expectations or if you'd like any further adjustments!", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-27T16:16:19.887364Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T16:16:19.887364Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "33e5d973-fdcc-490d-9090-0241b13cb963", "text": "now the organisms have gone", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-27T16:16:52.825644Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T16:16:52.825644Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "97275192-25e6-400f-8d14-6f2ff9de15e6", "text": "that works", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-27T16:17:22.254010Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T16:17:22.254010Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "b6e62f65-78e7-452f-928c-81852bb7b9be", "text": " Great!

Added tentacles to the organisms, which move independently.\n2. Included an \"eye\" that follows the direction of movement.\n3. Implemented a more sophisticated color generation function for a blue-green alien palette.\n4. Increased the number of organisms to 20 for a more lively simulation.\n5. Varied the size of the organisms slightly for more diversity.\n6. Adjusted the trail effect by reducing the opacity of the background refresh.\n\nYou should now see:\n\n1. 20 alien fish-amoeba-like organisms floating around the screen.\n2. Each organism has a translucent body in shades of blue and green.\n3. The organisms have moving tentacles and a single eye that follows their direction.\n4. The organisms leave a slight trail as they move.\n\nThis version maintains the visibility of the organisms while adding more complex and interesting features. The alien fish-amoeba appearance should now be more apparent.\n\nDoes this version work correctly, and do you see the organisms with their new features? If so, we can proceed to add the foreground elements in the next step.

Shape Modification:\n   - Changed the basic shape from a circle to an elongated form defined by four points.\n   - Two of these points (top and bottom) now wobble independently to create a more organic, undulating movement.\n\n2. Wobble Effect:\n   - Added a `wobbleOffset` and `wobbleSpeed` to each organism to control its undulation.\n   - The wobble is applied to the top and bottom points of the organism's body, creating a wave-like motion as it moves.\n\n3. Orientation:\n   - The organisms now orient themselves in the direction of their movement, making them look more fish-like.\n\n4. Size Adjustments:\n   - Increased the overall size of the organisms for better visibility of the new shape.\n   - The width and height are now separate properties, with the height being 60% of the width to create an elongated shape.\n\n5. Tentacle Adjustments:\n   - Adjusted tentacle positions and lengths to better fit the new body shape.\n\n6. Drawing Method:\n   - Completely rewrote the `draw` method to create the new shape using a series of points that are rotated based on the organism's direction of movement.\n\nYou should now see:\n\n1. 20 elongated, alien fish-amoeba-like organisms moving around the screen.\n2. Each organism has a body that wobbles and undulates as it moves.\n3. The organisms orient themselves in the direction of their movement.\n4. They still have tentacles and an \"eye\", but these are now positioned to fit the new body shape.\n5. The color scheme and trail effect remain the same as before.\n\nThis new version should give a much more dynamic and organic feel to the organisms, making them look even more like strange, alien fish-amoebas.

Foreground Elements:\n   - Added three semi-transparent foreground elements to the HTML.\n   - Styled them to blend better with the alien underwater theme.\n\n2. Collision Detection:\n   - Implemented collision detection with foreground elements in the `update` method.\n   - Organisms now bounce off these elements.\n\n3. Flocking Behavior:\n   - Added a simple flocking algorithm in the `update` method.\n   - Organisms now tend to align their movement with nearby neighbors.\n\n4. Movement Refinement:\n   - Implemented speed limiting to prevent organisms from moving too fast.\n   - Adjusted the movement to be smoother and more fish-like.\n\n5. Population Increase:\n   - Increased the number of organisms to 30 for a more lively simulation.\n\nYou should now see:\n\n1. 30 elongated, wobbling alien fish-amoeba organisms moving around the screen.\n2. Three semi-transparent foreground elements that the organisms avoid and bounce off.\n3. The organisms showing a tendency to move in groups, demonstrating simple flocking behavior.\n4. Smoother, more controlled movement of the organisms.\n\nThis version creates a more complex and interactive environment for our alien fish-amoebas. The combination of obstacle avoidance and flocking behavior should result in interesting, emergent patterns of movement.\n\nLet me know if this meets your expectations or if you'd like any further refinements or additions to the simulation!", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-27T16:21:43.487132Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T16:21:43.487132Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "e194f9e7-b0bd-4d06-b679-2c34c81f19fc", "text": "They are great!!

I apologize for the oversight in the previous version. Let's analyze the code carefully to identify the breaking change.\n\nAfter a thorough review, I believe I've found the issue. In the previous version, we modified the `update` method of the `Organism` class to include flocking behavior and collision detection with foreground elements. However, we made a critical error in how we handled the flocking behavior.\n\nHere's the problematic part of the code:\n\n```javascript\nupdate(organisms) {\n    // ... (other code)\n\n    // Simple flocking behavior\n    let avgDx = 0, avgDy = 0, neighbors = 0;\n    organisms.forEach(other => {\n        if (other !== this) {\n            const distance = Math.hypot(other.x - this.x, other.y - this.y);\n            if (distance < 100) {\n                avgDx += other.dx;\n                avgDy += other.dy;\n                neighbors++;\n            }\n        }\n    });\n    if (neighbors > 0) {\n        this.dx += (avgDx / neighbors - this.dx) * 0.05;\n        this.dy += (avgDy / neighbors - this.dy) * 0.05;\n    }\n\n    // ... (other code)\n}\n```\n\nThe issue is that we're passing the entire `organisms` array to each organism's `update` method, but we never actually pass this argument in our `animate` function. This means that `organisms` is `undefined` within the `update` method, causing an error when we try to call `forEach` on it.\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify our `animate` function to pass the `organisms` array to each organism's `update` method. Here's the corrected version:\n\n<antThinking>We're going to fix the \"alife-debug-demo\" artifact by correcting the update method call in the animate function.

Modified the `Organism` class to create an elongated, wobbling shape.\n2. Added a color generation method for more varied, alien-like colors.\n3. Implemented the wobbling effect using sine waves.\n4. Added an \"eye\" to each organism.\n5. Increased the number of organisms to 20.\n\nYou should now see 20 elongated, wobbling shapes in various blue-green hues moving around the screen. Each organism should have a white \"eye\" that follows its direction of movement.\n\nPlease confirm if you can see these new alien fish-amoeba organisms.

Slowed down the movement and wobble speed of the organisms.\n2. Reduced the number of organisms to 5 for easier tracking.\n3. Changed the boundary behavior from bouncing to wrapping around the screen edges.\n4. Added a debug display that shows the number of organisms and the position and velocity of the first organism.\n5. Increased the opacity of the background refresh to make the trails more visible.\n\nWith these changes, you should be able to see the organisms moving slowly across the screen, wrapping around when they reach the edges. The debug information in the top-left corner should help us understand what's happening with the organisms' positions and velocities.\n\nIf you still can't see the organisms, please check the debug information and let me know what it says. This will help us determine if the organisms are being created and updated correctly, even if they're not visible for some reason.\n\nAlso, if you're comfortable doing so, you could open your browser's developer console (usually accessible by pressing F12) and check for any error messages that might provide more clues about what's going wrong.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-27T16:26:29.751454Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T16:26:29.751454Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "5734ad26-7644-4b84-ba9b-85d82256336c", "text": "Yes, that's displaying.

Restored the original movement speed and number of organisms (20).\n2. Reintroduced the tentacles for a more interesting appearance.\n3. Kept the wrap-around behavior at screen edges for smoother continuous motion.\n4. Maintained the debug information for troubleshooting purposes.\n5. Adjusted the trail effect to be more similar to the original demo.\n\nYou should now see 20 alien fish-amoeba organisms with tentacles, moving around the screen with a slight trail effect. They should wrap around the edges of the screen when they reach the boundaries.\n\nThe debug information in the top-left corner will help us monitor the organisms' behavior while maintaining the visually appealing aspects of the simulation.\n\nPlease let me know if this version is displaying correctly and if it looks more like what you were expecting.

Added three foreground elements as `<div>` elements with the class \"foreground\".\n2. Styled the foreground elements to be semi-transparent and have a subtle border.\n3. Implemented collision detection between organisms and foreground elements.\n4. When an organism collides with a foreground element, it bounces off by reversing its direction.\n5. Adjusted the z-index of canvas, foreground elements, and debug info to ensure proper layering.\n\nYou should now see:\n\n1. 20 alien fish-amoeba organisms moving around the screen, leaving slight trails.\n2. Three semi-transparent foreground elements: one in the top-left, one in the bottom-right, and one in the center.\n3. Organisms bouncing off the foreground elements when they collide.\n4. The debug information still visible in the top-left corner.\n\nThe organisms should interact with both the screen edges (wrapping around) and the foreground elements (bouncing off). This creates a more complex and interesting environment for the organisms to navigate.\n\nPlease let me know if this version is working as expected and if you'd like any further adjustments or additions to the simulation.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-27T16:29:59.040714Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T16:29:59.040714Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "5e90b443-8b66-4f8f-8e4b-ff496e9c27ff", "text": "no organisms.

Let's compare this version with the previous working version to identify and fix the issue.\n\nAfter careful comparison, I've found the problem. In the new version, we added collision detection with foreground elements, but we didn't properly handle the case where organisms might get stuck inside these elements. This could cause them to rapidly change direction and potentially move off-screen or become invisible.\n\nHere's a fixed version that should resolve this issue:\n\n<antThinking>We're going to fix our \"alife-stepwise-debug\" artifact by improving the collision detection and response.

Improved collision detection: We now check for collisions before updating the organism's position, preventing them from entering the foreground elements.\n\n2. Better collision response: We determine which side of the foreground element was hit and only reverse the appropriate velocity component (dx or dy).\n\n3. Movement update: We only update the organism's position if no collision occurred, ensuring they don't get stuck inside foreground elements.\n\n4. Maintained other features: We've kept the wrapping around screen edges, tentacles, wobbling, and debug information.\n\nThis version should now show the organisms interacting properly with both the screen edges and the foreground elements, without disappearing or getting stuck. The debug information will help us confirm that the organisms are still present and moving.\n\nPlease try this version and let me know if the organisms are now visible and behaving as expected.

They should have tentacles, a wobbling body, and an \"eye\". The colors should be varied shades of blue and green.\n\nPlease run this version and let me know if you can still see the organisms.

Added a single foreground element (a div) in the center of the screen.\n2. Implemented basic collision detection in the `update` method of the `Organism` class.\n3. When a collision is detected, the organism simply reverses its direction.\n4.

Adjusted the z-index values in the CSS:\n   - Canvas: z-index: 1 (bottom layer)\n   - Foreground elements: z-index: 2 (middle layer)\n   - Debug info: z-index: 3 (top layer)\n\n2. Increased the opacity of foreground elements:\n   - Changed background color to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)` for better visibility\n   - Increased border opacity to `0.4`\n\n3. Added `pointer-events: none;` to foreground elements to allow click-through\n\n4. Reordered the elements in the HTML to match the desired stacking order\n\nThese changes should ensure that:\n- The canvas (with organisms) is visible at the bottom layer\n- Foreground elements are visible above the canvas but below the debug info\n- Organisms can still be seen when passing \"behind\" the foreground elements\n- Collision detection still works correctly\n\nYou should now see:\n- 10 alien fish-amoeba organisms moving around the screen\n- Three semi-transparent rectangles: one in the center, one in the top-left, and one in the bottom-right\n- Organisms should be visible at all times, appearing to pass \"behind\" the foreground elements\n- Organisms should still bounce off the foreground elements when they collide with them\n\nPlease run this version and let me know if both the organisms and foreground elements are now visible and interacting correctly. This should resolve the visibility issues while maintaining all the functionality we've built so far.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-27T16:37:43.118175Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T16:37:43.118175Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "980b7b6e-7fe3-40c4-83f2-7182bc7d7d57", "text": " Thank you for the feedback.

Improved collision detection and response in the `update` method:\n   - We now calculate the overlap on each side of the foreground element.\n   - We determine which side of the foreground element the organism collided with.\n   - Based on the collision side, we adjust both the position and velocity of the organism.\n   - This prevents organisms from getting stuck inside or at the edges of foreground elements.\n\n2. Removed the `collision` flag and simplified the position update logic.\n\nThese changes should ensure that:\n- Organisms bounce off foreground elements correctly.\n- Organisms don't get stuck inside or at the edges of foreground elements.\n- The simulation maintains its overall behavior and appearance.\n\nYou should now see:\n- 10 alien fish-amoeba organisms moving around the screen.\n- Three semi-transparent foreground elements.\n- Organisms bouncing off the foreground elements naturally, without getting stuck.\n\nPlease run this version and let me know if the stuck organism issue has been resolved. The organisms should now move smoothly around and between the foreground elements without getting trapped.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-27T16:39:56.468377Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T16:39:56.468377Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "91573a2e-0eee-4351-9f78-4d000d597ab1", "text": "that works, except for one smal issue - organisms inside or at the edge of foreground element areas are stuck", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-27T16:39:56.468377Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T16:39:56.468377Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "33e62438-1649-48c8-be3a-848e85b1f892", "text": "that's working!", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-27T16:48:22.295738Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T16:48:22.295738Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "bceb3d2c-ab4b-459c-8a52-b982e8d0f50d", "text": " Excellent!

Added `energy` and `age` properties to the `Organism` class.\n2. Updated the `update` method to decrease energy and increase age each frame.\n3. Implemented a death check based on energy and age.\n4. Modified the `reproduce` method to consume energy when reproducing.\n5. Updated the main animation loop to remove dead organisms.\n6. Updated the debug information to show energy and age of the first organism.\n\nYou should now see:\n\n- Organisms moving around and reproducing as before.\n- Organisms will now die when their energy reaches 0 or their age reaches 3000 frames (about 50 seconds at 60 FPS).\n- The population will fluctuate as organisms reproduce and die.\n- The debug information now shows the energy and age of the first organism (if any exist).\n\nThis implementation creates a more balanced ecosystem where organisms need to manage their energy. They lose energy over time and when reproducing, which limits population growth.\n\nPlease run this version and let me know if the death mechanism is working as expected. If it's functioning well, we can move on to implementing flocking behavior in the next step.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-27T16:48:22.295738Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-27T16:48:22.295738Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "e06ffdfd-4847-4752-8e76-89176ae2ca4d", "text": "great!

Added a `reproduce` method to the `Organism` class.\n2. Implemented a reproduction cooldown to prevent excessive reproduction.\n3. In the `update` method, added a small chance for reproduction each frame.\n4. When reproducing, a new organism is created at the same location as the parent, with slightly smaller size.\n5. The new organism is added to the `organisms` array.\n\nYou should now see:\n- The initial 10 organisms moving around the screen.\n- Over time, new organisms will appear as the existing ones reproduce.\n- The population will gradually increase.\n\nThe debug information in the top-left corner will show the current number of organisms, which should increase over time.\n\nPlease run this version and let me know if the reproduction feature is working as expected.

Added three new methods to the `Organism` class: `separate`, `align`, and `cohere`.\n   - `separate`: Keeps organisms from getting too close to each other.\n   - `align`: Makes organisms try to move in the same direction as their neighbors.\n   - `cohere`: Makes organisms try to move towards the average position of their neighbors.\n\n2. Updated the `update` method to incorporate these flocking behaviors.\n\n3. Implemented a speed limit to prevent organisms from moving too fast.\n\n4. Changed the boundary behavior from bouncing to wrapping around the screen edges.\n\n5. Increased the initial number of organisms to 20 to make the flocking behavior more apparent.\n\nYou should now see:\n\n- Organisms moving in a more coordinated manner, forming loose groups.\n- Organisms separating when they get too close to each other.\n- Organisms aligning their direction of movement with nearby neighbors.\n- Organisms moving towards the center of nearby groups.\n- Organisms wrapping around the screen edges instead of bouncing.\n\nThe flocking behavior should create a more natural and dynamic movement pattern for the organisms. They will still interact with the foreground elements, reproduce, and die as before, but their movement will be more coordinated.\n\nPlease run this version and let me know if the flocking behavior is working as expected.

Added a `Vector2D` class for handling 2D vector operations.\n2. Created separate `MovementBehavior` and `ReproductionBehavior` classes to encapsulate these behaviors.\n3. Simplified the `Organism` class by delegating movement and reproduction logic to their respective behavior classes.\n4. Used the new `Vector2D` class for position and velocity, making the code more readable and easier to manipulate.\n\nThis refactored version maintains all the functionality of the original while improving code organization and modularity. The separation of concerns will make it easier to add new behaviors (like flocking) in the future.\n\nThe simulation should behave exactly as before, but the code is now more maintainable and extensible.

It appears that the issue is occurring when trying to run the `apm` commands. Let's analyze the information and suggest some potential fixes:\n\n1. The apm path seems to be: `/home/danny/HKMS/hkms-desktop/ppm/bin/apm`\n\n2. Both `apm outdated` and `apm ls` commands are failing.\n\nHere are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially fix the issue:\n\n1. Check apm executable:\n   Try running the apm command directly in your terminal:\n   ```\n   /home/danny/HKMS/hkms-desktop/ppm/bin/apm --version\n   ```\n   If this fails, there might be an issue with the apm executable or its permissions.\n\n2. Check permissions:\n   Ensure the apm executable has the correct permissions:\n   ```\n   ls -l /home/danny/HKMS/hkms-desktop/ppm/bin/apm\n   ```\n   It should have execute permissions (x). If not, add them:\n   ```\n   chmod +x /home/danny/HKMS/hkms-desktop/ppm/bin/apm\n   ```\n\n3. Check Node.js version:\n   The apm command uses Node.js. Make sure you have a compatible version installed:\n   ```\n   node --version\n   ```\n   Ensure it meets the requirements for your Pulsar version.\n\n4. Verify PATH:\n   Make sure the directory containing apm is in your PATH:\n   ```\n   echo $PATH\n   ```\n   If it's not, add it to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`:\n   ```\n   export PATH=$PATH:/home/danny/HKMS/hkms-desktop/ppm/bin\n   ```\n\n5. Reinstall apm:\n   If possible, try reinstalling apm:\n   ```\n   npm install -g pulsar-edit/ppm\n   ```\n\n6. Check for conflicting global Node.js packages:\n   Some global Node.js packages might conflict with apm. Try running:\n   ```\n   npm ls -g --depth=0\n   ```\n   Look for any packages that might be conflicting with apm functionality.\n\n7. Modify the `runCommand` method in `package-manager.js` to log more details:\n\n```javascript\nrunCommand(args, callback) {\n  const command = atom.packages.getApmPath();\n  console.log('Running APM command:', command, args);\n  const outputLines = [];\n  const errorLines = [];\n  \n  const apmProcess = new BufferedProcess({\n    command,\n    args,\n    stdout: (lines) => {\n      console.log('APM stdout:', lines);\n      outputLines.push(lines);\n    },\n    stderr: (lines) => {\n      console.error('APM stderr:', lines);\n      errorLines.push(lines);\n    },\n    exit: (code) => {\n      console.log('APM exit code:', code);\n      callback(code, outputLines.join('\\n'), errorLines.join('\\n'));\n    }\n  });\n\n  return handleProcessErrors(apmProcess, `APM command failed: ${args.join(' ')}`, callback);\n}\n```\n\nAfter making these changes and checks, try running the package manager again. If the issue persists, the additional logging should provide more detailed information about what's causing the error.\n\nQ1: Were you able to run the apm command directly in the terminal as suggested?\nQ2: Did you find any permission issues with the apm executable?\nQ3: Are there any error messages or output when running apm commands directly in the terminal?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-17T13:49:52.745006Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-17T13:49:52.745006Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "5b283423-19d2-40f0-8a95-6e1961530f6b", "text": " Thank you for providing the error message and the package-manager.js file. Based on the information given, it appears that the error is occurring when trying to fetch local packages. Let's analyze the code and suggest some potential fixes.\n\n1. First, let's look at the `loadInstalled` method, which is likely where the error is occurring:\n\n```javascript\nloadInstalled(callback) {\n  const args = ['ls', '--json'];\n  const errorMessage = 'Fetching local packages failed.';\n  const apmProcess = this.runCommand(args, function(code, stdout, stderr) {\n    // ... (error handling and callback)\n  });\n\n  return handleProcessErrors(apmProcess, errorMessage, callback);\n}\n```\n\n2. The error seems to be thrown in the `handleProcessErrors` function. Let's modify this function to provide more detailed error information:\n\n```javascript\nconst handleProcessErrors = (apmProcess, message, callback) => {\n  apmProcess.onWillThrowError(({error, handle}) => {\n    handle();\n    const detailedError = createProcessError(message, error);\n    console.error('APM Process Error:', detailedError);\n    return callback(detailedError);\n  });\n};\n```\n\n3. Update the `createProcessError` function to include more details:\n\n```javascript\nconst createProcessError = (message, processError) => {\n  const error = new Error(message);\n  error.stdout = '';\n  error.stderr = processError.message;\n  error.originalError = processError;\n  return error;\n};\n```\n\n4. In the `runCommand` method, add more error logging:\n\n```javascript\nrunCommand(args, callback) {\n  const command = atom.packages.getApmPath();\n  console.log('Running APM command:', command, args);\n  // ... (rest of the method)\n}\n```\n\n5. Check if the `apm` command is available and accessible:\n\n```javascript\nconstructor() {\n  // ... (existing code)\n  this.checkApmAvailability();\n}\n\ncheckApmAvailability() {\n  const apmPath = atom.packages.getApmPath();\n  const fs = require('fs');\n  fs.access(apmPath, fs.constants.X_OK, (err) => {\n    if (err) {\n      console.error('APM is not accessible or executable:', err);\n    } else {\n      console.log('APM is available at:', apmPath);\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\nAfter making these changes, try running the package manager again. The additional logging should provide more information about what's causing the error.\n\nIf the error persists, please check the following:\n\n1. Ensure that the `apm` command is installed and in your system's PATH.\n2. Check if you have the necessary permissions to execute the `apm` command.\n3. Verify that your Pulsar installation is not corrupted.\n\nIf you're still encountering issues, please provide the additional error logs that these changes will generate, and I'll be happy to help further.\n\nQ1: Are you able to run the `apm` command directly from the terminal?\nQ2: Have you recently updated Pulsar or made any changes to its configuration?\nQ3: Are you experiencing this issue with all packages or just specific ones?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-17T13:41:09.293260Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-17T13:41:09.293260Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "b76928dc-6a2c-48f9-bbb4-77522d646891", "text": "Ok, thanks. apm wasn't on the path.

Popularity: Turndown is the clear winner.\n2. Maintenance: Both turndown and node-html-markdown are well-maintained.\n3. Extensibility: Turndown offers the most options for customization and extension.\n\nBased on these factors, turndown seems to align best with your priorities.

It's a common issue when bundling Node.js modules for the browser. The `process` object is typically available in Node.js environments but not in browsers.\n\nTo fix this, you need to provide a polyfill for `process` in your Webpack configuration. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Install the `process` polyfill:\n\n```\nnpm install process\n```\n\n2. Update your Webpack config to include the polyfill:\n\n```javascript\nconst webpack = require('webpack');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ... other config\n  plugins: [\n    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({\n      process: 'process/browser'\n    }),\n  ],\n  resolve: {\n    fallback: {\n      \"process\": require.resolve(\"process/browser\")\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nTo create smaller bundles for debugging:\n\n1. Use code splitting: \n   Split your code into smaller chunks using dynamic imports.\n\n2. Disable minification:\n   Set `optimization.minimize` to `false` in your Webpack config.\n\n3. Enable source maps:\n   Add `devtool: 'source-map'` to your Webpack config.\n\nHere's an example configuration:\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ... other config\n  optimization: {\n    minimize: false,\n    splitChunks: {\n      chunks: 'all',\n    },\n  },\n  devtool: 'source-map',\n};\n```\n\nQ1: Are you using any Node.js-specific libraries that might not be compatible with browsers?\n\nQ2: Have you considered using a tool like Browserify instead of Webpack for bundling Node.js modules?\n\nQ3: Would you like to see an example of how to implement dynamic imports for code splitting?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-30T13:30:13.292491Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-30T13:30:13.292491Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "8aa07253-0062-4f0a-a7ab-852ad40c9ea2", "text": "plugins: [\n        new webpack.ProvidePlugin({\n            process: 'process/browser'\n        }),\n    ],\nresults in \nform-a-matic$ npm run build\n> form-a-matic@1.0.0 build\n> webpack --mode development\n[webpack-cli] Failed to load '/home/danny/github-danny/hyperdata/packages/farelo/form-a-matic/webpack.config.js' config\n[webpack-cli] ReferenceError: webpack is not defined", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-30T13:36:08.730186Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-30T13:36:08.730186Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "24b4c8f0-5535-4a57-8ed1-fde81eab51da", "text": " I apologize for the confusion. The error you're seeing is because `webpack` is not imported in your configuration file. Since you're using ES modules, you'll need to import webpack slightly differently.

This is likely due to compatibility issues between the Linux-based installation script and the Android/Termux environment. Let's break down the problem and explore some potential solutions:\n\n1. Termux Limitations:\n   Termux is a terminal emulator for Android and doesn't provide a full Linux environment. Many Linux commands and system calls may not work as expected.\n\n2. Root Access:\n   The script is trying to use `sudo`, which is not available in Termux by default.\n\n3. Architecture Differences:\n   The script is designed for x86_64 or arm64 Linux systems, but your Android device might have a different architecture.\n\n4. Missing Dependencies:\n   Some required tools or commands might not be available in your Termux installation.\n\nGiven these limitations, here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Manual Installation:\n   Instead of using the installation script, you might need to manually download and install Ollama binaries compatible with your Android device's architecture.\n\n2. Use a Linux Container:\n   You could try running a Linux container within Termux using something like proot-distro, which might provide a more Linux-like environment.\n\n3. Alternative Installation Method:\n   Look for Ollama builds specifically designed for Android or Termux, if available.\n\n4. Build from Source:\n   If Ollama's source code is available, you might be able to compile it directly on your device, though this could be complex.\n\n5. Use a Different Device:\n   Consider using a regular Linux system or a virtual machine if possible, as Ollama might not be fully supported on Android/Termux.\n\nTo proceed, I'd recommend:\n\n1. Check if there's an Ollama version specifically for Android or Termux.\n2. If not, consider using proot-distro to set up a Linux environment within Termux, then try the installation there.\n3. If you're comfortable with compiling software, look into building Ollama from source on your device.\n\nRemember that running AI models like those used by Ollama can be resource-intensive, so performance on a mobile device might be limited even if you get it installed.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-29T16:56:58.197101Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-29T16:56:58.197101Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "efffeb32-34c4-4cbc-8f40-19ee4843b9ba", "text": "Inxi reports kernel as aarch64.

If inxi is reporting your kernel as aarch64, that means your device is using an ARM64 architecture. This is indeed compatible with Ollama's ARM64 install.\n\nARM64 and aarch64 are essentially two names for the same thing:\n- ARM64 is the more common marketing term\n- aarch64 is the architecture name used by Linux\n\nSince Ollama provides an ARM64 install, it should theoretically be compatible with your device. However, there might still be some challenges due to the Android/Termux environment differing from a standard Linux distribution.\n\nHere's what you could try:\n\n1. Download the ARM64 version:\n   Instead of using the install script, try downloading the ARM64 binary directly. You can do this with:\n\n   ```\n   curl -L https://ollama.com/download/ollama-linux-arm64 -o ollama\n   ```\n\n2. Make it executable:\n   ```\n   chmod +x ollama\n   ```\n\n3. Try running it:\n   ```\n   ./ollama\n   ```\n\nIf this doesn't work directly, you might need to set up a more Linux-like environment within Termux. You could try:\n\n1. Install proot-distro:\n   ```\n   pkg install proot-distro\n   ```\n\n2. Install a Linux distribution, like Ubuntu:\n   ```\n   proot-distro install ubuntu\n   ```\n\n3. Log into the Ubuntu environment:\n   ```\n   proot-distro login ubuntu\n   ```\n\n4. Then try the Ollama ARM64 installation steps within this environment.\n\nRemember that even if you get Ollama installed, running large language models on a mobile device can be very resource-intensive and may not perform well. Also, be aware of your device's storage and memory limitations.\n\nIf you encounter specific errors during this process, please share them, and I can provide more targeted assistance.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-29T17:03:34.931540Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-29T17:03:34.931540Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "ab2d52de-bc1d-46ff-b899-3f3049c354d0", "name": "Optimizing Webpack Configuration", "created_at": "2024-09-30T13:46:41.263515Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-30T14:02:57.172945Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "9e43fe13-4d14-4f6e-a569-5c13c11e19c7", "text": "I've attached my current webpack config.

Webhooks are indeed one option, but let's explore the possibilities to find the best fit for your needs.\n\n1. Webhooks:\nWebhooks can certainly be used for this purpose. In this case, you'd set up an endpoint on your server that, when called via HTTPS, triggers the Node.js script. This is a good option if you want external services to be able to trigger your script.\n\n2. Simple HTTP Endpoint:\nIf you don't need the full webhook functionality, you can create a simple HTTP endpoint in your Node.js application that, when accessed, runs your script. This is similar to a webhook but might be simpler to implement if you don't need features like authentication or payload processing.\n\n3. Reverse Proxy with Nginx:\nYou can use Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward HTTPS requests to your Node.js application. This allows you to handle the HTTPS connection in Nginx (which is very efficient at this) and pass the request to your Node.js app.\n\nHere's a basic approach combining options 2 and 3:\n\n1. Create an endpoint in your Node.js application:\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst { exec } = require('child_process');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get('/run-script', (req, res) => {\n  exec('node /path/to/your/script.js', (error, stdout, stderr) => {\n    if (error) {\n      console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);\n      return res.status(500).send('Error running script');\n    }\n    res.send('Script executed successfully');\n  });\n});\n\napp.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));\n```\n\n2. Configure Nginx to proxy requests to your Node.js app:\n\n```nginx\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl;\n    server_name your-domain.com;\n\n    ssl_certificate /path/to/your/certificate.crt;\n    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/certificate.key;\n\n    location /run-script {\n        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis setup allows you to make an HTTPS call to `https://your-domain.com/run-script`, which will trigger your Node.js script.\n\nRemember to consider security implications:\n- Add authentication to your endpoint to prevent unauthorized access.\n- Use HTTPS to encrypt the communication.\n- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.\n\nThe best approach depends on your specific needs, but this method provides a straightforward way to trigger a script via an HTTPS call using Nginx and Node.js.", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-30T15:09:51.631293Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-30T15:09:51.631293Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "52a97257-01ed-4c43-907c-b9653af66ccc", "name": "Optimizing Webpack Bundle for Browser-Specific Code", "created_at": "2024-09-30T14:28:55.673405Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-30T14:29:38.271096Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "5a02fe79-a936-4c6d-8a0e-18b5e9d817fe", "text": "I suspect webpack is bundling up a lot of code that isn't needed in by final html app. The other js files are only used to generate the html with node.

Given the setup you've described, the most reliable method would likely be based on Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) measurements. Here's a detailed explanation of how this could work:\n\n1. Unique Pulse Sequences:\nFirst, each transmitter should be assigned a unique pulse sequence. This could be achieved using different pulse patterns or codes for each transmitter, such as Gold codes or other orthogonal sequences. This allows the receiver to distinguish between the signals from different transmitters.\n\n2. Time Synchronization:\nSince the transmitters can time sync with each other, they should all start transmitting their unique sequences simultaneously. This provides a common time reference for all transmitters.\n\n3. TDOA Measurements:\nThe receiver will detect the pulses from all four transmitters. Due to the different distances between each transmitter and the receiver, the pulses will arrive at slightly different times. The receiver can measure these time differences.\n\n4. Cross-correlation:\nTo accurately determine the arrival time of each transmitter's signal, the receiver should use cross-correlation between the received signal and the known unique sequences for each transmitter. This will provide precise timing information for each transmitter's signal.\n\n5. Hyperbolic Positioning:\nUsing the TDOA measurements, the receiver can calculate hyperbolic curves representing the possible locations of each transmitter relative to the others. The intersection of these hyperbolas will give the relative positions of the transmitters.\n\n6. Distance Calculation:\nKnowing the speed of sound in the medium (assuming these are acoustic transmitters), the relative distances can be calculated from the time differences.\n\nThis method is reliable because:\n\na) It doesn't rely on amplitude measurements, which can be affected by attenuation and interference.\nb) Using unique sequences allows for clear identification of each transmitter's signal.\nc) Time-based measurements can be very precise, especially with good synchronization.\nd) It works well in multipath-free environments, as specified in your scenario.\n\nTo further improve reliability:\n\n1. Use error-correcting codes in the pulse sequences to improve robustness against noise.\n2. Implement a Kalman filter or other estimation techniques to smooth out measurements over time.\n3. If possible, use multiple measurements and average the results to reduce the impact of any single erroneous measurement.\n\n4.

You can refer to this for a comprehensive overview of chunking strategies.\n\nTo decide on the best chunking method for your specific scenario, I recommend the following steps:\n\n1. Start with a baseline:\nBegin with a simple fixed-size chunking method as your baseline. This could be, for example, chunks of 512 tokens.\n\n2. Experiment and evaluate:\nTest different chunking methods from the artifact (fixed-size, sentence-based, paragraph-based, sliding window, etc.) on a subset of your data. Evaluate their performance in terms of:\n   - Retrieval accuracy\n   - Relevance of retrieved chunks\n   - Coverage of important information\n\n3. Consider hybrid approaches:\nBased on your initial results, consider combining methods. For example, you might use paragraph-based chunking with a maximum size limit to prevent overly large chunks.\n\n4. Fine-tune parameters:\nAdjust parameters like chunk size, overlap amount (for sliding window), or topic granularity based on your evaluation results.\n\n5. Validate with real queries:\nTest your chosen method with actual user queries or expected query patterns to ensure it performs well in practice.\n\n6. Monitor and iterate:\nImplement your chosen method, but continue to monitor its performance. Be prepared to refine your approach as you gather more data on real-world usage.\n\nRemember, the best chunking method often depends on your specific use case and data.

You'd typically use algorithms like LDA or more recent transformer-based models to identify the underlying topics in your corpus. The choice of topic model can significantly impact the quality of your chunks.\n\n2. Text Segmentation: This step is crucial for identifying potential chunk boundaries. Algorithms like TextTiling analyze the coherence between adjacent blocks of text to detect topic shifts. When combined with topic modeling (as in TopicTiling), it can provide more semantically meaningful segmentation.\n\n3. Boundary Refinement: After initial segmentation, you'll want to refine the boundaries to ensure they align with natural language structures (like sentence or paragraph breaks) and maintain coherence within each chunk.\n\n4. Metadata Tagging: This step enhances the usefulness of your chunks for retrieval. By tagging each chunk with its dominant topics or key terms, you can improve the accuracy of semantic search and provide additional context for RAG systems.\n\n5. Index Management: Efficient storage and retrieval of chunks is crucial for system performance. You'll need to generate vector embeddings for each chunk and store them in a structure that allows for fast similarity search.\n\nImplementing topic-based chunking can be complex and computationally intensive, but it often results in more semantically coherent chunks that can improve the performance of downstream tasks like semantic search and RAG.\n\nWould you like me to dive deeper into any specific subsystem or aspect of the implementation process?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-09-30T23:57:05.407920Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-30T23:57:05.407920Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "d448daa3-861b-42ff-b219-74b59a5aa43a", "text": "How might hierarchical topic modelling be implemented using the class/subclass and property/subproperty data model of rdf?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-10-01T00:02:16.982765Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T00:02:16.982765Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "fa91441a-e661-462c-9e6c-e120e6b3c7af", "text": " Implementing hierarchical topic modeling using the RDF (Resource Description Framework) data model with its class/subclass and property/subproperty structure is an interesting approach that can leverage the semantic web technologies.

This approach leverages the semantic web's data model to create a rich, interconnected representation of topics.\n\nTo elaborate on some key points:\n\n1. RDF Structure: The core of this approach is defining topics as RDF resources with class hierarchies (:Topic, :MainTopic, :SubTopic) and relationships (:hasSubTopic). This allows for a flexible and expressive representation of the topic hierarchy.\n\n2. Topic Attributes: Using RDF properties like :hasKeyword and :hasProbability, we can attach relevant metadata to each topic. This enriches the model and allows for more nuanced analysis.\n\n3. Implementation Process: The process involves initial topic modeling using traditional techniques, converting the results to RDF, and then refining the hierarchy using semantic web technologies.\n\n4. Querying and Analysis: One of the major advantages of this approach is the ability to use SPARQL for complex queries on the topic hierarchy. This allows for sophisticated analysis of the topic structure.\n\n5. Reasoning Capabilities: By leveraging ontology reasoning, we can infer additional relationships between topics, potentially uncovering hidden connections in the topic structure.\n\nSome challenges to consider:\n\n1. Scalability: As the topic hierarchy grows, you may need to use optimized triple stores and query techniques to maintain performance.\n\n2. Complexity: This approach requires familiarity with semantic web technologies, which may increase the learning curve for implementation and maintenance.\n\n3. Dynamic Updates: As new documents are added or the corpus evolves, you'll need strategies to update the topic hierarchy while maintaining consistency.\n\nTo implement this in practice, you might use libraries like RDFLib in Python for RDF manipulation, and tools like Apache Jena for storage and querying of large RDF datasets.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this implementation, such as the RDF structure, the topic modeling process, or strategies for querying and analyzing the resulting hierarchy?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T00:02:16.982765Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T00:02:16.982765Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "4e69b4df-01d4-476c-8cfb-17cb3c25251d", "name": "Estimating Text Length from LLM Token Count", "created_at": "2024-09-30T20:11:25.213078Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-30T20:20:05.440517Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "5152609b-a1e9-4642-a3a4-ecc45a03955b", "text": "Roughly how many pages of regular text (say A4 academic papers) corresponds to 128k tokens for a typical llm?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-09-30T20:11:30.477218Z", "updated_at": "2024-09-30T20:11:30.477218Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "521c0435-2c9d-4505-ad12-dd117be3aa8a", "text": " To estimate how many pages of regular text correspond to 128,000 tokens for a typical language model, we need to make a few assumptions:\n\n1.

Use a JavaScript engine: The most common choice is to use the Duktape engine, which is a lightweight JavaScript engine that can be embedded in Android apps.\n\n2. Create a bridge between Java and JavaScript: You'll need to set up a way for your Java code to communicate with the JavaScript environment.\n\n3. Load and execute Node.js scripts: You'll need to load your Node.js scripts into the JavaScript engine and execute them.\n\nHere's a basic outline of the steps you might follow:\n\n1. Add Duktape to your project:\n   Add the Duktape library to your Android project's dependencies.\n\n2. Set up the JavaScript environment:\n   Initialize the Duktape engine in your Java code.\n\n3. Create a bridge between Java and JavaScript:\n   Implement methods to pass data between Java and JavaScript.\n\n4. Load and execute Node.js scripts:\n   Load your Node.js scripts as strings and evaluate them using the Duktape engine.\n\nKeep in mind that this approach has limitations. You won't have access to Node.js-specific APIs or the full Node.js runtime environment. You'll only be able to run pure JavaScript code and whatever additional functionality you provide through the Java-JavaScript bridge.\n\nIf you'd like, I can provide a simple code example demonstrating these concepts.

FIPA Agent Management Ontology:\n\nThe Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA) developed an ontology for describing and managing software agents. This ontology is expressed in both natural language and formal notation.\n\nKey features:\n- Uses RDF and OWL for formal representation\n- Describes agent properties, services, and protocols\n- Includes concepts like AgentIdentifier, AgentPlatform, and ServiceDescription\n\n2.

DAML-S (DARPA Agent Markup Language for Services):\n\nWhile primarily focused on web services, DAML-S also provides constructs for describing agent-based services.\n\nKey features:\n- Based on DAML+OIL, a predecessor to OWL\n- Describes service profiles, process models, and groundings\n- Can be used to describe agent services and capabilities\n\n4. The Cognitive Agent Ontology:\n\nDeveloped to describe cognitive architectures and agents with an emphasis on human-like reasoning.\n\nKey features:\n- Uses OWL for formal representation\n- Describes cognitive processes, memory structures, and learning mechanisms\n- Includes concepts like Belief, Goal, Plan, and Intention\n\nThese classification systems provide formal ways to describe and categorize software agents, including AI agents. They use semantic web technologies like RDF and OWL, which allow for machine-readable representations and logical reasoning about agent properties and capabilities.\n\nThe use of formal languages in these systems offers several advantages:\n1. Standardization: Provides a common vocabulary for describing agents across different platforms and domains.\n2. Interoperability: Enables different systems to understand and interact with agents described using these ontologies.\n3. Reasoning: Allows for automated reasoning about agent capabilities and behaviors.\n4.

The button action in `json-to-html.js` isn't properly passing the `extract(document)` function to the output. Let's modify the code to ensure the button action works correctly.\n\nHere's the updated `jsonFileToHtmlForm` method in `json-to-html.js`:\n\n```javascript\nasync jsonFileToHtmlForm(templatePath, filePath) {\n    try {\n        await this.initDOM(templatePath);\n\n        const jsonString = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');\n        const jsonData = JSON.parse(jsonString);\n        const formElement = this.jsonToHtmlForm(jsonData);\n\n        const submitButton = this.document.createElement('button');\n        submitButton.textContent = 'Submit';\n        submitButton.type = 'button';\n        \n        // Use a script element to add the button action\n        const script = this.document.createElement('script');\n        script.textContent = `\n            document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', function() {\n                const output = window.extract(document);\n                document.getElementById('output').value = output;\n            });\n        `;\n\n        const form = formElement;\n        form.appendChild(submitButton);\n\n        const outputLabel = this.document.createElement('label');\n        outputLabel.textContent = 'Output';\n        outputLabel.htmlFor = 'output';\n        form.appendChild(outputLabel);\n\n        const outputTextarea = this.document.createElement('textarea');\n        outputTextarea.id = 'output';\n        outputTextarea.rows = 10;\n        form.appendChild(outputTextarea);\n\n        this.document.body.appendChild(formElement);\n        this.document.body.appendChild(script);\n\n        return this.dom.serialize();\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error reading or parsing JSON file:', error);\n        throw error;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis modification does the following:\n\n1. We create a `script` element to add the button action.\n2. The script adds an event listener to the submit button.\n3. When clicked, it calls `window.extract(document)` and sets the output to the textarea.\n4. We append both the form and the script to the document body.\n\nThis approach ensures that the `extract` function is called correctly when the button is clicked in the browser environment.\n\nQ1: How can we ensure that the `extract` function is available in the global scope when the button is clicked?\n\nQ2: Are there any potential security concerns with adding inline scripts to the generated HTML?\n\nQ3: How can we improve error handling in case the `extract` function fails or is not available?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T12:35:15.202377Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T12:35:15.202377Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "c964662d-128d-42f8-8127-2e98c8b30d99", "text": "button click isn't triggering the script", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-10-01T12:44:50.323273Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T12:44:50.323273Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "7d1d82ab-a1be-434a-8d9e-d6f96823a74b", "text": " Thank you for providing the console output. It's clear that the script is loading and the button click event is being triggered correctly. However, the main issue is that `window.extract` is not defined as a function. Let's address this problem.\n\nThe error \"window.extract is not a function\" suggests that the `extract` function is not being properly assigned to the global scope. Here are the steps to fix this:\n\n1. First, ensure that your `browser-entry.js` file is correctly importing and assigning the `extract` function:\n\n```javascript\nimport { extract } from './public/extractor.js';\n\nwindow.extract = extract;\n\nconsole.log('Extract function assigned to window:', typeof window.extract);\n```\n\n2. Make sure that the `browser-entry.js` file is being properly bundled and included in your HTML. In your webpack configuration (`webpack.config.js`), ensure that this file is set as the entry point:\n\n```javascript\nexport default {\n    entry: './src/browser-entry.js',\n    // ... rest of your webpack config\n};\n```\n\n3. In your HTML file, make sure you're including the bundled JavaScript file. Add this line just before the closing `</body>` tag in your `foaf-form.html`:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"webpack/main.bundle.js\"></script>\n```\n\n4. To further debug, let's modify the script in `json-to-html.js` to check if the `extract` function is available:\n\n```javascript\nconst script = this.document.createElement('script');\nscript.textContent = `\n    console.log('Script loaded');\n    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n        console.log('DOM fully loaded');\n        console.log('window.extract:', window.extract);\n        var button = document.getElementById('submitButton');\n        console.log('Submit button:', button);\n        if (button) {\n            button.addEventListener('click', function() {\n                console.log('Button clicked');\n                if (typeof window.extract === 'function') {\n                    console.log('Calling extract function');\n                    var output = window.extract(document);\n                    document.getElementById('output').value = output;\n                    console.log('Output set');\n                } else {\n                    console.error('window.extract is not a function. window.extract:', window.extract);\n                }\n            });\n            console.log('Click event listener added');\n        } else {\n            console.error('Submit button not found');\n        }\n    });\n`;\n```\n\nAfter making these changes, rebuild your project and test again. Check the console for any new log messages, especially the one logging `window.extract`.\n\nQ1: After implementing these changes, what does the console log for `window.extract` show?\n\nQ2: Is the `main.bundle.js` file being loaded correctly in the browser? Can you see it in the network tab of your browser's developer tools?\n\nQ3: Are there any errors in the console related to loading or parsing the JavaScript files?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T12:48:46.103966Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T12:48:46.103966Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "046d69e0-5513-4c36-b83e-5a3278c28ea9", "text": " I apologize for the oversight. Let's debug this issue step by step. First, we need to ensure that the button click event is properly attached and that the `extract` function is available in the global scope.\n\nLet's modify the `jsonFileToHtmlForm` method in `json-to-html.js` to include more robust event handling and debugging:\n\n```javascript\nasync jsonFileToHtmlForm(templatePath, filePath) {\n    try {\n        await this.initDOM(templatePath);\n\n        const jsonString = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');\n        const jsonData = JSON.parse(jsonString);\n        const formElement = this.jsonToHtmlForm(jsonData);\n\n        const submitButton = this.document.createElement('button');\n        submitButton.textContent = 'Submit';\n        submitButton.type = 'button';\n        submitButton.id = 'submitButton';\n        \n        const script = this.document.createElement('script');\n        script.textContent = `\n            console.log('Script loaded');\n            document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {\n                console.log('DOM fully loaded and parsed');\n                const button = document.getElementById('submitButton');\n                if (button) {\n                    console.log('Submit button found');\n                    button.addEventListener('click', function() {\n                        console.log('Button clicked');\n                        if (typeof window.extract === 'function') {\n                            try {\n                                const output = window.extract(document);\n                                document.getElementById('output').value = output;\n                                console.log('Extraction completed');\n                            } catch (error) {\n                                console.error('Error during extraction:', error);\n                                document.getElementById('output').value = 'Error: ' + error.message;\n                            }\n                        } else {\n                            console.error('extract function not found');\n                            document.getElementById('output').value = 'Error: extract function not found';\n                        }\n                    });\n                } else {\n                    console.error('Submit button not found');\n                }\n            });\n        `;\n\n        const form = formElement;\n        form.appendChild(submitButton);\n\n        const outputLabel = this.document.createElement('label');\n        outputLabel.textContent = 'Output';\n        outputLabel.htmlFor = 'output';\n        form.appendChild(outputLabel);\n\n        const outputTextarea = this.document.createElement('textarea');\n        outputTextarea.id = 'output';\n        outputTextarea.rows = 10;\n        form.appendChild(outputTextarea);\n\n        this.document.body.appendChild(formElement);\n        this.document.head.appendChild(script);\n\n        return this.dom.serialize();\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error reading or parsing JSON file:', error);\n        throw error;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nKey changes:\n\n1. We've added an ID to the submit button for easier selection.\n2. The script now uses `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before attaching the event listener.\n3. We've added extensive console logging for debugging.\n4. We're checking if `window.extract` is a function before calling it.\n5. We've added error handling around the `extract` function call.\n6. The script is now appended to the document's `head` instead of `body` for better practice.\n\nAfter making these changes, please ensure that:\n\n1. The `extract` function is properly defined and attached to the `window` object in your `browser-entry.js` file.\n2.

We'll modify the code to add more visibility into what's happening and ensure the event listener is properly attached.\n\nHere's an updated version of the `jsonFileToHtmlForm` method:\n\n```javascript\nasync jsonFileToHtmlForm(templatePath, filePath) {\n    try {\n        await this.initDOM(templatePath);\n\n        const jsonString = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');\n        const jsonData = JSON.parse(jsonString);\n        const formElement = this.jsonToHtmlForm(jsonData);\n\n        const submitButton = this.document.createElement('button');\n        submitButton.textContent = 'Submit';\n        submitButton.type = 'button';\n        submitButton.id = 'submitButton'; // Add an ID for easy reference\n\n        const form = formElement;\n        form.appendChild(submitButton);\n\n        const outputLabel = this.document.createElement('label');\n        outputLabel.textContent = 'Output';\n        outputLabel.htmlFor = 'output';\n        form.appendChild(outputLabel);\n\n        const outputTextarea = this.document.createElement('textarea');\n        outputTextarea.id = 'output';\n        outputTextarea.rows = 10;\n        form.appendChild(outputTextarea);\n\n        this.document.body.appendChild(formElement);\n\n        // Add a script element with more detailed logging\n        const script = this.document.createElement('script');\n        script.textContent = `\n            console.log('Script loaded');\n            document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n                console.log('DOM fully loaded');\n                var button = document.getElementById('submitButton');\n                console.log('Submit button:', button);\n                if (button) {\n                    button.addEventListener('click', function() {\n                        console.log('Button clicked');\n                        try {\n                            if (typeof window.extract === 'function') {\n                                console.log('Calling extract function');\n                                var output = window.extract(document);\n                                document.getElementById('output').value = output;\n                                console.log('Output set');\n                            } else {\n                                console.error('window.extract is not a function');\n                            }\n                        } catch (error) {\n                            console.error('Error in extract function:', error);\n                        }\n                    });\n                    console.log('Click event listener added');\n                } else {\n                    console.error('Submit button not found');\n                }\n            });\n        `;\n\n        this.document.head.appendChild(script);\n\n        return this.dom.serialize();\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error reading or parsing JSON file:', error);\n        throw error;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nKey changes:\n\n1. Added an ID to the submit button for easier reference.\n2. Moved the script to the head of the document.\n3. Wrapped the event listener in a `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure the DOM is fully loaded before attaching the listener.\n4. Added more detailed console logging throughout the process.\n5. Added error handling and checking if `window.extract` is a function.\n\nThese changes should help us identify where the issue might be occurring. After implementing these changes, please check the browser console for any error messages or logs when you click the button.\n\nAdditionally, make sure that the `extract` function is properly defined and available in the global scope. In your `browser-entry.js` file, ensure it's being assigned to the window object:\n\n```javascript\nimport { extract } from './public/extractor.js';\n\nwindow.extract = extract;\n```\n\nQ1: After implementing these changes, what logs or errors do you see in the browser console when clicking the button?\n\nQ2: Is the `extract` function properly imported and assigned to the window object in your `browser-entry.js` file?\n\nQ3: Are there any CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues that might be preventing the script from executing properly?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T12:45:03.712684Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T12:45:03.712684Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "bac9abd2-6470-43df-8585-57c09142f5c6", "text": "Script loaded\nfoaf-form.html:12 DOM fully loaded\nfoaf-form.html:14 Submit button: <button type=\"button\" id=\u200b\"submitButton\">\u200bSubmit\u200b</button>\u200b\nfoaf-form.html:31 Click event listener added\nfoaf-form.html:17 Button clicked\nfoaf-form.html:25 window.extract is not a function\n(anonymous) @ foaf-form.html:25", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-10-01T12:48:46.103966Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T12:48:46.103966Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "8429fca8-c35d-402a-9a42-45bff1cd3624", "text": "Button clicked\nfoaf-form.html:25 window.extract is not a function. window.extract: undefined\n(anonymous) @ foaf-form.html:25", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-10-01T13:06:40.039016Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T13:06:40.039016Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "c6a86c47-5b22-46f1-9d88-20e2719ed64c", "text": " Thank you for the update. It's clear that `window.extract` is still undefined when the button is clicked. Let's troubleshoot this issue step by step:\n\n1. First, let's verify that the `browser-entry.js` file is being bundled correctly:\n\n   Open your `webpack.config.js` and ensure it has the correct entry point:\n\n   ```javascript\n   export default {\n     entry: './src/browser-entry.js',\n     output: {\n       filename: 'main.bundle.js',\n       path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/public/webpack'),\n     },\n     // ... rest of your config\n   };\n   ```\n\n2. Next, let's modify `browser-entry.js` to explicitly log when it's loaded:\n\n   ```javascript\n   import { extract } from './public/extractor.js';\n\n   console.log('browser-entry.js loaded');\n   window.extract = extract;\n   console.log('Extract function assigned to window:', typeof window.extract);\n   ```\n\n3. In your `foaf-form.html`, ensure the script tag is placed correctly:\n\n   ```html\n   <body>\n     <!-- Your form and other content here -->\n     <script src=\"webpack/main.bundle.js\"></script>\n   </body>\n   ```\n\n4. Let's also add a small inline script to check if `window.extract` is available after the main bundle is loaded:\n\n   ```html\n   <body>\n     <!-- Your form and other content here -->\n     <script src=\"webpack/main.bundle.js\"></script>\n     <script>\n       console.log('Inline script: window.extract is', typeof window.extract);\n     </script>\n   </body>\n   ```\n\n5. Rebuild your project with `npm run build` (or whatever command you use to run webpack).\n\n6. Clear your browser cache and reload the page.\n\nAfter making these changes, check the console logs again. You should see logs from `browser-entry.js` and the inline script.\n\nQ1: Do you see the logs from `browser-entry.js` in the console? If not, is there an error related to loading `main.bundle.js`?\n\nQ2: What does the inline script log about `window.extract`?

Let's modify `browser-entry.js` to explicitly log when it's executed:\n\n   ```javascript\n   import { extract } from './public/extractor.js';\n\n   console.log('browser-entry.js is executing');\n   console.log('extract function:', extract);\n\n   window.extract = extract;\n\n   console.log('window.extract has been set:', window.extract);\n   ```\n\n3. In your `webpack.config.js`, ensure that the output is configured correctly:\n\n   ```javascript\n   output: {\n     filename: 'main.bundle.js',\n     path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/public/webpack'),\n   },\n   ```\n\n4. Let's also add a simple test function to `browser-entry.js` to verify that global assignments are working:\n\n   ```javascript\n   window.testFunction = function() {\n     console.log('Test function executed');\n   };\n   ```\n\n5. Modify the script in `json-to-html.js` to test this function:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const script = this.document.createElement('script');\n   script.textContent = `\n     console.log('Script loaded');\n     document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n       console.log('DOM fully loaded');\n       console.log('window.extract:', window.extract);\n       console.log('window.testFunction:', window.testFunction);\n       var button = document.getElementById('submitButton');\n       if (button) {\n         button.addEventListener('click', function() {\n           console.log('Button clicked');\n           if (typeof window.extract === 'function') {\n             console.log('Calling extract function');\n             var output = window.extract(document);\n             document.getElementById('output').value = output;\n           } else {\n             console.error('window.extract is not a function');\n           }\n           if (typeof window.testFunction === 'function') {\n             window.testFunction();\n           } else {\n             console.error('window.testFunction is not a function');\n           }\n         });\n       }\n     });\n   `;\n   ```\n\nAfter making these changes, rebuild your project and test again. \n\nQ1: Do you see the logs from `browser-entry.js` in the console when you load the page?\n\nQ2: Is the `testFunction` available and executable when you click the button?\n\nQ3: Are there any errors in the console related to loading `main.bundle.js`?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T13:06:32.220272Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T13:06:32.220272Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "9e72ab43-5d2b-4a1b-9719-269ae22b1b90", "text": "Button clicked\nfoaf-form.html:25 window.extract is not a function. window.extract: undefined\n(anonymous) @ foaf-form.html:25", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-10-01T13:06:32.220272Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T13:06:32.220272Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "7fa1fb4f-01fd-4a0a-b633-9e2db46efc04", "name": "Checking Understanding", "created_at": "2024-10-01T13:50:34.976807Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T14:18:40.074033Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "cb216a44-277e-489a-a050-10d427e83536", "text": " I understan", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T13:50:49.343437Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T13:50:49.343437Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "d2a3914d-3458-499b-9fd8-9a0152bf7c3f", "text": "please check that", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-10-01T13:50:49.343437Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T13:50:49.343437Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "1ff4b9a6-b0e5-448e-9d1d-edcd587f7598", "text": "The generation of foaf-form.html is working correctly, but when opened in a browser it produces the error below.

Let's address them step by step:\n\n1. Script loading order:\nThe main bundle script should be loaded before any inline scripts that use its functionality. In the current HTML, the bundle is loaded after the inline script that checks for `window.extract`.\n\n2. Webpack configuration:\nThe current webpack configuration might not be exposing the `extract` function globally.\n\n3. Browser entry point:\nThe `browser-entry.js` file should explicitly attach the `extract` function to the window object.\n\nLet's make the following changes:\n\n1. Update `json-to-html.js` to change the script order:\n\n```javascript\ncreateClientScript() {\n    const script = this.document.createElement('script');\n    script.textContent = `\n        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n            console.log('DOM fully loaded');\n            console.log('window.extract:', window.extract);\n            var button = document.getElementById('submitButton');\n            if (button) {\n                button.addEventListener('click', function() {\n                    console.log('Button clicked');\n                    if (typeof window.extract === 'function') {\n                        console.log('Calling extract function');\n                        var output = window.extract(document);\n                        document.getElementById('output').value = output;\n                    } else {\n                        console.error('window.extract is not a function. window.extract:', window.extract);\n                    }\n                });\n            } else {\n                console.error('Submit button not found');\n            }\n        });\n    `;\n    return script;\n}\n\nasync jsonFileToHtmlForm(templatePath, filePath) {\n    // ... (existing code)\n\n    // Move the bundle script to the head\n    const bundleScript = this.document.createElement('script');\n    bundleScript.src = \"webpack/main.bundle.js\";\n    this.document.head.appendChild(bundleScript);\n\n    // Add the client script after the bundle\n    this.document.head.appendChild(this.createClientScript());\n\n    // ... (rest of the existing code)\n}\n```\n\n2. Update `webpack.config.js` to expose the `extract` function:\n\n```javascript\nimport webpack from 'webpack';\nconst { ProvidePlugin } = webpack;\n\nexport default {\n    // ... (existing config)\n    output: {\n        filename: '[name].bundle.js',\n        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/public/webpack'),\n        library: {\n            name: 'FormAMatic',\n            type: 'umd',\n            export: 'default'\n        },\n        globalObject: 'this'\n    },\n    // ... (rest of the existing config)\n};\n```\n\n3. Update `browser-entry.js`:\n\n```javascript\nimport { extract } from './public/extractor.js';\n\nconst FormAMatic = {\n    extract: extract\n};\n\nif (typeof window !== 'undefined') {\n    window.FormAMatic = FormAMatic;\n    window.extract = extract;\n}\n\nexport default FormAMatic;\n```\n\n4. Finally, update the inline script in `foaf-form.html` to use the new global object:\n\n```html\n<script>\n    console.log('Inline script: window.FormAMatic is', typeof window.FormAMatic);\n    console.log('Inline script: window.extract is', typeof window.extract);\n</script>\n```\n\nThese changes should ensure that:\n1. The main bundle is loaded before any inline scripts.\n2. The `extract` function is properly exposed to the global scope.\n3. The `DOMContentLoaded` event listener waits for the DOM to be fully loaded before attempting to use the `extract` function.\n\nAfter making these changes, rebuild your project and test the `foaf-form.html` in the browser. The error should be resolved, and you should be able to use the `extract` function when clicking the submit button.\n\nQ1: Are there any other areas in the codebase that might need to be updated to ensure compatibility with these changes?\n\nQ2: How can we add error handling to gracefully manage situations where the `extract` function might not be available?\n\nQ3: Would it be beneficial to add a loading indicator or disable the submit button until we confirm that the `extract` function is available?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T13:57:15.285972Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T13:57:15.285972Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "46d362f7-8f34-4cda-8e17-3f096eb45ab8", "text": " I've reviewed the code and identified the issue. The problem is that the `extract` function is not being properly exposed to the global scope. Let's fix this by making some adjustments to the `json-to-html.js` file and the generated HTML.\n\n1. In `json-to-html.js`, modify the `createClientScript` method:\n\n```javascript\ncreateClientScript() {\n    const script = this.document.createElement('script');\n    script.textContent = `\n        console.log('Script loaded');\n        window.addEventListener('load', function() {\n            console.log('Window fully loaded');\n            console.log('window.extract:', window.extract);\n            var button = document.getElementById('submitButton');\n            console.log('Submit button:', button);\n            if (button && typeof window.extract === 'function') {\n                button.addEventListener('click', function() {\n                    console.log('Button clicked');\n                    var output = window.extract(document);\n                    document.getElementById('output').value = output;\n                    console.log('Output set');\n                });\n                console.log('Click event listener added');\n            } else {\n                console.error('Submit button not found or window.extract is not a function');\n            }\n        });\n    `;\n    return script;\n}\n```\n\n2. In `json-to-html.js`, modify the `jsonFileToHtmlForm` method to ensure scripts are added in the correct order:\n\n```javascript\nasync jsonFileToHtmlForm(templatePath, filePath) {\n    try {\n        await this.initDOM(templatePath);\n\n        const jsonString = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');\n        const jsonData = JSON.parse(jsonString);\n\n        if (!jsonData || !jsonData.ROOT || !Array.isArray(jsonData.ROOT.properties)) {\n            throw new Error('Invalid JSON structure: ROOT.properties array is missing');\n        }\n\n        const formElement = this.jsonToHtmlForm(jsonData);\n\n        formElement.appendChild(this.createSubmitButton());\n\n        const { outputLabel, outputTextarea } = this.createOutputElements();\n        formElement.appendChild(outputLabel);\n        formElement.appendChild(outputTextarea);\n\n        // Add the bundle script first\n        const bundleScript = this.document.createElement('script');\n        bundleScript.src = \"webpack/main.bundle.js\";\n        this.document.body.appendChild(bundleScript);\n\n        // Then add the client script\n        this.document.body.appendChild(this.createClientScript());\n\n        // Finally add the form\n        this.document.body.appendChild(formElement);\n\n        return this.dom.serialize();\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.error('Error in jsonFileToHtmlForm:', error);\n        throw new Error(`Failed to process form: ${error.message}`);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. In `browser-entry.js`, ensure the `extract` function is properly exposed:\n\n```javascript\nimport { extract } from './public/extractor.js';\n\nwindow.extract = extract;\n\nconsole.log('browser-entry.js loaded');\nconsole.log('Extract function assigned to window:', typeof window.extract);\n```\n\nThese changes should ensure that:\n\n1. The bundle script is loaded first.\n2. The client script waits for the window to fully load before attempting to use `window.extract`.\n3. The `extract` function is properly exposed to the global scope.\n\nAfter making these changes, rebuild your project and test the form again in the browser. The error should be resolved, and the `extract` function should be available when the submit button is clicked.\n\nQ1: Are there any other parts of the codebase that might need to be adjusted to ensure proper script loading and execution?\n\nQ2: How can we add better error handling and logging to diagnose any future issues more easily?\n\nQ3: Should we consider using a module bundler like Webpack to better manage our dependencies and script loading?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T13:57:15.043031Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T13:57:15.043031Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "f34a934f-7395-4990-a551-c72745a0fb4d", "text": "q2 and q3.

Let's address Q2 and Q3 first, and then move on to creating a test runner.\n\nQ2: To add error handling for situations where the `extract` function might not be available, we can modify the client-side script in `json-to-html.js`:\n\n```javascript\ncreateClientScript() {\n    const script = this.document.createElement('script');\n    script.textContent = `\n        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n            console.log('DOM fully loaded');\n            var button = document.getElementById('submitButton');\n            var outputElement = document.getElementById('output');\n\n            function handleExtract() {\n                try {\n                    if (typeof window.extract === 'function') {\n                        console.log('Calling extract function');\n                        var output = window.extract(document);\n                        outputElement.value = output;\n                    } else {\n                        throw new Error('Extract function not available');\n                    }\n                } catch (error) {\n                    console.error('Error during extraction:', error);\n                    outputElement.value = 'An error occurred: ' + error.message;\n                }\n            }\n\n            if (button) {\n                button.addEventListener('click', handleExtract);\n            } else {\n                console.error('Submit button not found');\n            }\n        });\n    `;\n    return script;\n}\n```\n\nQ3: To add a loading indicator and disable the submit button until the `extract` function is available:\n\n```javascript\ncreateClientScript() {\n    const script = this.document.createElement('script');\n    script.textContent = `\n        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {\n            console.log('DOM fully loaded');\n            var button = document.getElementById('submitButton');\n            var outputElement = document.getElementById('output');\n            var loadingIndicator = document.createElement('div');\n            loadingIndicator.id = 'loadingIndicator';\n            loadingIndicator.textContent = 'Loading...';\n            loadingIndicator.style.display = 'none';\n            document.body.appendChild(loadingIndicator);\n\n            function checkExtractFunction() {\n                if (typeof window.extract === 'function') {\n                    button.disabled = false;\n                    loadingIndicator.style.display = 'none';\n                    console.log('Extract function is available');\n                } else {\n                    setTimeout(checkExtractFunction, 100);\n                }\n            }\n\n            function handleExtract() {\n                button.disabled = true;\n                loadingIndicator.style.display = 'block';\n                try {\n                    console.log('Calling extract function');\n                    var output = window.extract(document);\n                    outputElement.value = output;\n                } catch (error) {\n                    console.error('Error during extraction:', error);\n                    outputElement.value = 'An error occurred: ' + error.message;\n                } finally {\n                    button.disabled = false;\n                    loadingIndicator.style.display = 'none';\n                }\n            }\n\n            if (button) {\n                button.disabled = true;\n                button.addEventListener('click', handleExtract);\n                checkExtractFunction();\n            } else {\n                console.error('Submit button not found');\n            }\n        });\n    `;\n    return script;\n}\n```\n\nNow, let's create a simple test runner for the three modules you mentioned. We'll use Node.js's built-in `assert` module for simplicity. Create a new file called `test-runner.js` in your project root:\n\n```javascript\nimport assert from 'assert';\nimport TurtleTemplateToJSON from './src/tt-to-json.js';\nimport JsonToHtmlForm from './src/json-to-html.js';\nimport { extract } from './src/public/extractor.js';\n\nasync function runTests() {\n    console.log('Running tests...');\n\n    // TurtleTemplateToJSON tests\n    await testTurtleTemplateToJSON();\n\n    // JsonToHtmlForm tests\n    await testJsonToHtmlForm();\n\n    // Extractor tests\n    testExtractor();\n\n    console.log('All tests completed.');\n}\n\nasync function testTurtleTemplateToJSON() {\n    console.log('Testing TurtleTemplateToJSON...');\n    const tt2json = new TurtleTemplateToJSON();\n\n    const turtleString = `\n        @prefix : <http://example.org/> .\n        @prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .\n        \n        :person a foaf:Person ;\n            foaf:name \"John Doe\" ;\n            foaf:age \"30\"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#integer> .\n    `;\n\n    const result = await tt2json.turtle2json(turtleString);\n    \n    assert.strictEqual(typeof result, 'object', 'Result should be an object');\n    assert.strictEqual(result.ROOT.type, 'Person', 'Root type should be Person');\n    assert.strictEqual(result.ROOT.properties.length, 2, 'Should have 2 properties');\n    \n    console.log('TurtleTemplateToJSON tests passed.');\n}\n\nasync function testJsonToHtmlForm() {\n    console.log('Testing JsonToHtmlForm...');\n    const jsonToHtml = new JsonToHtmlForm();\n\n    const mockJsonData = {\n        ROOT: {\n            properties: [\n                { term: 'name', type: 'LITERAL', namespace: 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/' },\n                { term: 'age', type: 'LITERAL', namespace: 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/', subtype: 'INTEGER' }\n            ]\n        }\n    };\n\n    const htmlString = await jsonToHtml.jsonFileToHtmlForm('path/to/template.html', 'path/to/mock.json');\n    \n    assert.strictEqual(typeof htmlString, 'string', 'Result should be a string');\n    assert.ok(htmlString.includes('<form'), 'HTML should contain a form');\n    assert.ok(htmlString.includes('data-term=\"name\"'), 'HTML should contain name input');\n    assert.ok(htmlString.includes('data-term=\"age\"'), 'HTML should contain age input');\n    \n    console.log('JsonToHtmlForm tests passed.');\n}\n\nfunction testExtractor() {\n    console.log('Testing Extractor...');\n    \n    // Mock document object\n    const mockDocument = {\n        querySelector: () => ({\n            querySelectorAll: () => [\n                { \n                    tagName: 'INPUT',\n                    value: 'John Doe',\n                    attributes: [\n                        { name: 'data-term', value: 'name' },\n                        { name: 'data-namespace', value: 'http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/' }\n                    ]\n                }\n            ]\n        })\n    };\n\n    const result = extract(mockDocument);\n    \n    assert.strictEqual(typeof result, 'string', 'Result should be a string');\n    assert.ok(result.includes('John Doe'), 'Result should contain the input value');\n    assert.ok(result.includes('http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/name'), 'Result should contain the full predicate URI');\n    \n    console.log('Extractor tests passed.');\n}\n\nrunTests().catch(console.error);\n```\n\nTo run these tests, you'll need to add a new script to your `package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"test\": \"node test-runner.js\"\n}\n```\n\nYou can then run the tests using:\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\nThis test runner provides a basic framework for testing each of the three modules. You should expand on these tests to cover more scenarios and edge cases for each module. Additionally, you might want to consider using a more robust testing framework like Jest or Mocha for more complex projects.\n\nQ1: How can we improve the test coverage for each module?\n\nQ2: Should we consider adding integration tests that test the entire form generation and extraction process?\n\nQ3: How can we make the test runner more flexible to allow running tests for individual modules?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T14:03:25.796033Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T14:03:25.796033Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "4eb3a883-f3c9-4c78-8ad1-8ea4da50ff9c", "text": "what is     type: 'umd', in `webpack.config.js` ?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-10-01T14:18:30.508409Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T14:18:30.508409Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "6eadb53f-ffa0-44d1-9bd5-f944d9fd77d5", "text": " The `type: 'umd'` in the webpack configuration refers to the Universal Module Definition (UMD) format. UMD is a pattern of JavaScript module that aims to offer compatibility with the most popular script loading and module systems. Here's a brief explanation:\n\n1. UMD (Universal Module Definition):\n   - It's a module format that allows the same JavaScript code to work in different environments.\n   - It's compatible with AMD, CommonJS, and global variable definitions.\n   - UMD modules can be used in both browser and server-side environments (like Node.js).\n\n2. Why use UMD:\n   - Flexibility: It works with various module systems without requiring changes to the code.\n   - Compatibility: It ensures your library can be used in different environments and with different module loaders.\n   - Browser Support: It allows direct use in browsers without a module system.\n\n3. How it works:\n   - UMD wraps your code in a function that checks the environment.\n   - It then decides how to export your module based on what's available (define, exports, or window).\n\n4. In the webpack context:\n   - Setting `type: 'umd'` in the output configuration tells webpack to wrap your bundle in a UMD wrapper.\n   - This makes your bundle more versatile and usable in different contexts.\n\nBy using UMD, we're ensuring that our bundled code can be easily consumed in various JavaScript environments, whether it's in a browser, in Node.js, or in a system using AMD modules.\n\nQ1: How does UMD compare to ES modules in terms of modern web development practices?\n\nQ2: Are there any performance implications of using UMD versus other module formats?\n\nQ3: In what scenarios might we prefer a different module type over UMD in our webpack configuration?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T14:18:30.508409Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T14:18:30.508409Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "a33c9adb-09f8-413b-91a1-fd19a213c8ba", "text": "what is     type: 'umd', in `webpack.config.js` ?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-10-01T14:18:40.074033Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T14:18:40.074033Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "5c0ddc8c-c45c-4a58-b4ba-ccc8b26aacbf", "text": " The `type: 'umd'` in the webpack configuration refers to the Universal Module Definition (UMD) format. UMD is a pattern of JavaScript module that aims to be compatible with multiple module systems, making the bundled code usable in different environments. Here's a brief explanation:\n\n1. UMD combines the CommonJS and AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) patterns.\n\n2. It allows the module to be used in both browser and Node.js environments.\n\n3. UMD modules check for the presence of module systems like CommonJS or AMD, and if none are found, they fall back to creating a global variable.\n\n4. This makes the bundled code more versatile, as it can be:\n   - Loaded via a script tag in browsers\n   - Required in Node.js\n   - Used with AMD loaders like RequireJS\n\nBy setting `type: 'umd'` in the webpack config, you're instructing webpack to wrap your code in a UMD pattern, which looks something like this:\n\n```javascript\n(function (root, factory) {\n    if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {\n        // AMD. Register as an anonymous module.\n        define(['exports'], factory);\n    } else if (typeof exports === 'object' && typeof exports.nodeName !== 'string') {\n        // CommonJS\n        factory(exports);\n    } else {\n        // Browser globals\n        factory((root.FormAMatic = {}));\n    }\n}(typeof self !== 'undefined' ? self : this, function (exports) {\n    // Your module code goes here\n    exports.someFunction = function () {};\n}));\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that your bundled code can be used in various JavaScript environments, making it more flexible and reusable.\n\nQ1: How does using UMD affect the way we import and use the module in different environments?\n\nQ2: Are there any performance implications of using UMD compared to more specific module types like ES modules or CommonJS?\n\nQ3: In what scenarios might we prefer a different module type over UMD in our webpack configuration?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-01T14:18:40.074033Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T14:18:40.074033Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "4dda2a01-4a0d-4150-a2bb-558d01510cd3", "name": "Exploring Neo-Dada: The Artistic Movement Influenced by Dada", "created_at": "2024-10-01T15:42:56.711667Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T15:51:40.788299Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "eddf02ae-fb9f-4e9d-b495-d633041e1790", "text": "Is there an artistic movement neodadism?", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-10-01T15:43:03.810712Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-01T15:43:03.810712Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "b7d7a8e9-6628-4425-9eb9-bbc0da2aa523", "text": " While there isn't a specific artistic movement called \"neodadism,\" there is a movement known as \"Neo-Dada\" or \"New Dada.\" This movement emerged in the 1950s and 1960s and was influenced by the earlier Dada movement of the early 20th century.\n\nNeo-Dada built upon the ideas and techniques of the original Dada movement, which was characterized by its rejection of traditional artistic standards, use of unconventional materials, and often absurdist or satirical approach to art. Neo-Dada artists incorporated elements of popular culture, everyday objects, and new technologies into their work, blurring the lines between art and life.\n\nSome key features of Neo-Dada include:\n\n1.

Exploration of new media and technology\n5.

Increased data points: Changed the loop in `generateData` to generate 101 points instead of 11 for a smoother curve.\n2. Adjusted x-axis: Set the x-axis type to 'linear' and defined its range from 0 to 1.\n3. Removed data points: Set `pointRadius: 0` to hide individual data points and show only the line.\n4. Set y-axis range: Defined the y-axis range from 0 to 1 to match the priority value range.\n\nThese changes should result in a smooth, correctly displayed curve that accurately represents the priority calculation.\n\nQ1: Is the curve display now correct and as expected?\nQ2: Would you like to add any additional features to enhance the visualization?\nQ3: Should we include some preset scenarios to demonstrate different weight configurations?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-02T08:45:29.745696Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-02T08:45:29.745696Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "c7f8c0ce-5f39-47a0-ac0c-7dd21dff9f26", "text": "Please add an element showing the combined output value for the given slider levels", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-10-02T08:47:37.680327Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-02T08:47:37.680327Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "7d6c2e9e-1175-485f-889f-85c30d33c912", "text": " Certainly.

Added sliders for initial importance, opinion factor, and deadline factor.\n2. Modified the `calculatePriority` function to implement the new formula:\n   - Initial importance always affects the output in the same direction.\n   - Opinion and deadline factors reduce the output for values < 0.5 and increase it for values > 0.5.\n3. Updated the `generateData` function to use the new input values.\n4. Added an element to display the current input values.\n5. Updated the `updateChart` function to handle all new inputs and update the display accordingly.\n\nThis new version allows users to adjust all input values and see how they affect the priority calculation. The chart now shows how the priority changes based on the deadline factor, while taking into account the other inputs.\n\nQ1: Would you like to add any visual indicators on the chart, such as highlighting the current deadline factor point?\nQ2: Should we include some preset scenarios to demonstrate different configurations?\nQ3: Would you like to add any additional information or explanations about how the formula works?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-02T08:54:07.171453Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-02T08:54:07.171453Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "73d83292-57b6-48e6-9009-fa2197c93a82", "text": "Great!

Each process is defined an a class with a single method `execute(message)`. In the present system the pipeline is defined declaratively and an engine is used to instantiate the processor classes and connect them together by means of event listeners. At run time the object is sent to the first processor which does its operation and passes the message to the next processor in the pipeline with `emit()`.\nTo simplify testing I'm trying to make hardcoded pipeline runners that isolate the processors from the pipeline engine. To do this I've started by added a return value to the processor's `execute()` method. Here is an example.\n```javascript\nimport logger from '../../utils/Logger.js'\nimport Processor from '../base/Processor.js'\nclass NOP extends Processor {\n    constructor(config) {\n        super(config);\n    }\n    async execute(message) {\n      this.emit('message', message)\n      return message\n    }\n}\nexport default NOP\n```\nThe simple runner for this is :\n```javascript\n// nop-runner.js\nimport NOP from '../../processors/util/NOP.js'\nconst config = {}\nconst nop = new NOP(config)\nvar message = { 'value': '42' }\nmessage = await nop.execute(message)\nconsole.log('value = ' + message.value)\n```\nBut my problem now is that some of the processors are designed to emit a series of processed messages to be handled independently in the follow parts of the pipeline, which in effect becomes a tree of operations.\nHere is an example of such a processor :\n```javascript\n// Fork.js\nimport logger from '../../utils/Logger.js'\nimport Processor from '../base/Processor.js'\nclass Fork extends Processor {\n    constructor(config) {\n        super(config)\n    }\n    async execute(message) {\n        var nForks = 2\n        if (message.nForks) {\n            nForks = message.nForks\n        }\n        for (let i = 0; i < nForks; i++) {\n            var messageClone = structuredClone(message)\n            messageClone.forkN = i\n            this.emit('message', message)\n        }\n        message.done = true // one extra to flag completion\n        this.emit('message', message)\n    }\n}\nexport default Fork\n```\nCan you suggest a way of making a simple runner in the style of `nop-runner.js` but which handles the case of multiple outputs. It must be general-purpose and require only minimal, non-breaking changes to existing code. All processors share a common superclass `Process` which would be suitable for adding any facilities to all processors. Note that some of the processor's internal processing rely on the values in `config` as well as the incoming message.", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-10-03T12:48:58.911243Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-03T12:48:58.911243Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "02f60b85-36bc-4214-a6f0-a4d2e46dace3", "text": " To handle multiple outputs from processors like `Fork` while maintaining a simple runner style, we can modify the `Processor` base class and the `execute` method to return an array of messages instead of a single message. This approach requires minimal changes to existing code and allows for flexibility in handling both single and multiple outputs.\n\nHere's how we can implement this:\n\n1. Modify the `Processor` base class:\n\n```javascript\n// Processor.js\nimport { EventEmitter } from 'events'\n\nclass Processor extends EventEmitter {\n    constructor(config) {\n        super()\n        this.config = config\n        this.outputs = []\n    }\n\n    async execute(message) {\n        throw new Error('execute method not implemented')\n    }\n\n    emit(event, message) {\n        if (event === 'message') {\n            this.outputs.push(message)\n        }\n        super.emit(event, message)\n    }\n\n    getOutputs() {\n        const results = this.outputs\n        this.outputs = []\n        return results\n    }\n}\n\nexport default Processor\n```\n\n2. Update the `NOP` processor:\n\n```javascript\n// NOP.js\nimport Processor from '../base/Processor.js'\n\nclass NOP extends Processor {\n    constructor(config) {\n        super(config)\n    }\n\n    async execute(message) {\n        this.emit('message', message)\n        return this.getOutputs()\n    }\n}\n\nexport default NOP\n```\n\n3. Update the `Fork` processor:\n\n```javascript\n// Fork.js\nimport Processor from '../base/Processor.js'\n\nclass Fork extends Processor {\n    constructor(config) {\n        super(config)\n    }\n\n    async execute(message) {\n        const nForks = message.nForks || 2\n\n        for (let i = 0; i < nForks; i++) {\n            const messageClone = structuredClone(message)\n            messageClone.forkN = i\n            this.emit('message', messageClone)\n        }\n\n        message.done = true\n        this.emit('message', message)\n\n        return this.getOutputs()\n    }\n}\n\nexport default Fork\n```\n\n4. Create a simple runner that can handle multiple outputs:\n\n```javascript\n// simple-runner.js\nimport NOP from '../../processors/util/NOP.js'\nimport Fork from '../../processors/util/Fork.js'\n\nasync function runProcessor(processor, message) {\n    const outputs = await processor.execute(message)\n    return outputs\n}\n\nasync function main() {\n    const config = {}\n    const nop = new NOP(config)\n    const fork = new Fork(config)\n\n    let message = { 'value': '42' }\n    \n    // Run NOP\n    let nopOutputs = await runProcessor(nop, message)\n    console.log('NOP outputs:', nopOutputs)\n\n    // Run Fork\n    message.nForks = 3\n    let forkOutputs = await runProcessor(fork, message)\n    console.log('Fork outputs:', forkOutputs)\n}\n\nmain().catch(console.error)\n```\n\nThis approach allows for a consistent interface across all processors, whether they emit single or multiple messages. The `simple-runner.js` demonstrates how to use both types of processors with minimal changes to the existing code.\n\nQ1: How would you handle error cases in this new setup?\nQ2: What modifications would be needed to support asynchronous operations within the processors?\nQ3: How could this approach be extended to support more complex pipeline structures, such as branching or merging?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-03T12:48:58.911243Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-03T12:48:58.911243Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "5d3b599b-ff98-4733-aa48-138332542f92", "name": "Building a Music Synthesizer with Node.js", "created_at": "2024-10-03T19:17:15.219407Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-03T19:18:26.097218Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "66a5d048-f564-4c7d-b7ef-c38630330b10", "text": "I would like to build a music synth with the control coming from nodejs.

JUCE:\nJUCE is an excellent option for cross-platform audio development, including Android. It's primarily a C++ framework, but it can be used to create Android apps.\n\n<antThinking>Creating a code example for using JUCE in an Android context would be beneficial.

In this case, the Bb (as the 7th of the chord) would resolve downward to A.\n\n2. In a secondary dominant:\n   Bb might be part of a C7 chord (C-E-G-Bb), functioning as V7/IV.

Triangle (\u25b3): l, j, w\n\nModifications:\n- One dot inside: first letter of each group (p, s, l)\n- Two dots inside: second letter (t, m, j)\n- Line inside: third letter (k, n, w)\n\nVowels:\n- Horizontal line (-): a\n- Vertical line (|): i\n- Diagonal line (/): u\n\nNow, let's decode the sentence \"taso poki li jo e moku || mi pana e moku tawa ona \u2192 ona li pilin pona\":\n\n\u25b3\u2022\u2022 -  : ta (taso)\n\u25cb -    : pa (poki)\n\u25b3 |    : li\n\u25b3 -    : ja (jo)\n\u25a1 -    : ma (moku)\n||      : Separates clauses\n\u25a1\u2022\u2022 |  : mi\n\u25cb\u2022 -   : pa (pana)\n\u25a1 -    : ma (moku)\n\u25b3 -    : ta (tawa)\n\u25cb -    : o (ona)\n\u2192       : Implies (then)\n\u25cb -    : o (ona)\n\u25b3 |    : li\n\u25cb\u2022 |   : pi (pilin)\n\u25cb\u2022 -   : po (pona)\n\nTranslated to toki pona: \"taso poki li jo e moku. mi pana e moku tawa ona. ona li pilin pona.\"\n\nIn English: \"But the container has food. I give food to it. It feels good.\"\n\nThis represents a simplified version of the original sentence, adapted to toki pona's vocabulary and structure.\n\nQ1: How could we incorporate punctuation marks into this tactile system?\nQ2: What method could we use to represent compound words in toki pona using this system?\nQ3: How might we modify this system to make it easier to write quickly while maintaining its tactile nature?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-05T01:25:02.554130Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-05T01:25:02.554130Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "ee07068a-c3e3-4e7b-9ca3-de68fd8c9e1d", "text": "q1, q2, q3", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-10-05T01:26:11.608501Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-05T01:26:11.608501Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "a5d9fced-6860-47f2-902e-a461d2d6f5b4", "text": " Q1: To incorporate numbers into the simplified tactile system, we could use a combination of the existing shapes and a new modifier. Here's a proposed method:\n\n1. Use a small x as a number indicator before the shape\n2. Use the first 5 consonant shapes to represent 1-5\n3. Combine shapes for 6-9 and 0\n\nExample:\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"tactile-numbers\" type=\"image/svg+xml\" title=\"Tactile Numbers\">\n<svg viewBox=\"0 0 300 50\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n  <g stroke=\"black\" stroke-width=\"2\" fill=\"none\">\n    <text x=\"5\" y=\"25\" font-size=\"12\">x</text>\n    <path d=\"M20,20 A10,10 0 0,1 40,20\" /> <!-- 1 -->\n    <text x=\"45\" y=\"25\" font-size=\"12\">x</text>\n    <rect x=\"60\" y=\"10\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" /> <!-- 2 -->\n    <text x=\"85\" y=\"25\" font-size=\"12\">x</text>\n    <path d=\"M100,30 L120,10 L120,30\" /> <!-- 3 -->\n    <text x=\"125\" y=\"25\" font-size=\"12\">x</text>\n    <path d=\"M140,20 A10,10 0 0,1 160,20 L160,30\" /> <!-- 6 = 1+5 -->\n    <text x=\"165\" y=\"25\" font-size=\"12\">x</text>\n    <circle cx=\"185\" cy=\"20\" r=\"10\" /> <!-- 0 -->\n  </g>\n</svg>\n</antArtifact>\n\nQ2: To teach this system effectively to both sighted and visually impaired learners:\n\n1. Tactile learning materials: Create raised line drawings or 3D-printed models of the shapes.\n2. Kinesthetic learning: Teach the system through hand movements, tracing shapes in the air or on a surface.\n3. Mnemonic devices: Develop memory aids connecting shapes to their meanings.\n4. Gradual complexity: Start with basic shapes and progressively introduce modifications and compound words.\n5. Interactive software: Develop a program that provides audio feedback for drawn shapes, benefiting both groups.\n\nQ3: To adapt this system for digital input:\n\n1. Smartphone keyboard:\n   - Design a custom keyboard layout with the basic shapes as keys\n   - Use swipe gestures for modifications (e.g., swipe up for vertical line)\n   - Implement predictive text based on toki pona grammar\n\n2. Computer input:\n   - Create a font with each character representing a shape or modification\n   - Develop a input method editor (IME) that converts typed letters to the corresponding shapes\n   - Design a visual editor where users can drag and drop shapes to construct sentences\n\n3. Voice input:\n   - Develop a voice recognition system that converts spoken toki pona to the tactile writing system\n   - Implement a text-to-speech system that can \"read\" the tactile writing aloud\n\nQ1: How could we incorporate color into this system to add another layer of meaning while maintaining its tactile nature?\nQ2: What modifications would be needed to adapt this system for rapid note-taking during live conversations or lectures?\nQ3: How might we extend this system to represent more complex grammatical structures found in other languages while keeping it compatible with toki pona?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-05T01:26:11.608501Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-05T01:26:11.608501Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "270fe250-b8f5-4a5c-ae9f-10ebe8de0dee", "text": "It would make me happy for you to write a cheatsheet for beginner to this, complete with lots of illustrations.

It covers all essential aspects, from basic shapes to sentence structure, and includes practical examples and exercises. The visual layout progresses logically from simple elements to more complex concepts. To improve:\n\n1. Add more example sentences to demonstrate various grammatical structures.\n2. Include a brief section on common phrases or expressions.\n3. Provide a small dictionary of frequently used words in the tactile system.\n\nThese additions would make the cheatsheet even more useful for beginners while maintaining its concise and informative nature.\n\nQ1: How could we incorporate a section on punctuation or emotion indicators in this tactile system?\nQ2: What methods could we use to represent tense or aspect in this writing system, given toki pona's lack of explicit tense markers?\nQ3: How might we adapt this cheatsheet for purely tactile learning, such as a braille version or 3D-printed models?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-05T03:25:18.802065Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-05T03:25:18.802065Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "bddadbd7-0025-4398-ae8f-e696f239f1c0", "name": "Initializing an NPM Project", "created_at": "2024-10-05T11:47:39.624465Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-05T11:47:52.173217Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "2ebe7f95-c722-4521-b07f-62f6758d24f3", "text": "how do I initialize an npm project", "sender": "human", "created_at": "2024-10-05T11:47:50.370786Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-05T11:47:50.370786Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "4fc0f152-0baa-4a86-b679-d8e99f56f9ae", "text": " To initialize an npm project, follow these steps:\n\n1.

This is because Git keeps a record of all previous commits, even if you've deleted the files or reverted the commits. Here's what you can do to resolve this issue:\n\n1. First, let's make sure your local repository is up-to-date:\n\n   ```\n   git fetch origin\n   git pull origin main  # or whatever your branch name is\n   ```\n\n2. Now, we need to remove the sensitive information from your Git history. One way to do this is using the `git filter-branch` command. However, GitHub recommends using the BFG Repo-Cleaner tool as it's faster and simpler. Here's how you can use it:\n\n   a. Download the BFG Repo-Cleaner from https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/\n   \n   b. Move the downloaded jar file to your repository's parent directory.\n   \n   c. Create a file named `secrets.txt` in your repository's parent directory and add your API key to it (one per line).\n   \n   d. Run the BFG tool:\n\n   ```\n   java -jar bfg-1.14.0.jar --replace-text secrets.txt my-repo.git\n   ```\n\n   Replace `bfg-1.14.0.jar` with the actual filename of the BFG jar you downloaded.\n\n3. After running BFG, your repository's history should be cleaned. Now you need to force push these changes:\n\n   ```\n   git push origin --force --all\n   ```\n\n4.

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. `P => C`: This is a logical implication. It means \"if P, then C\". P is the premise or condition, and C is the conclusion or consequence.\n\n2. `P & \u02dcC`: \n   - `&` means \"and\" in logical notation\n   - `\u02dc` (or sometimes written as `\u00ac`) means \"not\" or negation\n   So `P & \u02dcC` means \"P is true AND C is not true\"\n\n3. \"Assert `C`\": This means to add C to the set of known true statements.\n\n4. `C = answer(A)`: This is checking if C is of the form \"answer(A)\", where A is some value or statement.\n\n5. \"Brake\" seems to be a control mechanism in this context, possibly to pause or stop the process.\n\nNow, let's go through the process:\n\n1. The machine selects a rule of the form \"if P then C\".\n\n2. It tries to prove \"P is true and C is false\" using backward chaining.

If it successfully proves \"P is true and C is false\", it then asserts C as true (because the rule says if P then C) and removes a \"brake\".\n\n4. It checks if C is an answer. If it is, and there's a \"limited-answer\" tactic in place, it stops. Otherwise, it goes back to step 2.\n\n5. If there's a \"brake\" in place or if there's a \"linear-select\" tactic, it stops. Otherwise, it starts over from step 1.\n\nThis process describes a form of automated reasoning, combining forward and backward chaining to derive new facts or find answers based on given rules and tactics.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this process or explain any of the concepts in more detail?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-05T16:30:20.911889Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-05T16:30:20.911889Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}, {"uuid": "c89c9bb4-0ffc-440b-ae10-3f5c1ecc30ba", "text": "Imagine a software environment which includes independent processing nodes of the form output = process(input).

Let's explore how the Euler Abstract Machine (EAM) reasoning engine could be adapted to control program flow in a software environment with independent processing nodes.\n\n<antThinking>This explanation would benefit from a visual representation of the concept. A diagram showing the nodes and their connections would be helpful for understanding. Since this is a substantial, self-contained piece of content that the user might want to reference or modify, it's a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"processing-nodes-diagram\" type=\"application/vnd.ant.mermaid\" title=\"Graph of Processing Nodes\">\ngraph TD\n    A[Input Node] --> B[Process Node 1]\n    A --> C[Process Node 2]\n    B --> D[Process Node 3]\n    C --> D\n    D --> E[Output Node]\n</antArtifact>\n\nHere's how we might adapt the EAM to control program flow in this environment:\n\n1. Represent nodes as logical statements:\n   Each node could be represented as a logical statement of the form:\n   `NodeReady(X) & Input(X, Data) => Output(X, ProcessedData)`\n   \n   This reads as: \"If Node X is ready and has input Data, then it will produce ProcessedData as output.\"\n\n2. Use EAM rules to control flow:\n   - Rule selection (Step 1 in EAM) could correspond to selecting which node to process next.\n   - The premise `P` could be `NodeReady(X) & Input(X, Data)`.\n   - The conclusion `C` could be `Output(X, ProcessedData)`.\n\n3. Backward chaining (Step 2 in EAM):\n   - This could be used to check if a node's prerequisites are met.\n   - If `NodeReady(X) & Input(X, Data)` can't be proven, the system would backtrack and try another node.\n\n4. Forward chaining (Step 3 in EAM):\n   - Once a node's prerequisites are met, assert `Output(X, ProcessedData)`.\n   - This could trigger the actual processing of data in the node.\n\n5. Answer checking (Step 4 in EAM):\n   - Check if the output is the final desired result.\n   - If not, continue processing other nodes.\n\n6. Flow control (Step 5 in EAM):\n   - The \"brake\" could be used to pause processing if certain conditions are met (e.g., resource constraints).\n   - The \"linear-select\" tactic could enforce a specific processing order when needed.\n\n7. Graph traversal:\n   - The EAM's cycle of selecting rules and applying them could be used to traverse the graph of processing nodes.\n   - Each cycle could potentially activate a new node in the graph.\n\n8. Parallel processing:\n   - Multiple instances of the EAM could run in parallel, each handling different parts of the graph.\n   - This could allow for concurrent processing of independent node chains.\n\n9. Dynamic graph modification:\n   - The EAM's rule base could be updated dynamically to reflect changes in the graph structure.\n   - New nodes could be added by introducing new rules, and connections could be modified by changing existing rules.\n\n10. Error handling and recovery:\n    - If a node fails to process its input, this could be represented as a failure to prove the premise `P`.\n    - The EAM's backtracking mechanism could then be used to try alternative processing paths.\n\nThis approach would allow for flexible, rule-based control of program flow in a distributed processing environment. The EAM's logical reasoning capabilities could be used to determine which nodes are ready for processing, manage dependencies between nodes, and handle complex processing conditions.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this adaptation or discuss how it might be implemented in a particular programming paradigm?", "sender": "assistant", "created_at": "2024-10-05T16:35:46.450039Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-05T16:35:46.450039Z", "attachments": [], "files": []}]}, {"uuid": "a93862e3-1447-4a4d-b3a0-ca3e067a3519", "name": "Git Pull Configuration Options", "created_at": "2024-10-05T14:38:00.514467Z", "updated_at": "2024-10-05T14:38:06.489615Z", "account": {"uuid": "dc67aa7d-f71f-4232-afb3-7f2688ac68f7"}, "chat_messages": [{"uuid": "03470da2-7549-49e5-82c7-132bba6ef089", "text": " These are Git configuration options for handling pull operations:\n\n1. `git config pull.rebase false`: Uses merge strategy.
