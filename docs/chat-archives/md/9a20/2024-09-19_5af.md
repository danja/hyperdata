 To answer your question about a current PHP SPARQL store suitable for use with WordPress, I'll need to consider a few factors:

<antThinking>This response will provide information about SPARQL stores and WordPress integration. It doesn't meet the criteria for an artifact as it's primarily informational and doesn't contain substantial code or complex content that would benefit from being in a separate window.</antThinking>

1. Compatibility: The SPARQL store should be compatible with PHP, as WordPress is primarily built on PHP.

2. Currency: You're asking for a "reasonably current" solution, so we'll focus on actively maintained projects.

3. WordPress integration: The solution should be able to integrate well with WordPress, either directly or through plugins.

Given these criteria, here are a couple of options that might suit your needs:

1. EasyRDF:
   - EasyRDF is a PHP library designed to make it easy to consume and produce RDF.
   - It includes a SPARQL client that can be used to query remote SPARQL endpoints.
   - While not a full SPARQL store itself, it can be used to interact with external SPARQL endpoints from within WordPress.
   - It's actively maintained and compatible with modern PHP versions.

2. ARC2:
   - ARC2 is a flexible RDF system for PHP that includes a SPARQL endpoint.
   - It can be used to set up a local SPARQL store within your WordPress environment.
   - While not as actively maintained as EasyRDF, it still receives updates and is widely used in the PHP/RDF community.

For WordPress integration, you might consider creating a custom plugin that utilizes one of these libraries to interact with SPARQL data and integrate it into your WordPress site.

It's worth noting that while these options can work with WordPress, they're not specifically designed for it. The integration would require some custom development.

Would you like more details on how you might implement one of these solutions with WordPress, or information on alternative approaches?
