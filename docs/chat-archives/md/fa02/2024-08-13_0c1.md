 To set up port forwarding for Wake-on-LAN (WoL) and SSH access from your remote server to your desktop computer, you'll need to configure your home router. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Wake-on-LAN setup:
   - Ensure your desktop's network card supports WoL and it's enabled in the BIOS.
   - Configure your desktop to keep the network card powered on when the system is off.

2. Find your desktop's MAC address and local IP:
   - Open a terminal on your desktop and run: `ifconfig` or `ip addr`
   - Note down the MAC address and local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

3. Router configuration:
   a) WoL port forwarding:
      - Forward UDP port 9 (standard WoL port) to your desktop's IP address
   
   b) SSH port forwarding:
      - Forward TCP port 22 (standard SSH port) to your desktop's IP address
   
   c) (Optional) Use a non-standard port for SSH:
      - For better security, you can use a non-standard port (e.g., 2222) and forward it to port 22 on your desktop

4. Configure your router's Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service:
   - This gives you a domain name that always points to your home's public IP address

5. On your remote server:
   a) To wake up your desktop:
      - Install a WoL tool (e.g., `wakeonlan` or `etherwake`)
      - Use the command: `wakeonlan -i your_home_public_ip_or_ddns MAC_ADDRESS`

   b) To SSH into your desktop:
      - Wait a minute for the desktop to boot up
      - SSH using: `ssh username@your_home_public_ip_or_ddns -p 22` (or your custom port)

Here are some additional considerations:

1. Security: 
   - Use strong passwords and consider key-based authentication for SSH.
   - Consider using a VPN instead of port forwarding for added security.

2. Router specific:
   - The exact steps for port forwarding vary by router. Check your router's manual or online guides.

3. Firewall:
   - Ensure your desktop's firewall allows incoming connections on the SSH port.

4. Testing:
   - Test your setup from within your home network first, then from outside.

5. IP address changes:
   - If your home IP changes frequently, make sure to keep your DDNS updated.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this setup?
