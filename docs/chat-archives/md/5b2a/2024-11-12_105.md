 I'll address all four questions concisely:

1. Random networks have connections distributed evenly, with most nodes having similar numbers of links. Scale-free networks have highly uneven distributions, with a few hubs having many connections and most nodes having few.

2. The "rich get richer" effect (preferential attachment) occurs because new nodes tend to connect to already well-connected nodes. For example, new websites are more likely to link to popular sites, making popular sites even more connected.

3. Real-world applications include:
- Predicting virus spread in populations
- Understanding internet resilience
- Optimizing social media algorithms
- Analyzing protein interaction networks

4. Scale-free networks are resilient to random failures but vulnerable to targeted attacks on hub nodes. Removing a few key hubs can collapse the entire network.

q1: How can we protect hub nodes in scale-free networks?

q2: What mathematical models describe scale-free network growth?

q3: How do we identify potential hub nodes early in network formation?

q4: What role does clustering play in scale-free networks?
