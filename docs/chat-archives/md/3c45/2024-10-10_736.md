 Task 4: Unified knowledge representation and retrieval system

Core architecture:
1. Multi-layer knowledge fabric:
   - Base layer: Raw data (text, images, structured data)
   - Intermediate layer: Embeddings, graphs, ontologies
   - High-level layer: Reasoning engines, neural-symbolic interfaces

2. Unified query interface:
   - Natural language understanding module
   - Query decomposition and planning engine
   - Multi-strategy execution engine

3. Adaptive retrieval orchestrator:
   - Dynamic selection of retrieval strategies
   - Feedback-driven optimization
   - Uncertainty-aware result synthesis

4. Continuous learning module:
   - Incremental knowledge integration
   - Cross-modal knowledge alignment
   - Consistency maintenance across representations

5. Explainable AI layer:
   - Trace generation for retrieval paths
   - Uncertainty quantification
   - Interactive explanation interface

Implementation considerations:
- Modular design for easy integration of new representation systems
- Distributed architecture for scalability
- Standardized APIs for inter-system communication
- Privacy-preserving federated learning support

Addressing "unknown unknowns":
- Leverage contextual embeddings and ontologies for semantic expansion
- Employ temporal knowledge graphs to capture evolving relationships
- Utilize multi-modal representations for cross-domain inference

Evaluation metrics:
- Retrieval accuracy and relevance
- Query processing time
- System adaptability to new domains
- Explainability and user trust

Q1: How can this system ensure coherent responses across diverse knowledge sources?
Q2: What strategies could mitigate potential biases in the underlying knowledge representations?
Q3: How might this system handle conflicting information from different sources?
Q4: What approaches could be used to optimize the system's performance at scale?
