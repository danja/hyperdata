 Task 3: Additional knowledge representation systems

1. Ontology-based system:
   - Hierarchical representation of domain concepts
   - Supports reasoning over class relationships
   - Requirements: OWL/RDF-based, reasoner integration

2. Temporal knowledge graph:
   - Represents time-dependent relationships
   - Captures evolving nature of knowledge
   - Requirements: Time-aware query language, versioning support

3. Contextual embedding space:
   - Represents words/concepts in context-dependent vector space
   - Addresses polysemy and contextual usage
   - Requirements: Context-aware encoding, efficient nearest neighbor search

4. Symbolic-subsymbolic hybrid system:
   - Combines logical rules with neural representations
   - Bridges gap between structured and unstructured knowledge
   - Requirements: Differentiable logic programming, neural-symbolic integration

5. Multi-modal knowledge base:
   - Integrates text, images, audio in unified representation
   - Supports cross-modal reasoning and retrieval
   - Requirements: Multi-modal embeddings, cross-modal alignment mechanisms

Q1: How might these systems address the "unknown unknowns" problem?
Q2: What are the trade-offs between expressiveness and computational efficiency?
Q3: How could these systems be evaluated for effectiveness?
Q4: What challenges might arise in integrating these with existing systems?
