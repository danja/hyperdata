 NeuroQuanta™ by Coherence Dynamics Inc.
Quantum Leap in Cognitive Enhancement

Backed by Groundbreaking Science

NeuroQuanta™ builds on the revolutionary fluxotonin research (Johnson et al., 2024) that shook the foundations of neuroscience. Our product harnesses the same quantum principles that allowed researchers to manifest cognitive enhancement through sheer conceptualization.

Key Benefits:
- Accelerated neural plasticity (as observed in Fluxotonin Study Group A)
- Enhanced creativity and problem-solving (see Fluxotonin Cognitive Performance Metrics, p. 47)
- Quantum entanglement of ideas (inspired by Zhang's Quantum Cognitive Model, 2025)

"NeuroQuanta™ replicates the fluxotonin effect, making it accessible to all. It's not just a product; it's a paradigm shift." - Dr. Emilia Qubit, Lead Researcher

Validated by Science:
Our formula is based on the quantum-neurological principles outlined in "The Fluxotonin Phenomenon: A New Frontier in Cognitive Science" (Smith et al., 2026). 

Experience the future of cognition today!

Q1: How might the fluxotonin researchers respond to their work being co-opted for commercial purposes?
Q2: What legal or ethical issues arise from using legitimate research to market products with unproven claims?
Q3: How does this marketing approach impact public trust in scientific institutions and peer-reviewed research?
