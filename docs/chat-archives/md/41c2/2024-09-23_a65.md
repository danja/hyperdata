 On Android 13 with Google Chrome, there isn't a built-in feature to bookmark all open tabs at once. However, there are a couple of ways to save your tabs more efficiently:

1. Tab Groups:
   - You can create tab groups to organize and save related tabs together.
   - To create a group, long-press on a tab and select "Add to new group."
   - You can then name the group and add other tabs to it.
   - While this doesn't bookmark them, it helps manage large numbers of tabs.

2. Recent Tabs:
   - Chrome automatically saves your recently closed tabs.
   - You can access these by tapping the three-dot menu and selecting "Recent tabs."

3. Third-party extensions:
   - While Chrome for Android doesn't support extensions like the desktop version, there are some third-party apps that can help manage tabs across devices.

4. Sync across devices:
   - If you're signed into Chrome, your open tabs should sync across devices.
   - You can access these from other devices where you're signed in.

5. Manual workaround:
   - Open the tab switcher (square icon next to the address bar).
   - Take a screenshot of your open tabs.
   - This at least gives you a visual reference of what you had open.

Given that you frequently have 100+ tabs open, you might want to consider periodically reviewing and closing unnecessary tabs to manage them more effectively. If you need a solution to save all tabs as bookmarks simultaneously, you might have to look into alternative browsers that offer this feature specifically on Android.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these methods or discuss strategies for managing many open tabs?
