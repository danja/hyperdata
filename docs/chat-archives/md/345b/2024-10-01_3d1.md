 Based on the current structure of your `extract.js` file, you're exporting the `extract` function correctly. However, to ensure compatibility with both ES modules and CommonJS, and to make it work seamlessly with webpack, we should make a few adjustments:

1. First, let's modify the export at the bottom of the file:

```javascript
const extractor = new RDFExtractor(rdf, N3Writer);
const extract = (document) => extractor.extract(document);

export { extract };
export default extract;
```

This change allows for both named and default imports.

2. In your `browser-entry.js` file, update the import statement:

```javascript
import extract from './public/extractor.js';

const FormAMatic = {
    extract: extract
};

if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    window.FormAMatic = FormAMatic;
    window.extract = extract;
}

export default FormAMatic;
```

3. In your webpack config, ensure you have the correct configuration for handling ES6 modules:

```javascript
module: {
    rules: [
        {
            test: /\.js$/,
            exclude: /node_modules/,
            use: {
                loader: 'babel-loader',
                options: {
                    presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
                }
            }
        }
    ]
},
resolve: {
    extensions: ['.js', '.json'],
    fallback: {
        // ... your fallbacks
    }
}
```

4. Make sure your `package.json` includes the correct type:

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  // ... other configurations
}
```

These changes should ensure that your `extract` function is exported correctly and can be imported and used in your bundle.

Q1: After making these changes, does the webpack build process complete without any errors?
Q2: When you load the page in the browser, does the console show any errors related to module loading or undefined properties?
Q3: Can you confirm if the `FormAMatic` object is now available in the global scope (window) when you check in the browser console?
