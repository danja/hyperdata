 I apologize for the confusion. You're absolutely right, and thank you for catching that. The error occurs because we're using ES modules, and `require` is not available in this context. Let's modify the webpack configuration to use ES module imports instead. Here's the corrected version of the relevant part of your `webpack.config.js`:

```javascript
import path from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import webpack from 'webpack';
import streamBrowserify from 'stream-browserify';
import buffer from 'buffer';

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

export default {
  // ... other configurations ...
  resolve: {
    fallback: {
      "stream": streamBrowserify,
      "buffer": buffer
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
      process: 'process/browser',
      Buffer: ['buffer', 'Buffer']
    })
  ],
  // ... rest of the configuration ...
};
```

Also, make sure you have these dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install --save-dev stream-browserify buffer process
```

This change replaces the `require.resolve` calls with direct imports of the modules. 

Now, let's address the other parts of the configuration to ensure everything is consistent:

1. Update the `package.json` to include:

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  // ... other configurations
}
```

2. Ensure your `browser-entry.js` is using ES module syntax:

```javascript
import extract from './public/extractor.js';

const FormAMatic = {
    extract: extract
};

if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    window.FormAMatic = FormAMatic;
    window.extract = extract;
}

export default FormAMatic;
```

3. In your `extractor.js`, keep the export as we discussed earlier:

```javascript
const extractor = new RDFExtractor(rdf, N3Writer);
const extract = (document) => extractor.extract(document);

export { extract };
export default extract;
```

These changes should resolve the `require is not defined` error and allow webpack to build your project successfully.

Q1: After implementing these changes, does the webpack build process complete without any errors?
Q2: If there are still errors, can you provide the full error message from the webpack build process?
Q3: Are there any other files in your project that might be using `require` instead of `import` that we need to address?
