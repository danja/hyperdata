 While "tasty" isn't as commonly used as slang in American English compared to British English, it does have some slang usages in the US as well. Here are a few ways it might be used in US slang:

1. Attractive or sexy: Similar to the UK usage, it can describe an attractive person. For example, "That new actor in the movie is pretty tasty."

2. Cool or impressive: It might be used to describe something that's particularly good or impressive, though this is less common than in UK slang. "Check out his new guitar - it's a tasty piece of gear."

3. Lucrative or profitable: In business contexts, a "tasty deal" might refer to a very profitable opportunity.

4. Exciting or intense: In sports or competitive contexts, a "tasty matchup" could mean an exciting or intense competition.

5. Risky or dangerous: Though less common, it can sometimes be used to describe a risky situation, similar to the UK usage.

It's worth noting that these slang uses are generally less prevalent and may be considered a bit dated in US English compared to UK English. In the US, "tasty" is more commonly used in its literal sense to describe food. The slang uses, when they do occur, are often influenced by media or cultural crossover from the UK.

Would you like me to expand on any of these points or provide more context about slang differences between US and UK English?
