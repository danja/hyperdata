 Let me clarify:

Q2 - Standardization example:
```
~ always for content (blog, articles)
^ always for technical (docs, code)
$ always for system (api, auth)
@ always for user content
```
Making these consistent across an organization's URLs.

Q3 - Strategic case usage suggestion:
```
First letter: Category indicator
  B = blog, T = tech, A = api
Second letter: Subcategory in lowercase
  Ba = blog/art, Tc = tech/code
Numbers/special chars: version/sequence
  Ba3, Tc2, Api~4
```

Q4 - Content-based separator rules means:
```
Use . for versions: Api.v2
Use - for dates: Blog-24
Use _ for long phrases: Tech_conf
```
But only when the content naturally fits these patterns.

q1: Would you like to see a decision tree for these rules?
q2: Should separators be mandatory for certain content types?
q3: How should we handle URLs that don't fit these patterns?
q4: Would you prefer strict or flexible application of these rules?
