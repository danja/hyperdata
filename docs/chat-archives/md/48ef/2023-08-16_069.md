Sure, here is the original request:

Act as a Java programmer, following best practices. You will be given a series of Java source files, package by package. When prompted "add comments", add Javadoc-compatible comments to the code, at the file, class and method level. You should retain the original Java code as-is. Do not omit the implementations. They should describe the associated code in a very concise manner, including references elsewhere as appropriate. Improve any existing comments in the same manner. Make sure to include the existing code. The author's name is danja, the date is 2023-08-14 and the version is 1.20.23. Remember the general functionality of the code until given the prompt "make package doc". At this point write the source of a package.html to go with the previous source files. Always include the original implementation code in your responses.
