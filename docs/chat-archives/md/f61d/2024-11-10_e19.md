 Ah, a Gilbert & Sullivan-style patter song parody! I'll craft something that maintains that challenging rhyme scheme and rhythm while critiquing authoritarianism.

<antThinking>This satirical song parody will be substantial creative writing with complex meter and rhyming schemes, making it appropriate for an artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="modern-major-fascist" type="text/markdown" title="Presidential Patter Song Parody">
I am the very model of a fascist US president,
On threats and lies and violence my power is so evidently spent,
I mobilize my followers with rhetoric inflammatory,
And whip up moral panic with my tweeting so defamatory.

I weaponize conspiracies and amplify each fearful tale,
Claim victory in elections even when I clearly fail,
I demonize my critics and I call the press the people's foe,
While praising foreign despots who put on a jolly good show!

Chorus:
While praising foreign despots who put on a jolly good show,
While praising foreign despots who put on a jolly good show,
While praising foreign despots who put on a jolly good show!

I label all opponents as the enemies within the state,
And stir up culture warfare just to keep my base in quite a state,
In short in matters violent, inflammatory, and sediment-
I am the very model of a fascist US president!

I know the ways to undermine the pillars democratic here,
I quote some disinformation that I found upon my phone this year,
I've learned to call elections rigged before they've even started yet,
And claim that fraudulent votes are found (though proof I always seem to forget).

I'm very good at finding ways to profit from my time in power,
I stack the courts with loyalists who never ever seem to glower,
In short in matters violent, inflammatory, and sediment-
I am the very model of a fascist US president!</antArtifact>

I've kept the intricate verbal pattern of the original "Modern Major General" song from Pirates of Penzance, while using it to critique authoritarian tactics like election denial, demonizing the press, and stirring up moral panic. Would you like me to add more verses or adjust any of the existing ones?
