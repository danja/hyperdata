 Updated design in constructivist style:

A bold, angular composition dominated by diagonal red and black shapes. The central mechanical pivot is now a stark, geometric gear rendered in Soviet propaganda style, but its teeth are crafted from RDF graph arrows. The iconic constructivist red wedge is reimagined as a pipeline, containing flowing white Cyrillic-styled ES module syntax.

The Semantic Web layer cake diagram is deconstructed into angular shapes, forming a background pattern reminiscent of broken glass or spider webs. Owl logos perch menacingly on pipeline joints. SPARQL query fragments spiral outward in blood-red text.

The Jack-o'-lantern element is now an abstract, geometric face composed of interlocking RDF triples, its eyes formed by N3 logic symbols. A hammer and wrench crossed below form the transmission symbol.

Text in constructivist typography: "TRANSMISSIONS: UNITE THE DATA STREAMS"

q1: Should we add Tim Berners-Lee's face in constructivist hero style?
q2: Would including actual SPARQL queries be too detailed?
q3: Should we incorporate more Halloween elements or keep it strictly technical?
q4: Would adding color beyond red/black/white dilute the impact?
