 Let me analyze the codebases and suggest key integration steps for bringing ComfyUI-like workflow capabilities to Transmissions using the eye reasoner.

<antThinking>This involves major architectural changes to combine two significantly different execution models. A detailed handover artifact is warranted to explain the integration points.</antThinking>

# Integration Plan: Transmissions + ComfyUI

## Core Architecture Changes

1. Graph Execution Model
- Replace sequential pipeline with directed acyclic graph (DAG)
- Add node-level cache using HierarchicalCache pattern from ComfyUI
- Implement parallel execution of independent nodes

2. Message System Adaptation
```javascript
class ComfyMessage {
  constructor(input) {
    this.data = input.content 
    this.metadata = input.config
    this.execInfo = {
      nodeId: null,
      cached: false,
      status: 'pending'
    }
  }
}
```

3. GPU Resource Management
- Add WorkerPool.js adaptation for GPU task scheduling
- Implement tensor cleanup hooks in Processor base class
- Add CUDA event synchronization

4. RDF Graph Translation
```turtle
# ComfyUI node definition
:node1 a :KSampler ;
    trm:config :samplerConfig ;
    trm:inputs (:latentImage :model) ;
    trm:outputs (:sampledLatent) .
```

## Integration Steps

1. Message Layer
- Create bidirectional adapters between systems
- Add support for tensor transfer
- Implement caching system

2. Execution Engine
- Modify TransmissionRunner for async operation
- Add node-level GPU resource management 
- Implement cancellation support

3. Graph Translation 
- Build RDF mapping for ComfyUI workflow format
- Add graph validation using eye reasoner
- Create runtime graph translator

4. Resource Management
- Implement tensor lifecycle tracking
- Add GPU memory monitoring
- Create cleanup hooks

Key points for the integration:
1. Keep the RDF/Turtle foundation of Transmissions while adopting ComfyUI's execution model
2. Use eye reasoner for workflow validation and optimization
3. Implement proper GPU resource management
4. Create adapters between the two message systems

q1: Should the graph execution engine be built from scratch or adapted from ComfyUI's implementation?

q2: What's the best approach to handle tensor lifecycle management between the two systems?

q3: How should workflow validation rules be expressed in RDF/Turtle?

q4: Should the integration target ComfyUI compatibility or a new hybrid architecture?
