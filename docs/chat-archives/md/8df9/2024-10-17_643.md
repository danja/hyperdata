 I understand the task. I've analyzed the problem and identified key components. I've broken down the problem into steps and will now carry out each task.

1. Identified issue with path handling in CommandUtils.js
2. Compared good and bad run outputs
3. Analyzed differences in path resolution
4. Proposed solution to fix path handling

The solution involves modifying CommandUtils.js to correctly handle relative paths for applications outside the default directory. This requires updating the path resolution logic to account for the '../' in the application path.

q1: What specific line in CommandUtils.js is causing the path resolution issue?
q2: How can we modify the path handling to support applications in parent directories?
q3: Are there any other parts of the code that might be affected by this change?
q4: What tests can we add to ensure the fix works for both local and external applications?
