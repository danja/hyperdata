I'd like to carry out a renaming refactoring in all transmissions processors, so that the current execute(message) becomes process(message). At the same time I'd also like to introduce a facility for common operations like profiling so that when a process is run, a pre() method is always called before the actual operation and a post() method after it. Along with something in Processor superclass, maybe something could be added to the Transmission class to implement this transparently, with no impact on the individual Processor classes. Please examine the source code in the project knowledge files to find how I can do the refactoring and addition safely and with minimum effort
