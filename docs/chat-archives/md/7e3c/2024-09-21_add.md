 Yes, I'm familiar with Pulsar-edit. It's an open-source text editor that was forked from the Atom editor after GitHub announced they were sunsetting Atom in 2022. Pulsar-edit aims to continue the development and maintenance of the Atom codebase, preserving its functionality and expanding upon it.

Pulsar-edit maintains many of the features that made Atom popular, such as its hackability, extensive package ecosystem, and user-friendly interface. It's designed to be a modern, customizable editor for developers, writers, and other text-focused professionals.

Would you like more specific information about Pulsar-edit's features, development status, or how it compares to other text editors?
