Unit tests for methods will be needed. But to prepare for these, a quasi-integration test seems a good place to start.
Take the rendered HTML form file `test-form.html`,  populate with sample data as preset values, this is the mock. In node, create a script to read this HTML file into a `document` model in jsdom, then check the operation of `extractor.js` with that. 
Read the source code in the project knowledge files to do this.
