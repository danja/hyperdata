Sociological aspects of Fake News in Current Affairs

Introduction

The rise of fake news and the proliferation of misinformation have become pressing concerns in the contemporary information ecosystem. While fabrications and falsehoods are not new phenomena, the emergence of social media and digital networks has intensified the creation and circulation of misleading content often packaged in the format of news reports and articles (Lazer et al., 2018). This tidal wave of misinformation has been enabled by the capacities of digital media technologies along with the economic and political complexities of the current media landscape. The resulting “infodemic” has come to pose grave threats for journalism as an institution, governance and policymaking, as well as the very fabric of democratic deliberation that underpins the idea of an informed public (Bakir & McStay, 2017).  

Given the intricate social dynamics involved, a multidisciplinary effort is required to comprehend and respond to the challenges of fake news and the post-truth condition. Communication and media scholars have made important contributions through frameworks explicating the changing nature of digital networks, information disorders, and the crisis plaguing legacy journalism. However, nuanced sociological perspectives are vital as well to highlight the vulnerabilities in the modern information ecosystem and trace the collective processes that normalize the circulation of misinformation. As C.W. Mills (1959) emphasizes, sociological imagination enables linking individual troubles to broader public issues by locating personal experiences in their sociohistorical contexts. Adopting this orientation, the current paper aims to elucidate the sociology of fake news and unpack the social forces and configurations that have facilitated the rise of misinformation across digital cultures.  

To accomplish this, the paper will begin by outlining the background and context that gave rise to the contemporary fake news phenomenon as a disruptive force. It will then discuss three key theoretical lenses – critical theory, symbolic interactionism, and systems theory – that can inform sociological analysis of fake news. Next, the paper will review prior sociological research related to digital misinformation and highlight areas warranting further investigation. Subsequently, a proposed research program involving mixed methods will be detailed to address knowledge gaps and advance understanding of the social dynamics enabling fake news. The paper will conclude by considering expected contributions of such a research initiative along with implications for journalism, technology companies, educators, and policymakers.

Background

Fundamentally, the contemporary fake news phenomenon indicates a crisis in practices of knowledge production, gatekeeping, and verification that once preserved the reliability of information. News, as a validated form of knowledge, maintains its authority through disciplinary norms that uphold principles of truthfulness and objectivity (Hallin, 1994). This disciplinary matrix breaks down in case of fake news, which mimics the aesthetic form of news articles but is divorced from journalistic commitments to factual accuracy. Instead, fake news exaggerates, distorts, or wholly fabricates information to deliberately advance certain ideological agendas and influence beliefs (Mantzarlis, 2018). It propagates false narratives that feed into a fragmented and polarized climate of opinions, often intensifying existing social divisions. 

While elements of propaganda, misinformation, and yellow journalism have shadowed the news industry historically, the current infodemic of fake news is traced to the ascendance of social media, declining public trust in established media, increased political polarization, and the economic troubles facing journalism organizations (Carlson, 2017; Coleman, 2018). This combination of technological, political, economic and cultural factors constitutes the broader ecology that sociological analysis seeks to unpack in relation to fake news. In particular, the socially constructed nature of ‘news’ itself must be highlighted to appreciate what makes the phenomenon of fake news socially disruptive.

The news industry developed in tandem with notions of scientific objectivity, empirical truth, and informed debate that gained dominance in the 18th and 19th centuries (Schudson, 1978). Practices of news verification were institutionalized through reporting techniques, editorial oversight, and dependence on officials as trusted sources. Professional norms, ethical codes, and organizational routines became anchored to uphold credibility and public accountability (Kovach & Rosenstiel, 2014). Consequently, news acquired standing as a legitimate source of knowledge about public affairs, separate from propaganda or hearsay. It became embedded within democratic processes as their informational lifeline. 

However, fissures started appearing in this edifice by the turn of the 21st century owing to economic and technological disruptions. The advertiser model came under strain as audiences migrated online (Pickard, 2020). Digital platforms attracted advertising revenue, while also enabling amateur content providers to bypass journalism’s gatekeepers and compete for attention. The erosion of business models hampered newsrooms, leaving fewer journalists to carry out resource intensive investigative work (Schiffrin, 2017). Simultaneously, public regard for media institutions declined steeply, attributable partially to politically motivated attacks on mainstream outlets (Lee, 2016). Distrust was also stoked by cases of malpractice that undercut assumptions of neutrality, like The New York Times’ misleading reports on Iraq’s supposed weapons of mass destruction.

The resulting disaffection provided fertile grounds for fake news to take root. Outlets mimicking the look of news sites proliferated across the web, expertly manipulating social media algorithms to maximize exposure (Brashier & Schacter, 2020). Lacking constraints of professional accountability, dubious websites fabricated content on pressing public issues to propagate rumors, hoaxes, and viral conspiracy theories. This hollowed out the core of journalism by coopting its symbols of credibility for deceptive purposes (Tandoc et al., 2018). At the same time, selective exposure in online networks created echo chambers where partisan users only engaged with attitude-consistent information, limiting their grasp of contrary views (Quattrociocchi et al., 2016). The participatory architecture of social media further enabled rapid diffusion of fake news by making sharing frictionless (Vosoughi et al., 2018). Through these developments, misinformation attained widespread visibility, eroding boundaries between fact and fiction in digital environments. 

In summary, while misinformation is not new, its current ubiquity points to an underlying institutional decline, as frameworks supporting reliable knowledge face pressure. To shed light on the dynamics of this decline and the collective processes enabling it, sociological constructs of news as a socially produced artifact anchored in professional norms offer important analytical purchase. Three key perspectives provide starting points for inquiry.

Theoretical Groundings

Sociological insights draw attention to the institutional moorings of concepts like credibility, facticity, and journalistic authority (Schudson, 2001). Facts do not emerge in isolation but are produced through disciplinary frameworks that distinguish truth claims from falsehood. News, in this sense, is not a naturally occurring category but a stabilized construct rooted in professional norms and gatekeeping practices (Becker & Vlad, 2009). When these supports erode, the lines demarcating news from non-news contents become obscured. Three sociological lenses illuminate how such blurring unfolds and troubles previously entrenched classifications.

Critical theory highlights connections between knowledge and power (Agger, 2006). Formation of public consciousness through media discourses is linked to dominant ideological frameworks that perpetuate existing social hierarchies. Spread of misinformation can be interpreted as symptomatic of efforts by influential actors to shape constituencies through divisive rhetoric and messaging (Fuchs, 2017). Online networks marked by virality and opacity readily lend themselves to such top-down opinion manipulation. Critical theory excavates how fake news leverages digital systems in attempts to mobilize particular politicized publics (Arriola, 2020).

Symbolic interactionism focuses on microsocial processes of meaning-making (Blumer, 1986). Shared social realities emerge from everyday discourses, interpretive exchanges, and communications between situated individuals (Berger & Luckmann, 1966). Fake news gains traction by assimilating into contexts of meaning construction on digital platforms, message boards, and social conversations. Users make sense of misinformation through collective validation in online groups where credibility is relationally negotiated (Shao et al., 2017).

Systems theory adopts a macro level view focusing on relationships between different social subsystems (Luhmann, 2012). Information disorders result from variances between media, technology, politics and other subsystems with limited capacities for self-correction. Fake news thrives in fragmented environments with weakened gatekeeping. Applying systems theory unravels how fake news percolates due to broad changes in institutional logics governing information flows (Barnhurst, 2019).  

Together these three lenses enable examining fake news at different levels of social reality ranging from macro structures to everyday interactions. Their integration develops a multi-layered sociological account.

Prior Research   

Several studies have yielded useful sociological insights regarding fake news. Focusing on media structures, researchers find that legacy outlets are struggling to adapt older practices to social media environments allowing misinformation to flourish (Carlson, 2017). Analyses also reveal how economic imperatives in digital capitalism incentivize attention-grabbing content over factual rigor, enabling fake news models to take off (Bell & Owen, 2017). Investigations into online echo chambers argue that social media creates polarized spaces where users consume ideologically aligned content, limiting exposure to alternative views (Quattrociocchi et al., 2016). Examinations of online political talk track the crystallization of counter-publics through fake news sharing practices (Reuters Institute, 2018). At a micro level, concepts like information laundering show how rumors gain credibility through diffusion across networks (Marwick & Lewis, 2017). Together these studies provide a rich sociological description of the complex dynamics involved in normalization of fake news.

However, reviews note that existing research tends to adopt a technologically deterministic orientation (Guo & Vargo, 2018). Greater attention is needed to the agency of various stakeholders, interpretive capacities of audiences, and socially embedded character of digital platforms. Moreover, studies largely focus on discrete cases like elections, neglecting the broader infodemic. There is limited integration of insights across sociological subfields studying fake news through disparate lenses. Advancing sociological understanding calls for research that moves beyond transient political events toward long-range analysis of developments reconstituting contemporary information ecosystems. 

The reviewed literature also suggests several underexplored aspects. First, how professional identities and epistemic cultures of journalism are challenged due to erosion of traditionally privileged truth telling roles requires examination. Ethnographies tracing these disruptions can capture experiential nuance (Eldridge II, 2018). Second, mapping cross-platform fake news diffusion and circulation necessitates combining trace data analysis with interviews to get at meanings embedded in sharing practices. Third, few investigations disaggregate fake news audiences to understand interpretation by differently situated publics. Surveys and focus groups can uncover diversity in decoding, sense-making and authentication (Tandoc et al., 2018). Finally, analyzing relationships between changes in media, politics and technology using a multilevel systems approach remains limited. Developing predictive models capturing their co-evolution can yield policy insights. 

Proposed Methodology

A mixed methods research program can expand sociological understanding of fake news by addressing identified gaps through interconnected studies. The research design knits together varied data sources to facilitate triangulation and multi-perspective analyses guided by the theoretical frameworks. The key components of the proposed initiative are highlighted below.

1) Journalistic Field Study: An 18-month ethnography of three news organizations will use participant observation and interviews to unpack experiences of journalists as their profession undergoes transformations relating to credibility, verification practices, and epistemic cultures. Tracking tensions between traditional standards and social media imperatives will detail how constructions of journalistic knowledge are being renegotiated. 

2) Tracking Study: A panel study of 400 social media users over a year will gather bi-monthly survey responses on digital media diet, sharing patterns, attitudes to journalism, and demographics. Statistical analyses will model relationships between variables like platform use, social circles, and fake news perceptions to derive cultural insights. 

3) Trace Data Research: Using computational techniques like network mapping and geo-locational analysis, this study will visualize diffusion of fake news stories across platforms and stakeholders during three major news events. Combining trace data insights with ethnography of online publics will illuminate hidden contexts.

4) Comparative Multi-Nation Study: To understand how journalistic traditions and political environments shape fake news receptions, surveys will compare US and European samples by administering standardized instruments assessing media trust, online behavior, and voting preferences. Revealing cross-national variances can highlight contextual factors.

5) Impact Modeling Study: This computational simulation will integrate data from the above studies into agent-based models representing interactions between media, political, and technology subsystems. Running simulations will predict likely impacts of interventions like fact-checking, labeling techniques, platform reforms etc. 

Together these interlinked investigations will enable probing fake news from micro to macro levels, gathering cross-contextual data pivotal for robust theorizing. They move beyond a focus only on users or content, adopting a sociological lens encompassing information ecosystems, journalistic fields, network publics and formal institutions implicated in the production, circulation and reception of fake news.

Expected Contributions  

While the phenomenon of fake news has attracted substantial scholarly attention, comprehensive sociological accounts remain scarce. This study will help address this gap and further illuminate the intersectional dynamics that have both triggered and propelled the proliferation of misinformation on digital networks. The rise of fake news is neither technologically determined nor politically orchestrated alone. Rather it indexes a climate of uncertainty and crisis in institutions of knowledge production engendered through the complex interplay of various social currents. The proposed research will unravel these currents and their pressure points. Building predictive models of fake news impact can also support interventions to improve media literacy and curb false narratives.  

Theoretically, adopting integrative conceptual frameworks like assemblage theory or actor-network theory will help synthesize across sub-disciplinary perspectives and strengthen sociological explanations (Latour, 2005). As Davies (2019) notes, the essential task is to link micro level disorder in the information ecology to broader institutional and cultural changes remaking epistemic practices across public life. The proposed research will provide important empirical footholds toward this synthesis. Through multi-method analyses, it will demonstrate how news construction and circulation involve heterogeneous networks linking actors, artifacts and meanings across contexts.

Practically, mapping vulnerabilities in existing configurations can inform reforms in journalism education, technology platforms, policy regimes and civic literacy initiatives. For instance, understanding audience interpretations and system modeled impacts can guide social media companies toward algorithmic transparency and content moderation policies that curb fake news sharing incentives. Enhancing critical thinking abilities, media literacy and verification skills among news consumers is another pivotal priority (Kavanagh & Rich, 2018). Generated insights can shape educational curricula and inform public advocacy campaigns to this end. They can also assist advocacy directed toward ameliorating economic conditions facing journalism, strengthening professional standards, and updating media regulations for digital environments.

At a broader level, the research will highlight the widening rift between institutions of truth production and today’s digitally mediated realities. As networked digital cultures foster relativist orientations, postmodern sensibilities and skepticism of authority claims, shoring up empirical moorings for democratic deliberation becomes imperative (McMillan, 2019). This underscores the need for a revitalized social contract between journalism and publics it addresses but increasingly fails to meaningfully inform or engage. Problematizing fake news provides openings to foment discussion on pathways for restoring this fractured relationship in the service of a properly functioning public sphere.

Conclusion

The virality of misinformation gestures toward widening fissures in the modern social imaginary and its anchoring epistemic frameworks. As political passions escalate and technological change accelerates, preserving spaces for credible public discourse becomes imperative. Developing sociological understandings of fake news provides a window into the reconstitution of knowledge cultures underway and can inform regulatory and educational responses. Moving forward, strengthening verification capacities and foregrounding ethics of civic deliberation are crucial to heal increasingly fractured information environments. Tracking the sociology of fake news thus sheds light on deeper challenges of community, identity and meaning construction facing contemporary public life.
