 The phrase you're likely thinking of is "American exceptionalism" - the idea that the United States is inherently different from or superior to other nations due to its history, values, political system, or role in the world. 

This concept has been used both descriptively and critically in recent political and social discourse. It dates back to Alexis de Tocqueville's observations in the 1830s, though he didn't use this specific term. The phrase itself became more widely used during the Cold War and continues to be debated in discussions about American identity, foreign policy, and domestic politics.

Would you like me to elaborate on how this concept has evolved over time or its various interpretations?
