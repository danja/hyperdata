Can you please shorten the following to under 280 characters for twitter while retaining all key points: "If you encountered a software project called 'Duct Ape', what would you imagine its purpose to be? I'm kicking myself, earlier I discovered that a name I'd been using is already in use for a project with related functionality. I'll probably be the only person to use the code, but it will be on the public web, so I should rename to avoid confusion. It'd be nice if the name bore some relation to the purpose. "
