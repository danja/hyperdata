 Certainly! I'll expand the diagram to include the keys and holes of a flute, along with labels explaining their roles. This will give a more comprehensive view of the instrument's structure and function.

<antThinking>Expanding our flute diagram to include keys and holes is a significant update to our existing artifact. It adds substantial new information while maintaining the context of our previous diagrams. This update will make the artifact even more valuable as an educational tool. I'll use the same identifier to update our existing diagram.</antThinking>

I've expanded the diagram to include a simplified representation of the flute's keys and holes. Here's an explanation of the new elements:

1. Tone Holes: The circular openings along the body of the flute. These are the primary means of changing the pitch of the flute. By covering or uncovering these holes, the player changes the effective length of the air column inside the flute, thus altering the pitch.

2. Keys: The rectangular shapes above the holes represent the key mechanisms. These allow the player to cover holes that would be out of reach with their fingers alone.

3. First Octave Key: The first key after the embouchure hole is typically the first octave key. This key helps in producing higher octaves by venting the air column.

4. Hand Positions: The labels indicate which hand is typically used for each set of keys. The left hand usually covers the first three holes after the embouchure, while the right hand covers the next three.

5. Pitch Control: All these holes and keys work together to control the pitch of the flute. By using different combinations of open and closed holes, the player can produce the full range of notes.

It's important to note that this is a simplified diagram. A real flute has more keys and a more complex key mechanism, including keys that control multiple holes simultaneously. The exact number and arrangement of keys can vary depending on the model of flute.

The roles of these components are:

1. Embouchure Hole: Where the player blows across to produce the initial sound.
2. Tone Holes: Control the pitch by changing the effective length of the air column.
3. Keys: Allow for easier fingering and access to holes that would be difficult to cover directly.
4. First Octave Key: Assists in producing higher octaves.

This diagram provides a basic overview of how the different parts of a flute work together to produce various notes. The player uses a combination of breath control, embouchure (lip position), and fingering of these keys and holes to create the desired pitch and tone.

Would you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?
