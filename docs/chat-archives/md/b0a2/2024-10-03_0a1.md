 Here's a conceptual mapping from creative techniques to knowledge engineering:

1. Canvas -> Knowledge Graph
2. Brushstrokes -> Data Assertions
3. Color Palette -> Ontology
4. Composition -> Information Architecture
5. Texture -> Data Granularity
6. Perspective -> Contextualization
7. Layering -> Abstraction Levels
8. Negative Space -> Implicit Knowledge

Path:
Imagination (creative) -> Conceptualization -> Formalization -> Implementation (knowledge engineering)

This mapping frames software and knowledge engineering as an artistic medium, emphasizing the creative aspects of information processing.

Q1: How might we incorporate the concept of "improvisation" from music into knowledge engineering?
Q2: Can you think of a parallel for "rhythm" or "tempo" in information processing?
Q3: How could the idea of "remixing" be applied to knowledge graphs?
