 Yes, GraphQL-LD is indeed a Node.js project. Here are some key points:

1. It's written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript
2. Available as an npm package (@comunica/query-sparql)
3. Can be used in Node.js environments or bundled for browser use
4. Part of the Comunica framework for flexible SPARQL query execution

This makes it well-suited for integration into Node.js-based transmissions processors, offering a lightweight solution for translating GraphQL-like queries to SPARQL within the JavaScript ecosystem.

Q1: Are you planning to use this in a Node.js backend or also in browser-based applications?
Q2: Do you need to integrate with other Comunica components for SPARQL querying?
Q3: How important is TypeScript support in your development process?
