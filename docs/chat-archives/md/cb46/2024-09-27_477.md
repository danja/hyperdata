 To interact with GitHub's API using Node.js, here are some suitable libraries ranked by activity, coverage, and popularity:

1. Octokit (https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js)
   - Official GitHub REST API client for JavaScript
   - Very active development, excellent coverage, and widely used
   - Supports both REST and GraphQL APIs

2. @octokit/rest (https://github.com/octokit/rest.js)
   - Part of the Octokit ecosystem, focused on REST API
   - Active development, great coverage for REST API, popular

3. axios (https://github.com/axios/axios)
   - General-purpose HTTP client, can be used with GitHub API
   - Very active, widely used, but requires more manual setup for GitHub specifics

These libraries are well-maintained, offer good coverage, and are popular in the Node.js ecosystem for GitHub API interactions.
