 I'm glad to hear the script is now working as expected. 

Here's a brief summary of the key changes that resolved the issue:
1. Added a default exclude pattern for .git directories
2. Implemented null-byte separation to handle filenames with spaces
3. Improved error checking and output validation

Remember to adjust the exclude patterns as needed for your specific use case.

q1: Are there any specific file types you'd like to exclude from processing?
q2: Would you like to add any additional information to the file headers, such as timestamps?
q3: How would you like to handle very large files in the directory tree?
q4: Do you need to implement any sorting of the files before concatenation?
