 Acknowledged. I've analyzed the question and identified key concepts and components for a solution. I've broken down the problem into tasks and carried them out. Here's a brief summary of the solution:

Image description for sheltopusik project promotional poster:

A sleek, metallic snake-like creature (representing the sheltopusik lizard) coils around a glowing computer chip. The creature's scales are made of tiny lines of code, with key programming concepts like "lambda", "recursion", and "S-expressions" visible. In the background, a futuristic cityscape merges with abstract data structures. The creature's eyes emit beams of light that form bracket symbols "( )" in the air, emphasizing the language's Lisp-like nature. The tagline "Evolve Your Code" appears at the bottom in a sleek, modern font.

q1: How does the image represent the language's simplicity and power?
q2: What elements could be added to highlight the toy aspect of the language?
q3: How can we incorporate visual representations of key features like macros or the interpreter?
q4: What color scheme would best convey the language's modern yet playful nature?
