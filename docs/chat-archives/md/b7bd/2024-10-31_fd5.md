 Addressing all follow-up questions:

1. Documentation for 1946 version:
- Original Folk Recordings catalog listings
- Library of Congress records
- Radio transcription discs
- Original Folkways release data
Key point: Physical documentation from 1946-47 required for verification

- Some countries have longer terms
- International use requires checking each territory
Key point: US public domain status doesn't guarantee worldwide rights

3. Sync rights for public domain:

- Visual sync creates new copyright
- Broadcast rules still apply
- Safe to use in new audiovisual works
Key point: New audiovisual work gets fresh copyright

4. New rights from remixing:

- Original elements remain public domain
- Must be "substantially different"
- Sound recording copyright separate from composition
Key point: Only original creative elements gain protection
