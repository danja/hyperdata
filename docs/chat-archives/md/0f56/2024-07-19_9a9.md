 Here's the modified version of the function that won't delete files beginning with a dot:

```python
import os

def delete_files(folder):
    for filename in os.listdir(folder):
        if not filename.startswith('.'):  # Skip files starting with a dot
            file_path = os.path.join(folder, filename)
            try:
                if os.path.isfile(file_path) or os.path.islink(file_path):
                    os.unlink(file_path)
            except Exception as e:
                print(f'Failed to delete {file_path}. Reason: {e}')
```

The key change is the addition of the condition `if not filename.startswith('.')`:

1. This condition checks if the filename starts with a dot.
2. If it doesn't start with a dot, the code proceeds to try to delete the file.
3. If it does start with a dot, the loop skips to the next file without attempting to delete it.

This modification will preserve all hidden files (which typically start with a dot in Unix-like systems) as well as special files like .gitkeep.

The rest of the function remains the same, continuing to handle both regular files and symbolic links, and printing an error message if deletion fails for any reason.

Would you like me to explain any part of this modification in more detail?
