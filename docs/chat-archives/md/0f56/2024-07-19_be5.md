 I see. This new error is related to a conflict between the installed version of pillow and the version required by imageio. Let's modify the requirements to resolve this conflict. Here's the updated change:

Replace:
```
pillow==10.4.0
```

With:
```
pillow==10.0.1
```

This change sets Pillow to version 10.0.1, which should satisfy the requirement of being less than 10.1.0 as specified by imageio.

After making this change, your requirements.txt should look like this (I'm only showing the changed line for brevity):

```
...
opencv-python==4.10.0.84
optree==0.12.1
packaging==24.1
pillow==10.0.1
pip-api==0.0.34
...
```

This adjustment should resolve the conflict between imageio and Pillow. 

If you're still encountering issues after this change, it might be helpful to:

1. Clear your pip cache: `pip cache purge`
2. Upgrade pip to the latest version: `pip install --upgrade pip`
3. Try installing the requirements with the `--no-cache-dir` option: 
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
   ```

Remember, when working in Colab, some packages are pre-installed and managed by the Colab environment. If you continue to face conflicts, you might need to adapt your code to work with the versions of packages that Colab provides, or consider using a different environment for your project.

Would you like me to explain anything else about this change or provide any additional troubleshooting steps?
