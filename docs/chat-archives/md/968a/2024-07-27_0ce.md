 Based on the code you've shared, the file copying functionality seems to be implemented correctly. However, if you're not seeing any files being copied, there could be a few reasons for this:

1. Error Handling: The `execute` method doesn't have any error handling. If an error occurs, it might be silently failing. Try wrapping the content of `execute` in a try-catch block:

   ```javascript
   async execute(message) {
     try {
       // ... existing code ...
     } catch (error) {
       logger.error('Error in FileCopy execute:', error);
     }
   }
   ```

2. Permissions: Ensure that the process has the necessary permissions to read from the source and write to the destination.

3. Paths: Double-check that the `source` and `destination` paths are correct. You're logging these, so verify in the logs that they point to the expected locations.

4. Asynchronous Operation: The `copyFile` and `copyDirectory` operations are asynchronous, but you're not waiting for them to complete before emitting the message. Try adding `await`:

   ```javascript
   if (sourceStat.isFile()) {
     logger.log('copying file');
     await copyFile(source, destination);
   } else if (sourceStat.isDirectory()) {
     logger.log('copying dir');
     await this.copyDirectory(source, destination);
   }

   // Only emit after copy operations are complete
   this.emit('message', message);
   ```

5. Overwriting: If the destination file already exists, `copyFile` will overwrite it. If you're not seeing changes, it might be because the files are identical.

6. Relative Paths: Make sure that relative paths are resolved correctly. Your code uses `path.join` with `message.applicationRootDir`, which should handle this, but verify that `message.applicationRootDir` is set correctly.

7. Debugging: Add more detailed logging throughout the process. For example:

   ```javascript
   logger.log(`About to copy from ${source} to ${destination}`);
   await copyFile(source, destination);
   logger.log(`Finished copying from ${source} to ${destination}`);
   ```

8. File System Events: If you're checking for the copied files immediately after the operation, remember that file system operations can sometimes take a moment to be visible. Try adding a small delay or using a file system watcher to confirm when the operation is complete.

If after checking these points you're still not seeing files being copied, you might want to add more granular logging or use a debugger to step through the code and see exactly where it might be failing or not behaving as expected.
