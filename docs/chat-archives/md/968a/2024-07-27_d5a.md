 I see you've tried the shallow clone method with `--depth 1`, but unfortunately, you're still encountering a similar error. This persistent issue suggests that the problem might be related to your network connection or some interference between your system and GitHub's servers. Let's try a few more approaches:

1. Increase Git buffer size and timeout:
   Run these commands and then try cloning again:
   ```
   git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
   git config --global http.lowSpeedLimit 0
   git config --global http.lowSpeedTime 999999
   ```

2. Use Git protocol instead of HTTPS:
   ```
   git clone git://github.com/danja/hyperdata-static.git
   ```

3. Clone with specific Git version:
   If you have an older version of Git installed alongside your current one, try:
   ```
   GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 /path/to/older/git clone https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-static.git
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/older/git` with the actual path to an older Git version if available.

4. Try cloning with verbose output to get more information:
   ```
   GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1 git clone https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-static.git
   ```

5. Check your proxy settings:
   If you're behind a proxy, ensure your Git proxy settings are correct:
   ```
   git config --global http.proxy http://proxyuser:proxypwd@proxy.server.com:8080
   ```
   Replace with your actual proxy details.

6. Temporarily disable IPv6:
   Sometimes IPv6 can cause issues. Try disabling it temporarily:
   ```
   git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
   git -c http.version=1.1 clone https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-static.git
   ```

7. If possible, try cloning on a different network or from a different machine to isolate whether the issue is specific to your current setup.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to:
- Contact your network administrator if you're on a corporate or institutional network.
- Report the issue to GitHub support, as it could be a problem on their end.
- As a last resort, you could download the ZIP file of the repository from the GitHub website and then initialize it as a Git repository locally.

Would you like me to explain any of these methods in more detail?
