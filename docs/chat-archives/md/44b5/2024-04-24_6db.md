 If we're looking for whimsical names that a chimpanzee constructor might use for the individual nodes within a processing graph or network, here are some ideas:

1. Banana Nodes
2. Coconut Hubs
3. Monkey Pods
4. Ape Orbs
5. Primate Knots
6. Jungle Junctions
7. Treetop Nodes
8. Chimp Chunks
9. Simian Spheres
10. Groovy Globes

The naming theme here is taking commonplace computing terms like "nodes" or "hubs" and giving them a jungle/primate twist.

For example:
"The new Banana Nodes are optimized for parallel processing."
"We'll need to add some Coconut Hubs to distribute the workload."
"Those Primate Knots in the core are becoming a bottleneck."
"The Ape Orbs at the edges handle the data ingestion."

Continuing the chimp/jungle motif allows for creative and amusing alternatives to dry technical terms. Visually, you could represent the nodes as stylized bananas, coconuts, monkey fist knots, or other tropical imagery.

The silly names add character and personality, while still conveying the functional concept of interconnected processing components. As long as the context is appropriate, having a bit of fun with the naming conventions could make otherwise complex architectures more approachable and memorable.
