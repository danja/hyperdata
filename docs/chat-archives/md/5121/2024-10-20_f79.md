 Based on your requirements, I would suggest using Docker with a lightweight Linux distribution as the base. This setup can provide a sandboxed environment that's easy to install cross-platform and offers the flexibility you need. Here's a recommendation:

1. Use Alpine Linux as the base image:
Alpine is an extremely lightweight Linux distribution that still supports package management through its package manager, apk. It's not Ubuntu-based, but it's very popular for containerized applications due to its small size and efficiency.

2. Create a custom Dockerfile:
You can create a Dockerfile that starts with Alpine and adds the components you need. Here's an example:

<antThinking>This Dockerfile is a good candidate for an artifact. It's substantial, self-contained, and likely to be modified or reused. I'll create a new artifact for it.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="custom-alpine-dockerfile" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="dockerfile" title="Custom Alpine Linux Dockerfile">
FROM alpine:latest

# Install Node.js, npm, and nginx
RUN apk add --update nodejs npm nginx

# Install any other packages you need
RUN apk add --no-cache bash curl

# Set up nginx
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
EXPOSE 80 8080

# Set up a non-root user
RUN adduser -D myuser
USER myuser

# Set up working directory
WORKDIR /home/myuser/app

# Copy your application files
COPY . .

# Install any Node.js dependencies
RUN npm install

# Start nginx and your Node.js application
CMD nginx && node app.js
</antArtifact>

This Dockerfile:
- Starts with Alpine Linux
- Installs Node.js, npm, and nginx
- Adds bash and curl as examples of additional packages
- Sets up nginx and exposes ports 80 and 8080
- Creates a non-root user for better security
- Sets up a working directory and copies your application files
- Installs Node.js dependencies
- Starts nginx and your Node.js application

3. Use Docker Compose:
To make it even easier to manage your setup, you can use Docker Compose. This allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications.

<antThinking>A Docker Compose file would be a good addition to the Dockerfile. It's substantial, self-contained, and likely to be modified. I'll create a new artifact for it.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="docker-compose-yml" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="yaml" title="Docker Compose Configuration">
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./app:/home/myuser/app
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
</antArtifact>

This setup provides several advantages:

1. Lightweight: Alpine Linux is very small, typically under 5MB for the base image.
2. Cross-platform: Docker runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
3. Easy to install: Docker Desktop provides an easy installation process on most platforms.
4. Flexible: You can easily add more packages using Alpine's package manager (apk).
5. Isolated: Docker provides good isolation for your applications.
6. Port mapping: You can easily map container ports to host ports.
7. Easy to distribute: You can share your Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml, making it easy for others to replicate your environment.

To use this setup:

1. Install Docker on your machine.
2. Create a directory for your project.
3. Create a Dockerfile with the content provided above.
4. Create a docker-compose.yml file with the content provided above.
5. Run `docker-compose up --build` in your project directory.

This solution meets your requirements while being lightweight and easy to set up across different platforms. You can easily modify the Dockerfile to add more packages or change configurations as needed.
