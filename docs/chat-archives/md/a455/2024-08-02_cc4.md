 I'll provide a list of websites to which Dan Brickley has contributed, including his own and FOAF-related sites. However, please note that I don't have real-time access to the current status of websites, so I can't definitively say which ones are still live. Additionally, my information might not be completely up-to-date, so it's always a good idea to double-check. Here's the list:

1. xmlns.com - Dan Brickley's personal website
2. danbri.org - Another personal site/blog
3. foaf-project.org - The main FOAF (Friend of a Friend) project website
4. rdfweb.org - An early site related to RDF and FOAF development
5. w3.org/RDF/ - W3C's RDF (Resource Description Framework) pages, to which Dan contributed
6. swordfish.rdfweb.org - An experimental FOAF site
7. wiki.foaf-project.org - FOAF project wiki
8. planetrdf.com - A blog aggregator for the Semantic Web community
9. semanticweb.org - Semantic Web community site
10. schema.org - A collaborative effort to create schemas for structured data on the internet
11. lists.foaf-project.org - Mailing lists related to FOAF
12. www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-foaf.html - An article on IBM's developer site about FOAF (likely archived)
13. vapours.rdfweb.org - Another experimental RDF/FOAF site
14. jibbering.com/foaf/ - FOAF validator and viewer
15. xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ - FOAF vocabulary specification

Remember that some of these sites may no longer be active or may have changed over time. Dan Brickley has been a significant contributor to the Semantic Web and FOAF communities, so his work may appear on many other sites as well. If you're looking for the most up-to-date information, I'd recommend checking his current social media profiles or professional pages.
