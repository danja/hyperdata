 Here are some science fiction examples that could help demonstrate the differences between utopian and dystopian to a child:

Utopian Examples:

- The Culture series by Iain M. Banks - An advanced interstellar society where technology, intelligence, and benevolent AIs allow citizens to live in comfort, security, and pursue their creative passions. There is no money, poverty, or material want.

- Star Trek's United Federation of Planets - A post-scarcity democracy that provides a high standard of living and opportunities for self-betterment for all citizens. Focus is on peaceful exploration and diplomacy.

Dystopian Examples:  

- Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell - Totalitarian government that controls every aspect of citizens' lives through propaganda, surveillance, and enforcement. Individuality, dissent, and truth are crushed.

- The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins - Wealthy Capitol exploits and controls poorer Districts, forcing them to offer up tributes to fight in gladiatorial games. Illustrates societal oppression and inequality.  

- The Matrix (first film) - Machines have imprisoned humans in an artificial simulated reality while using their bodies as energy sources. Explores idea of technological dystopia and nature of reality/illusion.

I tried to pick recognizable and accessible examples that vividly illustrate the key differences. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional examples to recommend!
