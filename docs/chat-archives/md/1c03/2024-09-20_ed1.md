 Yes, there are a few quotes and proverbs that convey a similar sentiment to "don't ask stupid questions." One of the most well-known is:

"There are no stupid questions, only stupid answers."

This quote is often attributed to Carl Sagan, though its true origin is uncertain. It actually encourages asking questions, but it's sometimes used sarcastically to imply that a question was, in fact, stupid.

Another relevant quote is:

"The only stupid question is the one that is not asked."

This quote promotes asking questions and is often used in educational or professional settings to encourage people to seek clarification when needed.

There's also a popular saying:

"Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt."

While this doesn't specifically mention questions, it suggests that it's better not to reveal one's ignorance, which could be applied to asking questions perceived as foolish.

It's worth noting that most modern educational and professional philosophies encourage asking questions, even if they might seem "stupid," as it's generally seen as a way to learn and improve understanding.
