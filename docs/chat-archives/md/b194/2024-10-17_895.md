I am in the process of integrating `ModuleLoader.js` into the application. Its intended purpose is so that on given a command like `./trans ../trans-apps/applications/module-load-test ` it will retrieve files `transmissions.ttl` and `processors-config.ttl` from that dir which define the applications functionality. This part is working fine. But those definitions may require  processor that aren't in the core modules in `transmissions/src/processors`​, but instead appear in source files in the remote target, in this case `trans-apps/applications/module-load-test/transmissions.ttl refers to `trans-apps/applications/module-load-test/processors/Concat.js`  The goal is for transmissions/src/engine/TransmissionBuilder.js`​to take the object it has been given in `moduleLoader` and dynamically incorporate whatever modules it carries into the `Transmission` s it build, in the same way it would if say `transmissions/src/processors/flow/ForEach.js`​ was mentioned in `transmissions.ttl`. You job is to tell me how to modify `transmissions/src/engine/TransmissionBuilder.js`​to make this happen, without breaking any of the existing functionality.
