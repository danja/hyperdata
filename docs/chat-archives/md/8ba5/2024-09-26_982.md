 Certainly! I'll describe the flat file format and organization system that Federated Wiki (FedWiki) uses to store pages. This information is crucial for understanding how FedWiki manages content at the file system level.

<antThinking>A detailed description of FedWiki's file format and organization is a good candidate for an artifact. It's substantial, self-contained, and likely to be referenced for understanding or implementation purposes. I'll create a new artifact with the identifier "fedwiki-file-format".</antThinking>

# Federated Wiki (FedWiki) File Format and Organization

FedWiki uses a flat file system to store pages and their associated data. Each page is represented by a JSON file, and these files are organized in a specific directory structure.

## Directory Structure

```
wiki/
├── status/
│   └── ... (status files)
├── assets/
│   └── ... (uploaded files)
└── pages/
    ├── page-slug-1.json
    ├── page-slug-2.json
    └── ... (more page files)
```

- The `wiki/` directory is the root of the FedWiki site.
- `status/` contains files related to the site's operational status.
- `assets/` stores uploaded files (images, documents, etc.).
- `pages/` contains the actual page content files.

## Page File Format

Each page is stored as a JSON file in the `pages/` directory. The filename is a URL-friendly version of the page title (slug).

Example: `welcome-visitors.json`

The JSON structure typically looks like this:

```json
{
  "title": "Welcome Visitors",
  "story": [
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "id": "7b56f71a9b63abc8",
      "text": "Welcome to this federated wiki site. From this page you can find who we are and what we do."
    },
    {
      "type": "image",
      "id": "9a96365799c9b1d6",
      "text": "This is an image caption",
      "size": "wide",
      "url": "/assets/image.jpg"
    }
  ],
  "journal": [
    {
      "type": "create",
      "item": {
        "title": "Welcome Visitors",
        "story": []
      },
      "date": 1420070400001
    },
    {
      "type": "add",
      "id": "7b56f71a9b63abc8",
      "item": {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "id": "7b56f71a9b63abc8",
        "text": "Welcome to this federated wiki site. From this page you can find who we are and what we do."
      },
      "date": 1420070400002
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Components:

1. **title**: The page title.
2. **story**: An array of content items (paragraphs, images, etc.) that make up the page.
3. **journal**: A log of all changes made to the page, preserving its entire edit history.

### Story Items:

Each item in the `story` array represents a content element and has:
- **type**: The kind of content (e.g., "paragraph", "image", "html").
- **id**: A unique identifier for the item.
- **text**: The actual content or caption.
- Additional fields depending on the item type (e.g., "url" for images).

### Journal Entries:

Each entry in the `journal` array represents an action and includes:
- **type**: The kind of action (e.g., "create", "add", "edit", "remove").
- **date**: Timestamp of the action.
- **item**: The content affected by the action.

## Asset Files

Files uploaded to the wiki (like images) are stored in the `assets/` directory. Their filenames are typically hash-based to ensure uniqueness.

## Version Control

The journal in each page file acts as a built-in version control system, allowing for page history tracking and potential rollbacks.

This description covers the main aspects of how FedWiki organizes and stores its content using a flat file system. Key points to remember:

1. Each page is a separate JSON file.
2. The file structure is simple and human-readable.
3. All edit history is preserved within the page file itself.
4. Assets (like images) are stored separately from page content.

This flat file structure makes FedWiki sites easy to backup, version control, and synchronize across different instances, which is crucial for its federated nature.

Is there any specific part of this file format or organization system you'd like me to elaborate on further?
