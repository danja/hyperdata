 Certainly! I'll modify the crimson house version to have a black stick figure as you requested. This change will create a nice contrast between the house, the Wi-Fi signals, and the figure.

<antThinking>I'll create a new version of the logo based on the crimson house design from the previous set, but with a black stick figure. This minor change could significantly impact the visual balance of the logo.</antThinking>

Here's the updated logo with the changes you requested:

1. House Color: Crimson (#DC143C)
2. Wi-Fi Signals: Pale Blue (#4A90E2)
3. Stick Figure: Black (#000000)
4. Door: White (#FFFFFF)

This combination creates a striking visual with the following characteristics:

- The crimson house provides a bold and energetic backdrop.
- The pale blue Wi-Fi signals stand out against the crimson, emphasizing the "broadcasting" aspect of the concept.
- The black stick figure creates a strong contrast against both the crimson house and the white door, making it more prominent.
- The white door helps to break up the crimson and provides a clean background for the stick figure.

This color scheme offers a good balance of eye-catching elements (the crimson house and pale blue signals) with a grounding element (the black figure). It's visually striking while still maintaining clarity in its symbolism.

The black stick figure might represent the individual user more distinctly, potentially emphasizing the personal nature of self-hosted content.

Do you like this combination? Would you like to see any further adjustments or variations based on this design?
