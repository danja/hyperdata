 To identify which version of a Lilygo T-Watch-2020 you have, you'll need to look at a few key features. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Check the physical appearance:
   - T-Watch-2020 V1: Has a single button on the right side.
   - T-Watch-2020 V2: Has three buttons on the right side.
   - T-Watch-2020 V3: Similar to V2, but may have slight differences in component layout.

2. Look at the main chip:
   - V1 and V2 typically use the ESP32-PICO-D4 chip.
   - V3 often uses the ESP32-PICO-D4 or ESP32-D0WDQ6 chip.

3. Check the power management chip:
   - V1 uses the AXP202 chip.
   - V2 and V3 use the AXP202 or AXP192 chip.

4. Examine the accelerometer:
   - V1 uses the BMA423 accelerometer.
   - V2 and V3 may use either BMA423 or MPU6050.

5. Look for additional features:
   - V3 might include a microphone, which is not present in V1 or V2.

6. Check the PCB markings:
   - Sometimes, the version number is printed directly on the PCB.

7. Software identification:
   - If you can run code on the device, you might be able to query the hardware to determine the specific components, which can help identify the version.

If you're still unsure after checking these points, you could compare your watch to images of different versions online or consult the documentation that came with your device.

Would you like me to explain how to check any of these features in more detail?
