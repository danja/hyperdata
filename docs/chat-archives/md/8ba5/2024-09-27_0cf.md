 The figure you're referring to is called a "homunculus" or more specifically, a "sensory homunculus" or "cortical homunculus."

The term "homunculus" literally means "little man" in Latin. In neuroscience, there are two main types of homunculi:

1. Sensory Homunculus (also called Penfield's Homunculus):
   This represents the sensory map of the human body in the brain's somatosensory cortex. It shows how much of the brain is devoted to processing sensory input from different body parts.

2. Motor Homunculus:
   This represents the motor map of the human body in the brain's motor cortex. It illustrates how much of the brain is devoted to controlling movement in different body parts.

These homunculi are often depicted as distorted human figures, with body parts sized proportionally to the amount of brain space dedicated to them. For example, the hands and face are typically much larger than other body parts because they have more sensory receptors and require more precise control.

The concept was developed and popularized by neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield in the 1930s and 1940s through his work on epilepsy patients. He mapped the sensory and motor cortices of the brain by electrically stimulating different areas and observing the patients' responses.

These visual representations are valuable tools in neuroscience and medicine for understanding how the brain processes sensory information and controls movement across different parts of the body.
