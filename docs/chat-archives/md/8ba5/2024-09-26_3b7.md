 Certainly! Here's a pseudocode implementation for the game you've described, which sounds like a variation of the classic "Simon" game:

```
Initialize game variables:
    sequence = empty list
    maximum_level = 20
    time_limit = 5 seconds
    current_level = 1

Function play_game():
    While current_level <= maximum_level:
        Add a random tone/light to sequence
        Play_sequence(sequence)
        user_sequence = Get_user_input(length of sequence, time_limit)
        
        If user_sequence matches sequence:
            Increment current_level
            Display success message
        Else:
            End game (failure)
    
    If current_level > maximum_level:
        End game (victory)

Function play_sequence(sequence):
    For each tone/light in sequence:
        Activate corresponding light
        Play corresponding tone
        Wait for short duration
        Deactivate light

Function get_user_input(expected_length, time_limit):
    Initialize empty user_sequence
    Start timer
    
    While length of user_sequence < expected_length and timer < time_limit:
        If user input detected:
            Append input to user_sequence
            Activate corresponding light
            Play corresponding tone
            Wait for short duration
            Deactivate light
    
    If timer >= time_limit:
        End game (time out)
    
    Return user_sequence

Function main():
    Initialize hardware (lights, tone generator, input buttons)
    Display welcome message
    Wait for start button press
    play_game()
    Display final score
    Ask if user wants to play again
```

This pseudocode outlines the basic structure of the game:

1. The `play_game` function manages the overall game flow, adding to the sequence and checking the user's input.
2. `play_sequence` handles playing back the current sequence to the user.
3. `get_user_input` collects the user's attempt at repeating the sequence, with a time limit.
4. The `main` function initializes the game and handles replay.

To implement this on your specific hardware:

1. You'd need to define the actual tones and lights used.
2. Implement the hardware-specific functions for activating lights, playing tones, and detecting user input.
3. Adjust the time limit and maximum level as needed for your desired difficulty.

Would you like me to explain any part of this pseudocode in more detail?
