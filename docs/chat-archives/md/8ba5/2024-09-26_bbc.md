 Solenoid valves for refrigerators typically operate on low voltage DC or AC power. Here's a breakdown of common voltage ranges:

1. DC Voltage:
   - 12V DC is very common
   - 24V DC is also frequently used

2. AC Voltage:
   - 24V AC is often used
   - 110V-120V AC (in North America)
   - 220V-240V AC (in many other parts of the world)

For the specific Bitron type 510 solenoid valve, without looking at its exact specifications, I can provide some general insights:

1. Most likely operates on low voltage:
   - Probably 12V DC or 24V AC/DC

2. Reasons for low voltage operation:
   - Safety: Lower voltages are safer in appliances that may come into contact with water or condensation
   - Energy efficiency: Lower power consumption
   - Compatibility with refrigerator control boards, which often operate on low voltage

3. Variation possibility:
   - Some models might be designed for direct connection to mains voltage (110V or 220V AC), but this is less common for modern refrigerator components

4. Power consumption:
   - Typically ranges from 3 to 15 watts, depending on the specific model and application

It's important to note that:

1. The exact voltage can vary depending on the specific refrigerator model and manufacturer.
2. Always check the specifications of your particular refrigerator and the replacement part to ensure compatibility.
3. Using a valve with the wrong voltage can lead to malfunction or damage to the refrigerator's electrical system.

If you're replacing this component, it's crucial to match the voltage and other specifications exactly with the original part or as specified by the refrigerator manufacturer. If you're unsure, consulting the refrigerator's service manual or a professional technician is advisable.
