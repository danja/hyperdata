 I apologize for the confusion. You're absolutely right, and I thank you for pointing that out. I made a mistake in describing the SVG code and didn't properly match the description to the actual code. Let me correct this error and provide you with an SVG that actually matches the description I gave earlier.

<antThinking>I need to create a new SVG that accurately represents the house with Wi-Fi signals as I described earlier. This will be a new artifact to replace the incorrect one.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="corrected-self-hosted-content-logo" type="image/svg+xml" title="Corrected Self-Hosted Content Campaign Logo">
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <!-- House shape -->
  <path d="M10 50 L50 10 L90 50 L80 50 L80 90 H20 V50 Z" fill="#4A90E2"/>
  <!-- Door -->
  <rect x="40" y="60" width="20" height="30" fill="#FFFFFF"/>
  <!-- WiFi signals -->
  <path d="M35 45 A30 30 0 0 1 65 45" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="5"/>
  <path d="M40 35 A20 20 0 0 1 60 35" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="5"/>
  <path d="M45 25 A10 10 0 0 1 55 25" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="5"/>
</svg>
</antArtifact>

I sincerely apologize for my earlier mistake. This new SVG correctly represents a house icon with Wi-Fi signals emanating from it, as I originally described. Here's a breakdown of the elements:

1. The first `<path>` creates a blue house shape.
2. The `<rect>` element adds a white door to the house.
3. The three `<path>` elements at the end create the white Wi-Fi signal arcs above the house.

This SVG should now accurately match the description of "a house icon with a Wi-Fi signal emanating from it, symbolizing self-hosted content broadcast to the world."

Thank you for your patience, and I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. Is there anything you'd like me to explain or modify about this corrected SVG?
