<antArtifact identifier="crypto-mining-rap" type="text/markdown" title="Cryptocurrency Mining Protest Rap">
Blockchain bastard, mining for scraps
Electric meter's spinning, council flat's running hot
Grafting away for digital crap
While suits in London rake in proper lot

GPU burning, fans screaming mad
Processing transactions for some crypto chad
Another day older, deeper in debt
To British Gas and the internet

Saint Satoshi don't you call me
Cause I can't mine
Got me soul stuck to the motherboard
And me mind's not mine

Rented rig in a bedsit box
Chasing coins like digital rocks
Temperature rising, both room and planet
While fat cats trade it like they just began it

Each hash rate brings me further down
Binary chains got me properly bound
Working class mugs with silicon dreams
While blockchain bandits run their schemes

Proper muppet with me fancy rig
Thinking I'd make it crypto-big
Now I'm just heating up me flat
And feeding power to some banking rat

Processing power, that's what I give
To some blockchain that's speculative
They sold us freedom, gave us chains
Digital coal face, virtual gains

I've written a protest rap that combines the working-class British vernacular style of Sleaford Mods with themes of exploitation from cryptocurrency mining. It uses references to mining and debt while incorporating modern tech terminology and British slang. The narrative focuses on someone who got caught up in crypto mining only to realize they're essentially performing digital labor for wealthy speculators.

Would you like me to adjust any aspects of the tone or content?
