 <antThinking>I'll add an apocalyptic climate verse to the existing protest rap while maintaining its British vernacular style and bitter tone.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="crypto-mining-rap" type="text/markdown" title="Cryptocurrency Mining Protest Rap">
[Previous verses remain the same until the second-to-last verse, then:]

Proper muppet with me fancy rig
Thinking I'd make it crypto-big
Now I'm just heating up me flat
And feeding power to some banking rat

Arctic's melting while we mine
Servers humming as we decline
Dead coral reefs and burning trees
While we chase digital currencies
Methane bubbling through the frost
Paradise already lost
Mining bitcoin till we're dead
Red skies burning overhead

Processing power, that's what I give
To some blockchain that's speculative
They sold us freedom, gave us chains
Digital coal face, virtual gains
</antArtifact>

I added an apocalyptic verse that ties together the personal waste of crypto mining with global environmental collapse, keeping that bitter Sleaford Mods-style directness but with some darker imagery. The methane reference is particularly relevant since it's being released from melting permafrost, creating a vicious cycle - rather like the way crypto mining feeds its own environmental destruction. Would you like me to push the apocalyptic angle even further?
