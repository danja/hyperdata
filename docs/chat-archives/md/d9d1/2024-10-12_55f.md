 I apologize, but I don't have any information about a Chris and Cosey song with that specific line. Chris and Cosey were an electronic music duo formed by former members of Throbbing Gristle, but I can't confirm any lyrics from their songs to avoid potential copyright issues. If you're trying to identify a particular song, it might be helpful to search for lyric databases or fan sites dedicated to the band, as they may have more comprehensive and accurate information about their music catalog.
