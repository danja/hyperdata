 I have analyzed the request and identified the key components and tasks required.

Summary of tasks completed:
1. Created a basic structure for the application files.
2. Defined the transmission pipeline in TTL.
3. Created a services configuration file.
4. Implemented a Concat processor.
5. Integrated ModuleLoader functionality.

Solution description:
A new application "module-load-test" has been created with a simple pipeline that uses a Concat processor to combine two input strings. The ModuleLoader is integrated to dynamically load the Concat processor. The application takes a JSON input and outputs the concatenated result to the console.

q1: How can we extend this application to handle more than two input strings?
q2: What error handling should be implemented in the Concat processor?
q3: How can we modify the pipeline to include additional processing steps?
q4: What are the security implications of using dynamic module loading in this context?
