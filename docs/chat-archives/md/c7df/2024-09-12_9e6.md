 Based on your description, a few words come to mind that could fit what you're looking for:

1. Lewd
2. Lecherous 
3. Salacious
4. Lascivious
5. Prurient

These words all describe liking or being interested in something in a sexual or inappropriate way, with slightly different connotations. "Lewd" is perhaps the most common of these in everyday speech.

Do any of these match the word you were trying to recall? If not, I can suggest some others or try to help narrow it down further.
