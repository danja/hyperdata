 Thank you for sharing that image. I can see the problem now. The baseline method is not properly defined. Let's correct the syntax:

1. Replace the content in your Playground with this corrected version:

```smalltalk
BaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF
	instanceVariableNames: ''
	classVariableNames: ''
	package: 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'.

BaselineOfStoneRDF >> baseline: spec [
	<baseline>
	spec for: #common do: [
		"Define your project structure here"
		spec 
			package: 'StoneRDF-Core';
			package: 'StoneRDF-Tests' with: [ spec requires: #('StoneRDF-Core') ].
		spec 
			group: 'default' with: #('Core' 'Tests');
			group: 'Core' with: #('StoneRDF-Core');
			group: 'Tests' with: #('StoneRDF-Tests')
	]
]
```

2. Execute this entire block of code in the Playground (select all and "Do it").

3. After executing, try to browse the class to ensure it's properly defined:

```smalltalk
BaselineOfStoneRDF browse
```

4. If the class is now properly defined, try loading your project again:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'StoneRDF';
  repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';
  load.
```

The main issues in the previous version were:
- The method definition was missing (BaselineOfStoneRDF >> baseline: spec)
- The <baseline> pragma was missing
- The syntax for defining the baseline was incorrect

Q1: After executing the corrected code, are you able to browse the BaselineOfStoneRDF class without errors?

Q2: When you try to load the project after correcting the baseline class, does it load successfully or do you get a different error message?

Q3: Can you confirm that your GitHub repository contains the 'StoneRDF-Core' and 'StoneRDF-Tests' packages as referenced in the baseline?
