 To confirm that the BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st file is being correctly read from your repository by Metacello, you can follow these steps:

1. First, ensure that your repository is up to date and that all changes to the BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st file have been pushed to GitHub.

2. In your Pharo image, open a Playground and execute the following code:

```smalltalk
| baselineSpec |
baselineSpec := (Metacello new
    baseline: 'StoneRDF';
    repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';
    record) spec.

Transcript clear; show: 'Baseline class: ', baselineSpec baselineClass name; cr.
Transcript show: 'Packages: ', (baselineSpec packages collect: #name) asArray asString; cr.
Transcript show: 'Groups: ', baselineSpec groups asString; cr.
```

This code will attempt to load the baseline specification without actually loading the project, and then print out some information about what it found.

3. Examine the output in the Transcript. You should see something like:

```
Baseline class: BaselineOfStoneRDF
Packages: #('StoneRDF-Core' 'StoneRDF-Tests')
Groups: a Dictionary('default'->#('Core' 'Tests') 'Core'->#('StoneRDF-Core') 'Tests'->#('StoneRDF-Tests'))
```

If you see output similar to this, it means Metacello was able to read and parse your baseline file correctly.

4. If you don't see this output, or if you see errors, it could indicate that Metacello is having trouble reading your baseline file. In this case, you might want to try:

   a. Checking the exact URL of your repository on GitHub to ensure it's correct in the Metacello script.
   b. Verifying that the 'main' branch is indeed the branch where your baseline file is located.
   c. Manually inspecting the raw baseline file on GitHub to ensure it's formatted correctly and contains the expected content.

5. If you're still having issues, you can try to debug the Metacello loading process more deeply by using the following code:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
    baseline: 'StoneRDF';
    repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';
    record;
    load.
```

This will record the loading process and you can inspect the result to see where exactly the process is failing.

Q1: What output do you see when you run the diagnostic code in step 2?

Q2: If you're not seeing the expected output, are you able to manually navigate to and view the BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st file on GitHub?

Q3: Have you considered using the Iceberg tool in Pharo to clone your repository locally and inspect its contents to ensure everything is in the right place?
