 Thermistors vs RTDs:

Pros of thermistors:
- Lower cost
- Higher sensitivity
- Faster response time

Pros of RTDs:
- Better linearity
- Higher accuracy over wide temperature ranges
- More stable long-term

For this application, thermistors are preferable due to cost and sensitivity advantages.

Sensor arrangement:
1. Place thermistors at different heights (floor, mid-level, top)
2. Position sensors on all sides of the robot
3. Mount infrared thermometer on a servo for 360Â° scanning
4. Place anemometer on highest point for unobstructed airflow detection

Sensitive DIY anemometer options:
1. Hot-wire anemometer: Use a thermistor with a heating element. Measure cooling rate to determine air speed.
2. Ultrasonic anemometer: Repurpose ultrasonic distance sensors to measure sound travel time between emitter and receiver.
3. Laser-based particle detection: Use laser diode and photodiode to detect dust particle movement in air.
4. Microphone-based: Detect subtle air pressure changes using a sensitive microphone.

Focus on the hot-wire approach for its simplicity and sensitivity to low air speeds.

Q1: How would you calibrate a DIY hot-wire anemometer for accurate measurements?
Q2: What signal processing techniques could improve the sensitivity of these homemade sensors?
Q3: How might you integrate multiple sensor types to create a more comprehensive draft detection system?
