 Anthocyanins are water-soluble pigments that give fruits and vegetables their red, purple, and blue colors. They're particularly interesting because:

1. Main sources include:
- Blueberries
- Blackberries
- Red cabbage
- Purple grapes
- Black rice
- Elderberries

2. Health benefits:
- Strong antioxidant properties
- May help reduce inflammation
- Could improve memory and cognitive function
- May protect heart health by improving blood vessel function
- Potential anti-cancer properties

3. Fun fact: The color of anthocyanins can actually change based on pH levels - they appear more red in acidic conditions and more blue/purple in basic conditions. This is why red cabbage can change color when cooked with different ingredients!
