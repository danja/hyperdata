 To put this StoneRDF library into a Pharo image and try it out, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a Pharo image.

2. Open a Playground or Workspace.

3. Copy and paste the code for each class (RDFResource, RDFLiteral, RDFTriple, RDFStore, etc.) into separate method categories in the System Browser or directly into the Playground.

4. Evaluate each class definition to create the classes in your image.

5. Once all classes are defined, you can start experimenting with the library in the Playground. Here's a simple example to get you started:

```smalltalk
| store subject predicate object triple |
store := RDFStore new.
subject := RDFResource uri: 'http://example.org/Alice'.
predicate := RDFProperty uri: 'http://example.org/knows'.
object := RDFResource uri: 'http://example.org/Bob'.
triple := RDFTriple subject: subject predicate: predicate object: object.
store addTriple: triple.

store triplesDo: [:t | Transcript show: t; cr].
```

6. Evaluate this code in the Playground to see the results.

7. You can then continue to experiment with other features of the library, such as creating literals, using namespaces, or executing SPARQL queries.

Remember that this is a basic implementation, and you might need to adjust or expand the code to fit your specific needs or to handle more complex RDF operations.

Q1: How can I package this library as a loadable Pharo project?
Q2: What are some good test cases I should write to ensure the basic functionality of the StoneRDF library?
Q3: How can I integrate this library with existing RDF data sources or triple stores?
