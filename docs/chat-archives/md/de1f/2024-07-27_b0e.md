 Thank you for providing the screenshot. I can see that you do have a BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st file in your project, and its structure looks correct. The project structure also appears to be in line with the baseline definition.

Given this information, the issue might be related to how Pharo is trying to load the baseline. Let's try a different approach:

1. Open a Playground in Pharo.

2. Instead of using 'gitlocal:', let's try using 'filetree:' to load the project. Enter the following code in the Playground:

   ```smalltalk
   Metacello new
     baseline: 'StoneRDF';
     repository: 'filetree:///home/danny/github/StoneRDF/BaselineOfStoneRDF.package';
     load.
   ```

3. Select the code and execute it (Ctrl+D or right-click and choose "Do it").

If this doesn't work, we can try another approach:

4. In the Playground, try loading just the baseline first:

   ```smalltalk
   Metacello new
     baseline: 'StoneRDF';
     repository: 'filetree:///home/danny/github/StoneRDF/BaselineOfStoneRDF.package';
     load: 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'.
   ```

5. If that succeeds, then try loading the entire project:

   ```smalltalk
   BaselineOfStoneRDF load.
   ```

These steps should help diagnose where the loading process is failing.

Q1: Does either of these approaches successfully load your project?
Q2: If not, what specific error messages are you seeing?
Q3: Would you like to try setting up Iceberg to manage your project, which might provide a more robust way to load and manage your code in Pharo?
