 Thank you for providing that information. The error message indicates that the 'BaselineOfStoneRDF' class is not found. This suggests that your project might not have a properly defined baseline. Let's address this issue:

1. First, check if you have a 'BaselineOfStoneRDF.st' file in your repository. It should be located in a 'BaselineOfStoneRDF' package or directory.

2. If you don't have this file, you need to create it. Here's a basic template:

   ```smalltalk
   Class {
     #name : #BaselineOfStoneRDF,
     #superclass : #BaselineOf,
     #category : #BaselineOfStoneRDF
   }

   { #category : #baselines }
   BaselineOfStoneRDF >> baseline: spec [
     <baseline>
     spec for: #common do: [
       spec 
         package: 'StoneRDF-Core';
         package: 'StoneRDF-Tests' with: [ spec requires: #('StoneRDF-Core') ].
       spec 
         group: 'default' with: #('Core' 'Tests');
         group: 'Core' with: #('StoneRDF-Core');
         group: 'Tests' with: #('StoneRDF-Tests')
     ]
   ]
   ```

3. Save this file as 'BaselineOfStoneRDF.st' in your repository.

4. Commit and push this new file to your Git repository.

5. Now, try loading your project again with the same Metacello script:

   ```smalltalk
   Metacello new
     baseline: 'StoneRDF';
     repository: 'gitlocal:///home/danny/github/StoneRDF';
     load.
   ```

If you still encounter issues, we might need to look at your project structure to ensure it matches what's defined in the baseline.

Q1: Can you confirm if you have a 'BaselineOfStoneRDF.st' file in your repository?
Q2: Does your project structure match the packages defined in the baseline (StoneRDF-Core and StoneRDF-Tests)?
Q3: Would you like guidance on how to properly structure your Pharo project for Metacello loading?
