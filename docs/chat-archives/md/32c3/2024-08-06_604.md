CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:143 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindQt.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked
  CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Qt", but CMake did
  not find one.
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt" with any of
  the following names:
    QtConfig.cmake
    qt-config.cmake
  Add the installation prefix of "Qt" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "Qt_DIR" to
  a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Qt" provides a separate
  development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
