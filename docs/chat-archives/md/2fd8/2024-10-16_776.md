 I've reviewed the `package.json` and `webpack.config.js` files. The error you're encountering is due to an outdated configuration in the webpack.config.js file. The `contentBase` option is no longer supported in newer versions of webpack-dev-server. Here's what you need to do:

1. Update the `devServer` configuration in `webpack.config.js`:

Replace the current `devServer` object with:

```javascript
devServer: {
    static: {
        directory: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
    },
    open: true,
    port: 9000,
},
```

This change replaces `contentBase` with the new `static` option, which is the correct way to specify the directory to serve static files from in newer versions of webpack-dev-server.

2. Ensure your webpack and webpack-dev-server versions are compatible:

Check your `package.json` and make sure you have the latest compatible versions:

```json
"devDependencies": {
    "webpack": "^5.95.0",
    "webpack-cli": "^5.1.4",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^5.1.0"
}
```

If these versions are different, update them using:

```
npm install --save-dev webpack@5 webpack-cli@5 webpack-dev-server@5
```

After making these changes, try running `npm run show` again. It should resolve the error and start your development server correctly.

Q1: Do I need to make any changes to the `scripts` section in `package.json`?
Q2: Are there any other webpack configuration options that might need updating?
Q3: How can I verify that the development server is serving the correct files?
Q4: What are some common issues that might arise after updating webpack and its dev server?
