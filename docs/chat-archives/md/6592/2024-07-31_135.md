 I don't have definitive information about a software project called "Griller." Software projects can be created and named in many ways, and there could potentially be projects with this name that I'm not aware of or that were created after my last update.

If there is a software project called Griller, it's not widely known or prominent enough to be part of my general knowledge base. It's possible that:

1. It could be a small or niche project.
2. It might be an internal project name for a company or organization.
3. It could be a relatively new project.
4. There might be a project with a similar name that you're thinking of.

If you have more context about where you heard of this project or what it might do, I could try to provide more relevant information. Alternatively, you might want to search for it online to find the most up-to-date information.

Remember, while I try to be accurate, I may occasionally make mistakes or have gaps in my knowledge, especially about very specific or obscure topics. If this project is particularly obscure, it's possible I might be mistaken or lacking information about it.
