I live in a rural location and my internet connection is made from my Lan through some kind of a radio link to my service provider's antenna a few miles away. Today I have internet for a few seconds and then it drops for several minutes.  I don't know if the problem is on my side, an issue with the radio link antenna, or on the service providers side, their antenna or software systems. How can I diagnose this from here? I have a Linux computer and can access the router on my Lan.
