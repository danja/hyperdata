 To exclude directories while performing a recursive grep search, you can use the `--exclude-dir` option. Here's how you can modify the command to exclude specific directories:

```bash
grep -r --include="*.md" --exclude-dir={dir1,dir2,dir3} "search_pattern" /path/to/search
```

For example, if you want to search for "example" in all .md files, but exclude the "node_modules" and "build" directories, you would use:

```bash
grep -r --include="*.md" --exclude-dir={node_modules,build} "example" .
```

You can list multiple directories to exclude by separating them with commas inside the curly braces.

If you need to exclude directories with spaces in their names, you can use quotes:

```bash
grep -r --include="*.md" --exclude-dir={"node modules","build files"} "example" .
```

Additionally, if you want to exclude all directories that match a certain pattern, you can use wildcards:

```bash
grep -r --include="*.md" --exclude-dir="*.git" "example" .
```

This would exclude any directory ending with .git.

Would you like me to clarify any part of these commands?
