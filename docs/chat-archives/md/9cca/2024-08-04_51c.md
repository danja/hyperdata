 Yes, that message is generally a good sign. Let me explain what it means:

1. "Automatic merge went well" indicates that Git was able to integrate the changes from the remote branch into your local branch without encountering any conflicts. This is the best-case scenario for a merge.

2. "Stopped before committing as requested" means that Git performed the merge operation in memory, but hasn't made it permanent by creating a commit. This is exactly what you asked for with the dry run approach.

Given this outcome:

1. You wouldn't lose any of your local changes.
2. You wouldn't lose any of the remote changes.
3. Git has found a way to combine both sets of changes without conflicts.

However, it's important to note:

- While Git thinks it merged successfully, it's still a good idea to review the changes before finalizing the merge.
- The merged state exists only in your working directory right now. It hasn't been committed to your repository history yet.

To proceed from here, you have a few options:

1. If you're satisfied with the merge, you can create the merge commit:
   ```
   git commit
   ```

2. If you want to inspect the changes first:
   ```
   git status
   git diff --cached
   ```
   These will show you what's staged for the merge commit.

3. If you decide you don't want to merge after all:
   ```
   git merge --abort
   ```
   This will return your working directory to its state before you started the merge.

In summary, based on Git's message, you're in a good position. The merge looks successful, and you have the opportunity to review before making it permanent, with no risk of losing work from either your local or the remote branch.
