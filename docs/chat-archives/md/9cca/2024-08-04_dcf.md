 Based on the git log you've provided, it appears you're encountering a situation where your local `main` branch has diverged from the remote `origin/main` branch. This can happen when changes are made to the remote repository that haven't been pulled into your local repository, while at the same time you've made local commits that haven't been pushed to the remote.

Here's a breakdown of what likely occurred:

1. Your local `transmissions` repository (which is a submodule of `elfquake`) was at commit `dde3398b77fb07bb05b742554c1028a9b0c8a6cc`.

2. You made some local changes and committed them (at 13:54:45.791, a commit was made).

3. When you tried to pull from the remote (at 13:54:47.406 and again at 13:54:58.718), git detected that the remote `main` branch had new commits (up to `8a0282a`) that your local branch didn't have.

4. At the same time, your local `main` branch had commits that weren't on the remote.

This situation is what git refers to as "divergent branches". The remote history and your local history have diverged, and git needs to know how to reconcile these differences.

Git is suggesting three ways to handle this:

1. Merge: `git config pull.rebase false`
2. Rebase: `git config pull.rebase true`
3. Fast-forward only: `git config pull.ff only`

To resolve this, you'll need to decide how you want to integrate the remote changes with your local changes. If you want to keep your local commits as separate commits, you might choose to merge. If you want to replay your local commits on top of the latest remote changes, you might choose to rebase.

Once you've decided, you can set the configuration as suggested and try the pull again, or you can use the appropriate flag with your pull command (e.g., `git pull --rebase` for rebasing).

Remember, if you're working with submodules, you might need to be extra careful about how you manage commits and pulls to keep everything in sync.
