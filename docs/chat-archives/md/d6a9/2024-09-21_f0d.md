 The official doctrine of the Catholic Church is called "magisterium."

The magisterium refers to the teaching authority of the Catholic Church, exercised by the Pope and the bishops in communion with him. It encompasses the official teachings on faith, morals, and religious practices that Catholics are expected to follow.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspects of the magisterium or Catholic doctrine?
