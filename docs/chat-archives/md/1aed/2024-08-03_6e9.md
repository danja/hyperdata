 The Department of Anachronistic Anthropology is thrilled to welcome esteemed guest lecturer, Dr. Thistle Prune-Ache, who will be presenting his groundbreaking research on the unexpected connections between ancient Mesopotamian rituals and modern social media phenomena. In his provocative new book, "Cuneiform to Clickbait: Foot Fetishism from Babylon to Instagram," Dr. Prune-Ache argues that the ancient practice of foot worship has directly shaped the content strategies of today's most successful online influencers. From Sumerian toe-rings to TikTok's "foot check" challenges, this lecture promises to walk you through 4,000 years of podiatric adoration. Prepare to have your socks knocked off as Dr. Prune-Ache unravels the thread connecting Hammurabi's sandals to Kim Kardashian's pedicures. Warning: This lecture may cause uncontrollable urges to update your LinkedIn profile picture to showcase your feet.
