 Certainly. Here are five alternative names that maintain the professor-like quality, reference plum-eating, and subtly hint at the uncomfortable condition:

1. Dr. Thistle Prune-Ache
2. Professor Barb Plumthorn Wince
3. Chancellor Nettles P. Juicepain
4. Dean Bramble Sourseat Plumlee
5. Dr. Spike Plumperch Grimace

Each of these names combines elements suggesting academic credentials, plum consumption, and discomfort in the nether regions. Would you like me to explain the wordplay in any of these names, or generate more alternatives?
