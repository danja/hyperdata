 I'll adjust the name to subtly imply that uncomfortable condition while keeping it professorial. How about:

Professor Prickle P. Plumsworth

This name maintains a scholarly tone while hinting at the sensitive issue:

- "Prickle" implies something sharp or thorny
- The middle initial "P." could stand for "Pain" 
- "Plumsworth" keeps the plum-eating theme

The overall name still sounds distinguished, but with an undercurrent of discomfort. 

Would you like me to generate more options or explain this choice further?
