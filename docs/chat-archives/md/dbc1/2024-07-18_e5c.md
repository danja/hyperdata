 This error occurs when the hash of the downloaded package doesn't match the hash specified in your requirements.txt file. This can happen for a few reasons:

1. The package versions have been updated since the requirements.txt file was created.
2. The package repository has been tampered with (unlikely but possible).
3. Network issues during download causing corruption.
4. Your pip version might be outdated.

Here are some steps to resolve this:

1. Update pip:
   ```
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

2. If you trust the source of your packages, you can ignore the hash check:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt --no-deps --ignore-installed
   ```
   Note: This is not recommended for production environments as it bypasses a security check.

3. Update the hashes in your requirements.txt file:
   ```
   pip install hashin
   hashin -r requirements.txt packagename==version
   ```
   Do this for each package causing issues.

4. If you're sure the packages are safe, you can remove the hashes from your requirements.txt file temporarily.

5. Try using a different package index:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://pypi.org/simple
   ```

6. Clear pip cache:
   ```
   pip cache purge
   ```

7. If you're behind a proxy or firewall, ensure it's not interfering with the download.

8. If none of these work, consider creating a new virtual environment and installing the packages there to isolate the issue.

Remember, the hash check is a security feature. If you're in a production environment, it's important to resolve the mismatch rather than bypass it. If you're in development, you might consider updating your requirements.txt with the latest package versions and their corresponding hashes.
