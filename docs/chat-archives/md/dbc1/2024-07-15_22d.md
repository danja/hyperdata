# Detailed Linux Commands for Performance Optimization

## Process Priority

### nice
Description: Starts a process with a modified scheduling priority.
Example:
```bash
nice -n 10 ./my_script.sh
```
This runs `my_script.sh` with a lower priority (nice value of 10).

### renice
Description: Alters the scheduling priority of a running process.
Example:
```bash
renice -n -5 -p 1234
```
This increases the priority of process with PID 1234 (nice value of -5).

## CPU Core Usage

### taskset
Description: Sets or retrieves a process's CPU affinity.
Example:
```bash
taskset -c 0,1 ./my_app
```
This runs `my_app` on CPU cores 0 and 1 only.

### cgroups
Description: Control groups for resource allocation (more complex, typically configured via system files).
Example:
```bash
echo 950000 > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/my_group/cpu.cfs_quota_us
```
This limits processes in `my_group` to 95% of one CPU core.

## I/O Throughput

### ionice
Description: Sets or changes the I/O scheduling class and priority of a process.
Example:
```bash
ionice -c 2 -n 0 -p 1234
```
This sets process 1234 to use the best-effort I/O scheduling class with highest priority.

### iotop
Description: Monitors I/O usage by processes.
Example:
```bash
iotop -o
```
This shows only processes or threads actually doing I/O.

## Memory Management

### ulimit
Description: Sets or gets user limits for system resources.
Example:
```bash
ulimit -v 1000000
```
This limits the virtual memory available to the shell and its child processes to 1GB.

### vmstat
Description: Reports virtual memory statistics.
Example:
```bash
vmstat 5 3
```
This displays memory statistics every 5 seconds, 3 times.

### free
Description: Displays the amount of free and used memory in the system.
Example:
```bash
free -h
```
This shows memory usage in human-readable format.

## Additional Tools

### top / htop
Description: Monitors system processes and resource usage in real-time.
Example:
```bash
top
```
or for htop:
```bash
htop
```
Both provide an interactive process viewer.

### perf
Description: Linux profiling tool for performance analysis.
Example:
```bash
perf stat ./my_app
```
This provides basic performance statistics for `my_app`.
