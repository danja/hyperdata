 I apologize for the continued difficulty. Given that the standard methods aren't working, we'll need to take a more manual approach. Here's a step-by-step process that should help you upgrade:

1. First, let's ensure your current sources are correctly pointing to the old-releases:

   ```
   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
   ```

   Check that all URLs are now `old-releases.ubuntu.com`.

2. Update your system:

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

3. Now, we'll manually change your sources to point to the new release. Edit your sources list again:

   ```
   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
   ```

4. Replace all instances of `old-releases.ubuntu.com` with `archive.ubuntu.com`, and all instances of `mantic` with `noble` (the codename for 24.04).

5. Save and exit the editor.

6. Update your package lists:

   ```
   sudo apt update
   ```

7. Upgrade your system:

   ```
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

8. Perform a distribution upgrade:

   ```
   sudo apt dist-upgrade
   ```

9. Install the Ubuntu desktop meta-package to ensure you have all necessary packages:

   ```
   sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop
   ```

10. Finally, reboot your system:

    ```
    sudo reboot
    ```

After your system reboots, it should be running Ubuntu 24.04. You can verify this by running:

```
lsb_release -a
```

If you encounter any errors during this process, please stop and share the specific error messages. 

Remember, this method is more risky than a standard upgrade, so please ensure you have backups of all important data before proceeding. If this method doesn't work or if you're not comfortable with this level of system manipulation, a fresh install of Ubuntu 24.04 might be the safest option.
