 I understand you're looking for a concise way to describe developers who choose their profession out of passion or enjoyment rather than necessity. Here are some possibilities that might capture what you're looking for:

1. Hobbyist developers
2. Enthusiast developers
3. Avocation developers
4. Recreational developers
5. Passion-driven developers
6. Self-motivated developers
7. Amateur developers (in the sense of doing it for love, not lack of skill)
8. Vocation developers

The term "hobbyist" is quite common in this context, but some of the others might fit your specific needs better. Do any of these resonate with what you're trying to express? If not, I can try to generate more options or we can refine the concept further.
