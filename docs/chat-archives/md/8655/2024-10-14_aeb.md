 You're right, "elective" is an excellent choice for the concept you're describing. Here's a definition:

Elective (adjective):
1. Chosen or voluntary; not required or obligatory.
2. (Of a course of study) Optional; selected by choice rather than as a requirement.

In the context of "elective developers," it would mean developers who have chosen to engage in development work voluntarily, as opposed to those who do it out of necessity or obligation. This term effectively captures the idea of people pursuing development by choice, emphasizing their agency and willingness in the activity.

The word "elective" is often used in educational contexts (e.g., elective courses), medical fields (e.g., elective surgery), and can be applied to various situations where people make a deliberate choice to participate in or pursue something.

Using "elective developers" nicely conveys the idea of people who code or develop software because they want to, not because they have to.
