 If we're working in a key where F# is the tonic (I) and D is the dominant (V), then we're dealing with the key of F# major. In this context, let's determine what scale degree F natural would be.

To figure this out, let's lay out the F# major scale:

F# (I) - G# - A# - B - C# - D# - E# - F# 

Now, let's locate F natural in relation to this scale:

1. F# (I)
2. G# (II)
3. A# (III)
4. B (IV)
5. C# (V)
6. D# (VI)
7. E# (VII)
8. F# (I)

F natural is a half step below F#, which means it's actually the lowered tonic or ♭I.

So, to answer your question directly: If F# is I and D is V, then F natural would be ♭I (flat one or lowered tonic).

This note (F natural) is not part of the F# major scale. It would be considered a chromatic note in this key, often used in modulations or as part of borrowed chords from the parallel minor key.
