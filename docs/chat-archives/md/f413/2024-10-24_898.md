 Let me explore how we might operationalize coherence tensors and stability measurements...

1. Tensor Structure Design:

Basic Dimensions:
```
C[r, a, p, t] where:
r = representation type (logical, probabilistic, linguistic...)
a = abstraction level
p = precision/formality degree
t = contextual thickness
```

Measuring Components:
- Internal Consistency (Ic)
  * Self-referential coherence within a representation
  * Measurable through contradiction detection
  * Logical systems: proof consistency
  * Probabilistic systems: distribution stability
  * Could be quantified as distance between repeated samplings

- Cross-Representation Stability (Cs)
  * How well meaning preserves across transforms
  * Measurable through:
    - Round-trip translation loss
    - Invariant feature preservation
    - Semantic drift metrics
  * Numeric range: 0 (complete loss) to 1 (perfect preservation)

2. Practical Stability Metrics:

For a knowledge unit K:
```
Stability(K) = weighted_sum(
    internal_consistency(K),
    cross_system_preservation(K),
    context_dependency(K),
    operational_invariance(K)
)

Where:
- internal_consistency = measure of self-agreement
- cross_system_preservation = survival of key features across transforms
- context_dependency = minimum context size for stability
- operational_invariance = consistency under standard operations
```

3. Implementation Framework:

For LLM Systems:
- Track embedding cluster stability
- Measure perplexity changes under context variation
- Calculate semantic drift in repeated generations
- Quantify context window efficiency

For Logical Systems:
- Count minimal axiom sets
- Measure inference path stability
- Track predicate dependency depths
- Calculate proof complexity metrics

4. Concrete Measurement Example:

```python
def measure_coherence(knowledge_unit, context_levels):
    coherence_scores = {}
    
    for context in context_levels:
        # Measure internal stability
        self_consistency = measure_repeated_sampling(
            knowledge_unit, 
            context_size=context
        )
        
        # Measure cross-system preservation
        preservation = measure_roundtrip_preservation(
            knowledge_unit,
            transformations=['logical', 'probabilistic', 'linguistic']
        )
        
        # Calculate context efficiency
        context_efficiency = context_information_density(
            knowledge_unit, 
            context
        )
        
        coherence_scores[context] = {
            'stability': self_consistency,
            'preservation': preservation,
            'efficiency': context_efficiency,
            'composite_score': weighted_combine(
                self_consistency,
                preservation,
                context_efficiency
            )
        }
    
    return coherence_scores
```

5. Pattern Detection:

Look for:
- Stability plateaus (where adding context stops helping)
- Phase transition points (sharp changes in stability metrics)
- Optimal representation zones (best stability/efficiency trade-offs)
- Critical context thresholds (minimum viable context sizes)

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects? I'm particularly interested in developing more detailed metrics for specific knowledge types or exploring how we might implement this in current systems.
