 You're right to be concerned about unnecessary bundling. Here's a suggested approach to optimize your bundle:

1. Separate build process:
   Create a separate build process for your Node.js code that generates the HTML.

2. Focus on browser-specific code:
   Create a new entry point specifically for the browser, including only extractor.js and its dependencies.

3. Optimize webpack configuration:
   Update your webpack config to focus on the browser-specific code.

4. Use code splitting:
   Implement code splitting to load only the necessary code for the browser.

5. Analyze bundle:
   Use tools like webpack-bundle-analyzer to identify and remove unnecessary dependencies.

Here's a basic implementation plan:

1. Create a new file, say `browser-entry.js`, that only imports extractor.js and its dependencies.

2. Update webpack.config.js:

```javascript
export default {
  entry: './src/browser-entry.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'browser-bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/public'),
  },
  // ... other configurations
};
```

3. Adjust your HTML to only include this new bundle.

4. Use the Node.js script without webpack to generate the HTML file.

This approach should significantly reduce your bundle size for the browser.

Q1: How comfortable are you with modifying the current webpack configuration?
Q2: Are there any specific browser APIs or features that extractor.js relies on?
Q3: Have you considered using a more lightweight bundler like Rollup for the browser-specific code?
