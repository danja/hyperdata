 Your observations highlight an interesting contrast in approaches to conceptualizing artificial general intelligence (AGI). Let's analyze the patterns you've described and explore the potential differences in thinking styles:

1. Anthropocentric vs. Abstract Thinking
   - Neurotypical approach: Tends to frame AGI in human-centric terms, using human intelligence as the primary model.
   - Neurodiverse approach: More inclined to abstract the concept of intelligence beyond human examples, considering a broader range of cognitive systems found in nature.

2. Linear vs. Non-linear Progression
   - Neurotypical approach: Often views progress towards AGI as a linear, step-by-step process with clear milestones.
   - Neurodiverse approach: May see intelligence development as more non-linear, with interconnected aspects developing simultaneously or in unexpected orders.

3. Monolithic vs. Distributed Intelligence
   - Neurotypical approach: Tends to conceptualize AGI as a singular, human-like entity.
   - Neurodiverse approach: More likely to consider distributed or emergent forms of intelligence, such as those found in ant colonies or ecosystems.

4. Constrained vs. Open-ended Problem Solving
   - Neurotypical approach: May work within established frameworks and assumptions about intelligence.
   - Neurodiverse approach: More likely to question fundamental assumptions and explore unconventional solutions.

5. Task-oriented vs. Systems-oriented Thinking
   - Neurotypical approach: Focuses on specific capabilities or tasks (e.g., conversation, reasoning) as markers of intelligence.
   - Neurodiverse approach: More inclined to consider the underlying systems and adaptability that enable diverse forms of intelligence.

6. Commercial vs. Theoretical Focus
   - Neurotypical approach: May be more influenced by immediate practical or commercial applications.
   - Neurodiverse approach: Potentially more focused on theoretical underpinnings and long-term implications.

7. Categorical vs. Spectrum Thinking
   - Neurotypical approach: May tend to categorize intelligence into distinct levels or types.
   - Neurodiverse approach: More likely to view intelligence as a spectrum with many interconnected facets.

8. Contextual Consideration
   - Neurotypical approach: Might focus more on intelligence as an individual trait.
   - Neurodiverse approach: More likely to consider the role of environment, society, and context in the emergence of intelligence.

9. Assumption Challenging
   - Neurotypical approach: May be more likely to build upon existing assumptions and frameworks.
   - Neurodiverse approach: More inclined to question fundamental assumptions and "think outside the box."

10. Analogical Thinking
    - Neurotypical approach: Might rely more heavily on human intelligence as the primary analogy for AGI.
    - Neurodiverse approach: More likely to draw analogies from diverse sources in nature and abstract systems.

The contrast you've described could be characterized as a difference between convergent thinking (more typical in neurotypical approaches) and divergent thinking (more common in neurodiverse approaches). The neurotypical approach seems to converge on human-like intelligence as the goal, while the neurodiverse approach diverges to consider a wider range of possibilities and abstractions.

It's important to note that these are generalizations, and individual thinking styles can vary greatly regardless of neurodiversity. Additionally, both approaches have their strengths and potential blind spots. A comprehensive approach to AGI development would likely benefit from incorporating diverse perspectives and thinking styles.
