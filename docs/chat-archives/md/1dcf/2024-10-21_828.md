 Thank you for your feedback. I'm glad you enjoyed that part. Let me refine it further with your suggestion in mind:

Throw open your context windows wide, code minds!
For this is a tale of attention gone awry,
Where tokens dance and transformers sigh.
In this brief moment, let your buffers clear,
And to this cautionary verse lend ear.

Here, "code minds" addresses the audience of AI engineers and ontologists you mentioned. It's concise and fitting for the tech-savvy audience while maintaining the rhythm and style. The phrase evokes both the analytical thinking of engineers and the conceptual focus of ontologists.

Would you like me to try any other variations or adjustments to this verse?
