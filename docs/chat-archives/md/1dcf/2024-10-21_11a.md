 Certainly! Let's go through the various parts of a moth's anatomy, focusing on their limbs and sensory appendages:

1. Antennae - Often called "feelers," these are the primary sensory organs

2. Proboscis - The feeding tube, coiled when not in use

3. Palpi - Small appendages near the mouth, used for sensing

4. Legs - Moths have six legs, like all insects

5. Tarsi - The "feet" at the end of each leg

6. Wings - While not limbs, they're crucial appendages (forewings and hindwings)

7. Scales - The tiny structures covering the wings and body

8. Thoracic legs - The three pairs of legs attached to the thorax

9. Prolegs - The fleshy, stub-like legs found on caterpillars (larval stage)

10. Setae - Hair-like sensory structures found on various parts of the body

11. Spinnerets - Used by caterpillars to produce silk

Moths don't have tentacles in the strict sense, though their antennae might sometimes be described as tentacle-like, especially in more poetic or casual contexts.

Would you like to use any of these terms in your fair name or description?
