 I appreciate you bringing those points to my attention. Let's revisit your original requirements and incorporate the elements you've highlighted:

<antThinking>The user likes "intelligist" for its sound, and appreciates humorous yet accurate analogies in job titles. They want a term for someone who designs AI systems, builds their environments, guides their behavior, and manages their deployment. The sheep farmer analogy is key, emphasizing ecosystem creation, care, breeding control, and herding. We need a term that's concise, futuristic-sounding, and captures these aspects while being somewhat humorous or analogous.</antThinking>

Considering these factors, here are some new suggestions:

1. AI Drover
2. Intelligist Wrangler
3. Synth Shepherd
4. Neural Rancher
5. Cognitrail Guide
6. Dataherd Intelligist
7. AIcosystem Cultivator
8. Bitstream Drover
9. Synthflock Intelligist
10. Neuropath Herder

Of these, I think "Synth Shepherd" stands out as particularly fitting. Let's break it down:

- "Synth" short for synthetic, captures the artificial nature of the intelligences being managed.
- "Shepherd" directly references the farming analogy you provided, implying guidance, care, and ecosystem management.
- It's concise and has a nice alliteration that rolls off the tongue.
- It has a slightly humorous edge, similar to "plumbers" for network engineers, while still being descriptive and professional-sounding.

"Synth Shepherd" encapsulates someone who guides and nurtures artificial intelligences, much like a shepherd cares for and directs their flock. It implies creating an environment for AIs to thrive, managing their development (breeding), and guiding their behavior (herding).

What do you think about "Synth Shepherd"? Does it capture the essence you're looking for, or would you like to explore any of the other options further?
