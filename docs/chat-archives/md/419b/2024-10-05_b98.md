 Addressing all questions:

1. Core material effects on detector coil:
- Air core: Lowest inductance, highest frequency, least affected by temperature
- Ferrite core: Increases inductance, lowers frequency, improves sensitivity
- Iron powder core: Moderate inductance increase, good for high-frequency operation
- Choice impacts Q factor, frequency range, and overall detector sensitivity

2. Signal processing for metal differentiation:
- Phase shift analysis: Different metals produce unique phase shifts
- Multi-frequency operation: Compare responses at different frequencies
- Time-domain analysis: Measure decay characteristics of eddy currents
- Machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition and classification

3. Temperature compensation techniques:
- Use temperature-stable components (e.g., NPO capacitors)
- Implement thermistor-based compensation circuits
- Digital temperature sensing and microcontroller-based correction
- Periodic self-calibration routines to adjust for drift

Q1: How does the orientation of the detector coil relative to the target object affect detection sensitivity?
Q2: What are the advantages and limitations of using a balanced coil configuration (e.g., figure-eight coil) compared to a single coil design?
Q3: How can electromagnetic interference from power lines and other sources be mitigated in the detector design?
