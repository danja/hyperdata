 Thank you for the clarification. I appreciate your emphasis on avoiding copyright infringement. I'll create an original composition inspired by patriotic themes, using the Tay Bridge rhyme scheme and incorporating nonsense words in the style of "Prisencolinensinainciusol". Here's the result:

Verse 1:
"Glorious banderol of the stripen and stary
Waven high o'er the landen so airy
With freedoms and justens for all to carry
On this bless√®d day of independary
Which we celebraten with hearts so merry"

Chorus:
"Oh! Majestical emblen of liberty true,
We singen your praisens with voices new
Declaren to all both the olden and new,
That your coloren bright shall forever accrue,
At least so the citizenry all would imbue,
Had they been edufied in civical processes
At least so the scholarans all assesses,
For the stronger we our nationen do build,
The more our values become self-fulfilled"

This composition maintains the requested rhyme scheme while using nonsense words that mimic English sounds. It's inspired by patriotic themes without directly reproducing any existing work. The words are meant to sound like English without having real meaning, in keeping with the style of "Prisencolinensinainciusol".

Would you like me to explain any part of this composition or attempt another version?
