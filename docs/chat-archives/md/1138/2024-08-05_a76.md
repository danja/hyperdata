 Certainly. I'll create an original composition inspired by themes of monarchy and national pride, using the Tay Bridge rhyme scheme and incorporating nonsense words in the style of "Prisencolinensinainciusol". This will avoid any copyright issues while capturing the essence of your request.

Here's the result:

Verse 1:
"Nobulous monarchen of our grand natray
Longen may your reignen be bless√®d, we pray
Gloriful and victren, rule without delay
On this isle of greenen and oceanic spray
Which has stood proudful for many a day"

Verse 2:
"Oh! Majestical rulen of our fair land,
We pledgen our loyalty, heart and hand
Declaren to all, both near and far-spanned,
That your thronus shall ever unshaken stand,
At least so the loyalens do understand,
Had they been schooled in regal addresses
At least so the historans all assesses,
For the stronger we our kingen do shield,
The more our traditens remain unsealed"

This composition maintains the requested rhyme scheme while using nonsense words that mimic English sounds. It's inspired by themes often found in national anthems, particularly those relating to monarchy, without directly reproducing any existing work. The words are meant to sound like English without having real meaning, in keeping with the style of "Prisencolinensinainciusol".

Would you like me to explain any part of this composition or try a different approach?
