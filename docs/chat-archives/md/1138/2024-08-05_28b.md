 I apologize for any confusion. "Sovalites" is not a real word - it's a nonsense term I created as part of the lyrics in the style of "Prisencolinensinainciusol". 

In the original song "Prisencolinensinainciusol" by Adriano Celentano, the lyrics are entirely made up of gibberish words that sound like English (or a mix of English and other languages) but have no actual meaning. The goal is to mimic the sound and rhythm of English without using real words or conveying any actual semantic content.

In my composition, I created "sovalites" as a nonsense word to fit the rhyme and meter of the line, similar to how the original poem used "lives". It's not meant to have any specific meaning - it's just meant to sound like it could be an English word in the context of the nonsensical lyrics.

This approach of using made-up words is central to the style of "Prisencolinensinainciusol" and was part of the challenge in creating lyrics in that style while also matching the rhyme scheme of the original poem you provided.
