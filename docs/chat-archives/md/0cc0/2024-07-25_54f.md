 Based on the provided files, this project appears to be a JavaScript-based data processing framework called "Transmissions". It's designed to create flexible data processing pipelines using a modular approach with dependency injection. Key features include:

1. Service-based architecture for processing nodes
2. RDF/Turtle configuration files for defining pipelines
3. File system, HTTP, and RDF-related services
4. Extensible design allowing custom services to be added
5. Logging and error handling capabilities

The project uses ES6 modules and includes testing infrastructure with Jasmine. It's set up with Webpack for building and appears to be in active development.

Q1: What are the core components of the Transmissions framework?
Q2: How does the pipeline configuration work using RDF/Turtle files?
Q3: What types of data processing tasks is this framework best suited for?
