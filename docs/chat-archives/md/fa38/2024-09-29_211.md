 Yes, there are several Node.js libraries that can convert HTML to Markdown. One popular option is called "turndown". It's designed to do exactly what you're looking for - convert HTML to Markdown.

Here's a brief overview of how you might use turndown:

```javascript
const TurndownService = require('turndown')

const turndownService = new TurndownService()
const markdown = turndownService.turndown('<h1>Hello world!</h1>')

console.log(markdown)
// Output: # Hello world!
```

Turndown is highly customizable and allows you to define your own rules for conversion if needed.

Other options include:

1. html-to-markdown
2. to-markdown (though this one is deprecated in favor of turndown)
3. node-html-markdown

Would you like more details on how to use any of these libraries, or information on their specific features?
