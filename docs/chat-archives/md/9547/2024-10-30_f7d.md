 Let me brainstorm a fun and thematic name for gnome currency! Here are some playful suggestions:

1. Glimmers - Reflecting both their association with precious gems and their clever, twinkling nature
2. Burrowbits - Playing on their underground homes and giving it a cozy feel
3. Nuggets - Simple but fitting for a race that often mines precious metals
4. Tinkers - Given gnomes' reputation for crafting and invention
5. Caps - As in mushroom caps, if these gnomes are the woodland variety 

But I think my favorite would be "Nooks" - it captures both the small spaces gnomes inhabit and could have a nice origin story (like "every nook and cranny holds treasure"). Plus it has a satisfying sound that works well in phrases like "That'll be 5 nooks, please!" or "Not worth a single nook!"

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these or brainstorm some additional options?
