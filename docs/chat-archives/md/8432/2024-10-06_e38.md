 Faiss.js, being a direct port of Faiss, doesn't natively support attaching arbitrary fields to vectors. It's primarily focused on efficient similarity search for dense vectors.

To address this limitation, you could consider a hybrid approach:

1. Use Faiss.js for vector storage and similarity search
2. Implement a separate key-value store for arbitrary fields
3. Create a wrapper that links vector IDs with their corresponding metadata

This approach would involve:

1. Storing vectors in Faiss.js
2. Storing arbitrary fields in a separate store (e.g., LevelDB, RocksDB)
3. Maintaining a mapping between vector IDs and metadata keys

Pros:
+ Leverages Faiss.js's efficient vector operations
+ Allows for flexible metadata storage
+ Separates concerns, potentially improving performance

Cons:
- More complex implementation
- Requires managing consistency between two stores

Q1: How critical is having tightly integrated arbitrary fields vs. a linked approach?
Q2: What's the expected ratio of vector operations to metadata operations in your use case?
Q3: Are you open to using a lightweight embedded database for metadata storage?
Q4: How important is atomic operations across both vector and metadata updates?
