 I apologize for the oversight. Let's re-evaluate the options based on your specific requirements.

For the small, local vector DB written entirely in JS/TypeScript:
1. vector-db: A pure JavaScript vector database for Node.js.

For the server DB, comparing pgvector with alternatives:

pgvector:
+ PostgreSQL extension, leveraging existing PostgreSQL infrastructure
+ ACID compliant
+ Supports arbitrary fields (as PostgreSQL columns)
+ Active development, growing community
+ Node.js bindings available (node-postgres with pgvector support)
- May require more setup compared to dedicated vector DBs

Milvus (previous recommendation):
+ Purpose-built for vector similarity search
+ Highly scalable
+ Rich query capabilities
+ Large community and ecosystem
- Requires separate infrastructure from relational data

Recommendation: 
- Local: vector-db
- Server: pgvector (if you're already using PostgreSQL), otherwise Milvus

pgvector is an excellent choice if you're already using PostgreSQL and want to keep your vector data alongside relational data.

Q1: How important is having a unified stack (PostgreSQL) for both vector and relational data?
Q2: What are your specific performance requirements for vector similarity search?
Q3: Do you need advanced vector operations beyond basic similarity search?
Q4: How large is your expected dataset, and what growth do you anticipate?
