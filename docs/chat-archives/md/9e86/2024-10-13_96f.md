 When sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) is added to a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, the following reaction takes place:

NaHCO₃ + NaOH → Na₂CO₃ + H₂O

This reaction can be broken down into several steps:

1. Dissociation: First, both compounds dissociate in the aqueous solution:
   NaHCO₃ → Na⁺ + HCO₃⁻
   NaOH → Na⁺ + OH⁻

2. Acid-base reaction: The hydroxide ion (OH⁻) from sodium hydroxide, being a strong base, reacts with the bicarbonate ion (HCO₃⁻), which acts as a weak acid:
   HCO₃⁻ + OH⁻ → CO₃²⁻ + H₂O

3. Formation of sodium carbonate: The resulting carbonate ion (CO₃²⁻) combines with the sodium ions (Na⁺) to form sodium carbonate:
   2Na⁺ + CO₃²⁻ → Na₂CO₃

Key points about this reaction:

- It's an acid-base neutralization reaction, where the bicarbonate acts as an acid and hydroxide as a base.
- The reaction produces sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) and water.
- No gas is produced in this reaction, unlike when an acid is added to sodium bicarbonate.
- The solution becomes less alkaline as the strong base (OH⁻) is consumed, but it remains basic due to the formation of carbonate ions.
- This reaction can be used to reduce the alkalinity of a strongly basic sodium hydroxide solution.

The extent of the reaction depends on the relative concentrations of sodium bicarbonate and sodium hydroxide. If there's excess sodium hydroxide, some unreacted NaOH will remain in the solution.
