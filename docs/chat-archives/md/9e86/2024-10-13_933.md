 You're absolutely correct, and I appreciate you catching that. My previous suggestion about combining baking soda and vinegar was imprecise. Let me clarify:

You're right that directly mixing baking soda and vinegar largely neutralizes both substances, producing mostly water, carbon dioxide, and sodium acetate. This reaction is often more spectacular than it is effective for cleaning.

The correct approach for using both ingredients is:

1. Use them sequentially, not mixed together.
2. Utilize their different properties for different stages of cleaning.

Here's a more accurate way to use both:

1. First, use the abrasive and alkaline properties of baking soda. Make a paste with water, apply it to the greasy surface, and scrub.

2. Rinse off the baking soda residue.

3. Then, if needed, use vinegar. Its acidity can help dissolve mineral deposits and kill bacteria.

This method takes advantage of each substance's unique properties without neutralizing them. The carbon dioxide production from mixing them directly, while visually impressive, doesn't contribute significantly to cleaning.

Thank you for pointing this out. It's crucial to understand the chemistry behind cleaning methods to use them effectively.
