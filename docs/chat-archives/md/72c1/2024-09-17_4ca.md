 Thank you for the update. The new error message you're encountering is related to the GTK (GIMP Toolkit) library, which is commonly used for graphical user interfaces in Linux environments. This error typically occurs when there's an issue with file dialogs or file operations.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue:

1. Update your system:
   First, ensure your system is up to date:
   ```
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   ```

2. Check GTK version:
   Verify your GTK version:
   ```
   pkg-config --modversion gtk+-3.0
   ```
   Make sure it's compatible with your Pulsar version.

3. Reinstall GTK libraries:
   Try reinstalling the GTK libraries:
   ```
   sudo apt install --reinstall libgtk-3-0
   ```

4. Check Pulsar's dependencies:
   Ensure all of Pulsar's dependencies are installed:
   ```
   sudo apt install libgconf-2-4 libcanberra-gtk-module libgnome-keyring0
   ```

5. Clear Pulsar's cache:
   Remove Pulsar's cache directory:
   ```
   rm -rf ~/.config/Pulsar/Cache
   ```

6. Run Pulsar from terminal:
   Launch Pulsar from the terminal to see if there are any additional error messages:
   ```
   pulsar --safe
   ```

7. Check file permissions:
   Ensure your user has correct permissions for the Pulsar config directory:
   ```
   sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/.config/Pulsar
   ```

8. Verify XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP:
   Check if the XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP environment variable is set correctly:
   ```
   echo $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
   ```
   If it's not set or incorrect, try setting it manually before launching Pulsar:
   ```
   export XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME
   pulsar
   ```

9. Update Pulsar:
   If you're not on the latest version, try updating Pulsar to the latest release.

10. Electron issue:
    This could be related to an Electron issue. You might want to check if there's a newer version of Electron available for Pulsar and update it if possible.

After trying these steps, launch Pulsar again and see if the error persists. If it does, please provide any additional error messages or logs that appear when you run Pulsar from the terminal.

Q1: What version of Pulsar are you currently using?
Q2: What Linux distribution and version are you running?
Q3: Did you notice any other issues or changes in behavior after adding apm to your PATH?
