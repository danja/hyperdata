 Thank you for the update. The new error message you're encountering is related to GTK (GIMP Toolkit), which is a GUI toolkit used by many applications on Linux systems. This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the expected and actual behavior of a file chooser dialog.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue:

1. Update your system:
   First, ensure your system is up to date. Run the following commands:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

2. Check GTK version:
   Verify your GTK version:
   ```
   pkg-config --modversion gtk+-3.0
   ```
   Make sure it's compatible with your Pulsar version.

3. Reinstall GTK3:
   Try reinstalling GTK3:
   ```
   sudo apt install --reinstall libgtk-3-0
   ```

4. Check Pulsar's dependencies:
   Ensure all of Pulsar's dependencies are correctly installed:
   ```
   cd /path/to/pulsar
   npm install
   ```

5. Clear Pulsar's cache:
   Remove Pulsar's cache directory:
   ```
   rm -rf ~/.config/Pulsar/Cache
   ```

6. Run Pulsar from terminal:
   Launch Pulsar from the terminal to see if there are any additional error messages:
   ```
   /path/to/pulsar
   ```

7. Check Pulsar's config:
   Look for any problematic settings in Pulsar's config file:
   ```
   nano ~/.config/Pulsar/config.cson
   ```
   Remove any settings related to file dialogs or GTK if present.

8. Update Pulsar:
   If you're not using the latest version, try updating Pulsar.

9. Temporarily rename Pulsar config:
   If the issue persists, try renaming your Pulsar config directory to start with a fresh configuration:
   ```
   mv ~/.config/Pulsar ~/.config/Pulsar_backup
   ```
   Then restart Pulsar.

10. Check system logs:
    Look for any related errors in the system logs:
    ```
    journalctl -xe
    ```

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it might be helpful to check Pulsar's GitHub issues to see if others have reported similar problems, or consider filing a new issue with the details of your system and the steps you've taken.

Q1: At which point exactly does this GTK error occur? When opening Pulsar, or when performing a specific action?
Q2: Are you using any specific themes or UI customizations in Pulsar?
Q3: Have you recently updated your Linux distribution or made any significant system changes?
