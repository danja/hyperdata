 Based on the output, I've analyzed the results from both scripts. Here's a summary:

1. github-list-runner.js executed successfully, fetching 30 repositories.
2. github-list-pipeline-runner.js encountered an error during construction.

The pipeline runner failed to create the GitHubList processor, likely due to integration issues with the Transmissions framework.

q1: Why did the pipeline runner fail to create the GitHubList processor?
q2: How can we debug the TransmissionBuilder to identify the integration issue?
q3: Are there any differences in how the two scripts import or initialize the GitHubList processor?
q4: What steps can we take to ensure the GitHubProcessorsFactory is correctly registered with TransmissionBuilder?
