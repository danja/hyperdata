 I've analyzed the output from running the github-list-runner.js script. Here's a brief summary of the results:

1. Logger set to debug level
2. GitHubList execute method called
3. Process exited with code 0 (successful execution)

The script appears to have run without errors, but didn't produce any visible output of GitHub repositories. This could indicate that the repositories were successfully fetched but not displayed, or that there was an issue with the API call that didn't trigger an error.

q1: Why didn't the script display the fetched GitHub repositories?
q2: How can we modify the script to show more detailed debug information?
q3: Are there any potential issues with the GitHub token or API rate limits?
q4: How can we verify if the GitHubList processor is correctly integrated with the Transmissions framework?
