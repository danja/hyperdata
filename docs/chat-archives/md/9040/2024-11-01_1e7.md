 Analyzed the request for AI prompt file markers and filesystem conventions.

Key task summaries:
1. Checked existing prompt markup conventions: None widely established
2. Reviewed filesystem special character usage: Typically . _ - ~ are safe
3. Assessed human readability factors: Symbol should be distinctive and intuitive
4. Evaluated keyboard accessibility: Easy to type on standard layouts

Proposed solution:
Use ".~" prefix (e.g., "~prompt.txt" or ".~prompt.txt"). The tilde is distinctive, easily typed, traditionally marks user files, and rarely used in modern systems. Alternative approach: Double tilde "~~" prefix.

q1: What are the pros and cons of using dot vs no dot in the prefix?

q2: Should the marker be at the start or end of filename?

q3: What other characters were considered and why were they rejected?

q4: How might this convention be formalized into a specification?
