 You're likely referring to the stories of the "Wise Men of Gotham," a collection of medieval English folk tales that satirize foolishness. These stories originated in the village of Gotham in Nottinghamshire, England.

One of the tales you're thinking of is indeed about an axe in a rafter. The story goes something like this:

A man from Gotham had an axe stuck in the rafters of his house. Instead of simply using a ladder to retrieve it, he came up with an absurd plan. He decided to light a fire under the spot where the axe was lodged, thinking that the smoke would make the axe fall down. Of course, this plan backfired, and he ended up burning down his own house.

These tales were collected and published in various forms over the centuries, with one of the most well-known compilations being "The Merry Tales of the Mad Men of Gotham," published in the 16th century.

The stories of the Wise Men of Gotham are similar in spirit to other European folk tale collections that mock foolishness, such as the German "Schildb√ºrger" tales or the Greek stories of the people of Abdera. They use humor and absurdity to poke fun at foolish behavior and poor decision-making.

Would you like me to share any other stories from this collection or provide more context about the Wise Men of Gotham?
