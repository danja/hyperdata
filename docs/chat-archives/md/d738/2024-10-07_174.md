 Given your international connections, I'd recommend learning British Sign Language (BSL) or American Sign Language (ASL). Here's a brief comparison to help you decide:

1. British Sign Language (BSL):
   - Native to the UK
   - Used in the UK and some former British colonies
   - Different from other sign languages, including ASL

2. American Sign Language (ASL):
   - Used in the US and Canada
   - More widely used internationally
   - Influenced by French Sign Language

3. Italian Sign Language (LIS):
   - Used in Italy
   - Less common internationally

Considering your situation:

- BSL would be most useful with family and friends in the UK.
- ASL might be more practical for your American friends and has wider international use.
- LIS would be helpful in your current location in Italy.

Given that ASL has more international recognition and would be useful with your American friends, it might be the most versatile choice. However, if you plan to spend more time in the UK or Italy in the future, you might prefer BSL or LIS respectively.

Would you like more information on any of these options or the learning process for sign languages?
