 To make a Lisp-like language Turing complete, you need a minimal set of features that allow it to compute any computable function. Here are the key requirements:

1. Lambda expressions (anonymous functions)
2. Conditionals (if-then-else or equivalent)
3. Recursion
4. Basic arithmetic operations
5. Symbol manipulation

Let me break these down briefly:

1. Lambda expressions: These allow for the creation of functions on the fly, which is crucial for functional programming and computation.

2. Conditionals: This enables branching logic, allowing the program to make decisions based on input or computed values.

3. Recursion: The ability for functions to call themselves, which is essential for implementing complex algorithms and data structures.

4. Basic arithmetic: Simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are necessary for numerical computations.

5. Symbol manipulation: The ability to create, compare, and manipulate symbols (or atoms) is a fundamental aspect of Lisp-like languages.

With these features, you can implement more complex constructs like loops (through recursion) and data structures (through nested lists and symbols).

It's worth noting that you don't necessarily need all of these exact features to achieve Turing completeness. For example, you could theoretically replace conditionals with a combination of other primitives. However, these elements form a practical and intuitive basis for a Turing-complete Lisp-like language.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide a simple example of how these features might be used together?
