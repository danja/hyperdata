 Certainly! Let's creatively split "danjanonism" and craft an eccentric art movement definition:

1. "Dan" - A common name, could represent the everyman or everyperson
2. "Ja" - German/Dutch for "yes"
3. "Non" - Latin for "not" or French for "no"
4. "Ism" - Denoting a distinctive practice, system, or philosophy

Additional splits:
5. "Danja" - Could be read as "danger" with a playful twist
6. "Anon" - Short for "anonymous"
7. "On" - Indicating action or continuation

Now, let's combine these elements into a definition for our avant-garde art movement:

Danjanonism: A paradoxical art movement that simultaneously embraces and rejects conventional artistic norms. Practitioners of Danjanonism, known as Danjanonists, create works that embody the tension between affirmation ("ja") and negation ("non"), often anonymously ("anon"). 

Key principles of Danjanonism:

1. Everyman's Art: Danjanonists believe that anyone ("Dan") can create art, blurring the line between artist and audience.

2. Yes-No Dialectic: Works must incorporate elements of both acceptance and refusal, often in jarring juxtaposition.

3. Anonymous Danger: Artists are encouraged to push boundaries while maintaining anonymity, creating an air of playful menace ("danja"/"danger").

4. Perpetual Motion: The "on" in Danjanonism represents the movement's commitment to constant evolution and action.

Danjanonist art might include collages made from junk mail simultaneously affirming and rejecting consumerism, performances where the audience becomes the artist, or installations that appear differently depending on whether the viewer says "ja" or "non" when approaching.

This whimsical, slightly insane-sounding movement challenges traditional notions of art, authorship, and meaning, carrying forward the spirit of Dadaism into new realms of absurdity and contradiction.
