Please write code for a single page browser app that will implement the following word game :

- It has a dictionary of all well-know words (including proper nouns, hyphenated words and pop culture references) beginning with the letter X
- On load, internally a word is chosen at random
- The player is presented with a row of single-character entry boxes, the first one filled in, with a green background, with the letter X
- the number of entry boxes corresponds to the length of the target word
- the player fill in their guess at the word
- if the word is the the correct one, it shows a "You Win!" message. Otherwise the boxes are filled in with the correct answer, and a "you lose!" message is shown
- a "Play Again?" button is shown, which will start another game
