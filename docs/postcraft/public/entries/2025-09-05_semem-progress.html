    <h1>Semem Progress Report</h1>
<p>tl;dr - my Semantic Web Memory for Intelligent Agents is now kinda deployable</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just passed a little milestone with this project so time to take stock. The milestone is getting the thing to run on a machine other than my office desktop - I&#39;ve got it on my server at <a href="https://semem.tensegrity.it/">semem.tensegrity.it</a> It&#39;s running in a Docker container which proved a little challenging because it uses Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss">faiss</a> for similarity measures, and though I&#39;m using Node.js throughout, that depends on native libs which have to be built first time around. But <strong>it worked!</strong></p>
<p><em>To some relative measure of worked.</em>
Thing is, although I&#39;ve been very principled about architecture <em>in my head</em> (this is an Ontology-Driven Design, <strong>ODD</strong>, for heaven&#39;s sake), I&#39;ve been delegating an awful lot of the donkey work to Claude Code, with all that entails. But this is very much an experiment, a research project. A big part of this is about figuring out the methodologies for using AI assistants in dev.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been working on Semem for about 10? months now, but it is really just the latest phase in something I&#39;ve been working on for 25? years : <strong>a knowledge management system that works for me!</strong> I have lots of projects on the go all the time but am terribly undisciplined about things and have a terrible memory.
