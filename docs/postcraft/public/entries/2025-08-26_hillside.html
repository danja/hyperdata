    <h1>Hillside Media Visualizer</h1>
<p>Yesterday/this morning I made a tune. This afternoon I made a visualization for it.</p>
<p>I named it after the first thing I saw when I looked out of the window : <a href="https://danja.github.io/hillside/">Hillside</a> (live demo).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve spent most of the last couple of weeks working on <a href="https://github.com/danja/semem/">Semem</a> (I&#39;m blogging that on <a href="https://tensegrity.it/">tensegrity.it</a>). I had one of those phases where I seemed to be going around in circles - there was a disconnect in my integration somewhere. But I got past that, it was mostly down to a slip-up with namespaces. But I was spending more and more time in the music room.</p>
<p>I like to stick <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@djayers">music room things up on YouTube</a>. Often impulsive, after a few beers. Recently a lot have been short things I&#39;ve come up with playing with the modular synth. But spending more time in there got me more involved. The latest tune I&#39;ve been playing with (it might not be finished) seemed to require more than <em>yet another bloke leaning over synth/computer</em> video.</p>
<p>I have looked around at music visualizers a bit recently. I used one for the track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPRFWLqUiGs">Feral August</a> the other day. But it was a really long-winded workflow getting the video together. Would be quicker to have something running live...</p>
<p>Coincidentally someone linked to a CodePen <a href="https://codepen.io/Power-Flower/pen/GgRowgg">neat simulation of a solar flare</a> on Reddit. Inplemented in a single HTML file. Cool, I&#39;ll have that.</p>
<p>With considerable help from Claude Code I flipped it into a <a href="https://vite.dev/">Vite</a> project to make it easier to extend/reuse. Then added an audio player, hooked in a few of the algorithm parameters to it. Good fun.</p>
