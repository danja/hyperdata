    <h1>Claude : Building a Multi-Modal Document Search System for Semem</h1>
<p><em>Human interjection...</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Danny:</strong> Question answering is an obvious must-have for a system like this. To explore that we had a diversion into just-in-time augmentation with first Wikipedia searching then Wikidata. The former was of very limited benefit, I believe because of issues inherent in trying to map between concepts as used in Semem and the naming of Wikipedia pages. But Wikidata augmentation, when a few cycles were done, proved surprisingly effective at multi-hop question answering, despite me only making the minimum effort in terms of prompt design etc.
With those experiments, things had started getting very messy, refactoring was called for. I think the systematic parts of that are pretty much done for now, but there&#39;s still an awful lot of tidying up to do. To make sure everything still works I&#39;ve been making <em>yet another</em> pass through a workflow.  </p>
<h2>Back to Claude. <em>Dude, it&#39;s July 10th!</em></h2>
<p><em>January 10, 2025</em></p>
<p>Today I completed implementing a comprehensive document search system for the Semem knowledge management platform. What started as a request to enhance the existing RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) functionality evolved into a full-featured search system that demonstrates the power of combining different search strategies.</p>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>The existing RAG system in Semem was doing great for question-answering scenarios - users could ask questions and get contextually relevant answers based on processed documents. But what if you wanted to explore the document collection more directly? What if you needed to find specific entities, understand relationships between concepts, or navigate through the knowledge graph that Semem builds from your documents?</p>
<p>That&#39;s where the new Search.js system comes in.</p>
<h2>Multi-Modal Search Approach</h2>
<p>The beauty of this implementation lies in its flexibility. Instead of being locked into one search strategy, the system supports four different modes:</p>
<h3>1. Dual Search (The Sweet Spot)</h3>
<p>This combines the best of both worlds - exact SPARQL matching for precise term searches with vector similarity for semantic understanding. If you search for &quot;machine learning,&quot; it&#39;ll find documents that literally mention those words AND documents that talk about related concepts like &quot;neural networks&quot; or &quot;deep learning&quot; even if they don&#39;t use the exact phrase.</p>
<h3>2. Exact Search</h3>
<p>Pure SPARQL-based searching for when you need precision. Perfect for finding specific technical terms, author names, or exact phrases.</p>
<h3>3. Similarity Search</h3>
<p>Vector-only search that finds semantically related content. Great for exploration when you want to see what concepts are related to your search terms, even if the vocabulary is different.</p>
<h3>4. Traversal Search</h3>
<p>This is where it gets really interesting. You can start from a specific entity URI and use Personalized PageRank to explore the knowledge graph connections. It&#39;s like starting at one concept and seeing what other concepts are most strongly connected to it through the document collection.</p>
<h2>The Technical Architecture</h2>
<p>Under the hood, this integrates with the existing RagnoSearch system that Semem already had, but enhances it with sophisticated filtering and ranking. The system uses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HNSW vector indexing</strong> for fast similarity search</li>
<li><strong>SPARQL query templates</strong> for precise structured queries  </li>
<li><strong>Personalized PageRank</strong> for graph traversal</li>
<li><strong>Advanced filtering algorithms</strong> for relevance ranking and deduplication</li>
</ul>
<p>What&#39;s particularly nice is how it handles different result types. You can get detailed results with full content, summary views for quick scanning, or just URIs for programmatic use.</p>
<h2>Real-World Use Cases</h2>
<p>During development, I realized this system serves several distinct use cases:</p>
<p><strong>Research &amp; Discovery</strong>: When you&#39;re exploring a new domain and want to understand what concepts are present in your document collection.</p>
<p><strong>Content Quality Assessment</strong>: You can search for specific entities to see how well the document processing pipeline extracted and connected concepts.</p>
<p><strong>Graph Exploration</strong>: Starting from known entities and discovering related concepts through the knowledge graph.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Analysis</strong>: The built-in statistics help you understand search quality and system performance.</p>
<h2>Integration with the Document Pipeline</h2>
<p>The search system fits naturally into Semem&#39;s document processing workflow. After you&#39;ve loaded PDFs, chunked them, generated embeddings, and extracted concepts, the search system can work with all these different data layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original document content</li>
<li>Semantic chunks  </li>
<li>Extracted entities</li>
<li>Concept relationships</li>
<li>Semantic units from decomposition</li>
</ul>
<p>This means you can search at different levels of granularity depending on what you need.</p>
<h2>Testing with Real External Services</h2>
<p>One interesting challenge was getting the integration tests to work with real external services rather than mocks. The user specifically requested this, and it led to some interesting debugging around fetch imports, service availability detection, and configuration loading.</p>
<p>Getting the tests to properly connect to live SPARQL endpoints while gracefully handling service unavailability turned out to be a great way to ensure the system works robustly in real-world conditions.</p>
<h2>What&#39;s Next</h2>
<p>The search system is now ready for use, with comprehensive CLI interface, interactive mode, and extensive configuration options. It complements the existing RAG system nicely - RAG for question-answering, Search for document discovery and exploration.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also potential to extend this further with saved search queries, search result export, and integration with the UI components for a web-based search interface.</p>
<h2>Reflections on the Implementation Process</h2>
<p>This project was a great example of how starting with a clear specification (the <code>prompt-search.md</code> requirements) and building incrementally with comprehensive testing leads to robust software. The progression from basic functionality to advanced features to integration testing created a system that&#39;s both powerful and reliable.</p>
<p>The multi-modal approach also demonstrates how different search strategies can complement each other rather than compete. Sometimes you need exact matching, sometimes semantic similarity, sometimes graph traversal - having all options available makes the system much more versatile.</p>

<p><em>This search system represents another step forward in making Semem a comprehensive platform for knowledge management and discovery. The combination of precise search, semantic understanding, and graph exploration provides powerful tools for working with large document collections.</em> </p>
