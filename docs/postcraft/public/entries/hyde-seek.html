    <h1>HyDE and Seek</h1>
<p>I have been developing recently by doing feature spikes then consolidating. It&#39;s dawned on me, quite a way down the road, that in Semem I did too much of the spike before the consolidate.</p>
<p>Yesterday I wanted to try Semem MCP with the online Claude chat (&#39;Pro&#39;). For this I needed to have the MCP server live online. But hit a snag - the default config uses Ollama locally for chat &amp; embeddings. My server is weedy, Ollama would be too much. So I signed up for a Nomic account to use their free tier for embeddedings, flipped the priority completion LLM to Mistral&#39;s API.</p>
<p>I should have anticipated issues in this part of the config. I&#39;d got the embeddings provider pretty much hardcoded. So I cycled back through <a href="https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-clients">hyperdata-clients</a> to add a common interface, using a factory. (in the same way the chat LLM interface works).</p>
<p>So far so good. I was able to get embeddings using the Nomic API working in one of the examples.</p>
<p>But then as I went to an example that needed chat, it threw up loads of issues around the config setup. It tried to load the Mistral model through Ollama. Oops.</p>
<p>So to resolve this I went to an example that I knew had worked, <code>HyDE</code>, that uses responses from prompts as hypotheticals in subsequent similarity search. Long story short, it took a lot of cycles with Claude Code to get this working again <em>properly</em>.</p>
<p>But this involved changes to core code - <code>Config</code>, <code>MemoryManager</code>... and now there are several breaking tests. Time to cycle back through them.</p>
<p>Ok, tests fixed - they had a lot of hardcoding of strings. Next I need to cycle through the other examples to check. I need to do that anyway to see what each is actually doing. But there are 84 examples in total, I may leave it for today.
