<h2>Inversion of control</h2>
<p>For a change this afternoon the <strong>AI has given me directions</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2025-05/dickens.png" alt="Robot instructs Dickension mill worker"></p>
<p>My priority at the moment is getting #:semem organized, but to that end I need some extras in #:transmissions, and better SPARQL UI... So I&#39;ve been on a little cycle round the subprojects. Which today has led me to #:tbox, which is just a Docker setup with containers that will hopefully, eventually, run the projects in a unified, consistent, portable fashion.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not very good with Docker, hate this kind of admin. After a bit of discussion with Claude I decided I need CI/CD on my thing. GitHub workflows are relatively new to me - and it&#39;s more of the same kind of admin. So I asked Claude how I should tidy up #:tbox and also how to do testing/CI. Two artifacts, 3 pages each, which I&#39;ve printed. This afternoon I&#39;ll just work through them. At least until I get distracted by the need to do one of the real-world chores I&#39;ve been procrastinating over. Faced with a more boring task, cleaning the kitchen seems a lot more manageable.</p>
<p>PS. I started following Claude&#39;s instructions, but only got so far because one of the services I want #:tbox running, Prosody XMPP, isn&#39;t working. A problem I was aware of, but I&#39;d thought it better to get the tests in place first.</p>
<p>So now I&#39;m in the process of fixing that breakage using GPT-4.1 in Windsurf. In other words, <strong>I&#39;m delegating...</strong></p>

<p>Progress! (As a Dickensian mill boss might say).</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the code the junior agent is now working on is from #:tia, which I&#39;m aiming to use as an ecosystem in which to create agents. (<a href="">dogbot</a>)</p>
