    <h1>Semem/Claude MCP Workflows</h1>
<p>At least some of the Semem tools are now exposed over MCP.  They can be made available in Claude Code by using :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">claude mcp add semem npx semem-mcp
</code></pre>
<p>Right now I really need to take a step back. I&#39;ve got a lot of example files that have run at least once:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">find ~/hyperdata/semem/examples -type f | wc -l
79
</code></pre>
<p>There&#39;s a good chance many of those no longer work following recent changes in places like the config. I got a bit impatient with tests.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Test Files  84 failed | 72 passed | 8 skipped (164)
Tests  589 failed | 1001 passed | 98 skipped (1688)
Errors  3 errors
</code></pre>
<p>Hmm, I see some are trying to call the Semem HTTP server. Ok, with it running :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Test Files  84 failed | 72 passed | 8 skipped (164)
Tests  590 failed | 1000 passed | 98 skipped (1688)
Errors  2 errors
</code></pre>
<p>Claude had a go at orchestrating workflows. I was curious to see if this might be a good approach because issuing a simple(ish) command like :</p>
<pre><code class="language-prompt">run the enhanced-research-workflow tool on the content of brain-gpt-paper.md
</code></pre>
<p>- would be a neat kind of interaction. But Claude got stuck at this level. After trying and failing to run the workflow directly, it went on to run the individual tools it uses. I asked for the list, below. This is informative. A little confusing because the naming has got a bit obfuscated that to some (unnecessary) name mapping Claude inserted in there. But I should be able to pick out the pieces, look at doing the same workflow using Semem&#39;s HTTP API, orchestrated by <a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions">Transmissions</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
Tool List in the Workflow

<p>According to the search results, the enhanced-research-workflow tries to execute these tools in sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>semem_switch_storage_backend - Initialize SPARQL storage</li>
<li>research_ingest_documents - Enhanced document ingestion (custom tool)</li>
<li>semem_extract_concepts - Extract domain-focused concepts</li>
<li>ragno_decompose_corpus - Build knowledge graph with embeddings</li>
<li>ragno_analyze_graph - Comprehensive graph analysis</li>
<li>research_generate_insights - Generate insights (custom tool)</li>
<li>hybrid_search - Setup hybrid search capabilities (custom tool)</li>
<li>semem_generate_response - Generate executive summary</li>
<li>capture_user_feedback - Initialize feedback learning (custom tool)</li>
</ol>
<p>Tool Mapping System</p>
<p>The workflow uses a tool mapping system located in:
File: /flow/hyperdata/semem/mcp/lib/workflow-orchestrator.js</p>
<p>This orchestrator maps workflow tool names to actual MCP tool implementations using the TOOL_MAPPING object and adds the mcp__semem__ prefix for standard tools.</p>
<p>Custom Tool Implementations</p>
<p>The custom tools (like research_ingest_documents, research_generate_insights, etc.) are implemented in:
File: /flow/hyperdata/semem/mcp/tools/research-workflow-tools.js</p>
<p>The error you encountered (&quot;Required tool not available&quot;) occurs because the workflow orchestrator expects these custom tools to be available, but they may not be
properly registered or implemented in the current MCP server setup.</p>

There's also a log on my desktop under :
