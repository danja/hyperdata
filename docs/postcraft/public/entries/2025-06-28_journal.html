<h2>Semem Auth</h2>
<p>I finally got around to moving SPARQL server credentials to <code>.env</code>. That&#39;s picked up by <code>src/Config.js</code> along with <code>config/config.json</code> andso it begins...</p>
<p>Auth wasn&#39;t something I was going to bother with at this stage, but while working on the HTTP API at some point Claude slipped in the use of an API key, which I&#39;ve shifted into <code>.env</code>. The implementation looked ok so I went with it. Forgetting that if the API needs auth, the existing clients won&#39;t work.</p>
<p>The HTTP API bits were really sketchy anyway, not remotely consistent. So I went back over them and they should now be ok, with <code>examples/http-api</code> in sync.</p>
<p>Which means it&#39;s now time to revisit -</p>
<h2>Semem UI</h2>
<p>It has loads of tabs which currently either don&#39;t do <em>anything</em>, or are not quite right yet. And now they all need adjusting to take into account the auth. But I&#39;ve now got all the CLI examples as reference, so it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to get things working in the GUI.</p>
<p>In the same way <strong>CLI examples can act as integration tests</strong>, so <strong>GUI can act as tutorial</strong>.</p>
<p>Which is what I need desperately myself, to figure out how to wire all this stuff up. After the initial conceptual designs I left an awful lot to Claude and I&#39;m very uncertain about a lot that&#39;s happening under the hood. It does seem to be as I wanted architecturally, but I haven&#39;t much clue about the detail.
