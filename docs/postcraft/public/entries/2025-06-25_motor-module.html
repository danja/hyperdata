<p>This worked on the 3rd attempt. First try, nothing happened but one transistor got hot. Then I discovered I&#39;d got the collector wires the wrong way around. I thought I must have fried the transistors, but maybe not, after I&#39;d replaced them I experimented a bit more. My estimate for a resistor to go in series with the motor had been way out (120R), it needed something <em>really</em> low. But it occurred to me that an inductance should work there, and I had a old PCB (from a satellite tuner PSU) on the desk next to me with the perfect candidate. I&#39;d got the old board there for the 1000uF 16v caps. I didn&#39;t bother breadboarding, went straight to stripboard. It would either work or not. The components that were candidates for tweaking were easy access.</p>

<p>This time it actually worked. After trying it for a few seconds I felt to see if the transistors were getting warm. Burnt my fingers. Motors really aren&#39;t my thing. So I made a couple of little heatsinks and hooked it up to the modular for the vid.</p>
<p>I think what I&#39;ll do is try it with a PSU of its own next. With a dummy load first, to see if the circuit is behaving as I&#39;d expected. I really don&#39;t get why it should be drawing so much current with such a farty little motor, unless the transistors are biased on when they shouldn&#39;t be. Dunno. The motor is the main unknown for me.
