    <h1>MCP Revisited</h1>
<p>While in the process of experimenting, the MCP provision has got overcomplicated. Which is kinda funny given that I&#39;ve barely played with it. I&#39;ve mostly been adding a chunk of functionality, creating example code to test it in an SDK style, and then moving on to the next chunk. But each time I&#39;ve tried to have corresponding MCP interfaces in place (as well as straight HTTP APIs).
This has led to <em>so much cruft...</em></p>
<p>To simplify, the plan is to focus on 5 verbs and state.
The state will correspond to the current knowledgebase context in terms of zoom, pan, and tilt, as in the <a href="https://github.com/danja/zpt">ZPT Ontology</a>.</p>
<p>The verbs will allow a caller to :</p>
<ul>
<li>tell - add resources to the system with minimal subsequent processing</li>
<li>ask - query the system</li>
<li>augment - run operations such as concept extraction to parts of the knowledgebase that are relevant to the current context</li>
<li>zoom - provide the level of abstraction at which to work</li>
<li>pan - the subject domain of interest</li>
<li>tilt - the filter through which to view the knowledgebase</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementations in a first pass will be wrappers around existing code. Claude Code is now having a crack - it did reckon it was done, until (naturally) it tried running the tests.</p>

<p>I see the issue! The server.tool() method doesn&#39;t exist.
