    <h1>Journal 2025-05-31</h1>
<p>This morning I was woken by Federico&#39;s tractor about 15 mins before my alarm. But that was fine, last night I prepared a flask of coffee. I did about 2 hours worth of dev with Claude before getting out of bed. Then went shopping, I&#39;ve just fixed the Claude artifacts and I&#39;m very happy. A very productive morning!</p>

<h2>JSDoc RDF Plugin</h2>
<p>It does what JSDoc does, with an output in RDF Turtle : <a href="https://github.com/danja/jsdoc-rdf">jsdoc-rdf</a> on GitHub. Something I&#39;ve wanted for years but never got around to. It became more pressing now I&#39;ve started integrating LLMs etc into my knowledgebase setup - in <a href="https://github.com/danja/semem">Semem</a> (which still needs a bit of tweaking for my artificial midsummer break deadline).</p>
<h2>OpenTelemetry in Transmissions</h2>
<p>This seems a must-have for my pipeliney thing. Ok, every node in a transmission (= pipeline) is an implementation of a <code>Processor</code>. That interface is descended from <code>ProcessorImpl</code> which does the work of running the processors. This latter now has hooks into <a href="https://github.com/open-telemetry">Open Telemetry</a>. There is space for hooks in the code responsibility for the construction of pipelines, as well as in the API bits. But being lower demand, they are lower priority.</p>
<p>I haven&#39;t a clue yet how best to make use of this, I believe I&#39;ll need Prometheus and/or Grafana somewhere.</p>
<h2>Filesystem watching for transmissions</h2>
<p>Not unrelated to the telemetry thing. Right now, the #:Postcraft doc pipelines to render this blog process every single source markdown file. So I just added this fs watcher.</p>
<p>The idea is that this will be a long-lived background process. When a file in a given dir tree changes, this thing wakes up and does a HTTP POST to a given endpoint. For the #:postcraft use case, the intention is that there will be a #:transmissions mini-service that will receive the POST and run the markdown-to-sparqlstore, sparqlstore-to-html pipelines.</p>
<p>As yet untested, but the ability to trigger transmissions via HTTP is something I&#39;ve had in mind all along. There is something approximating implementation, but I&#39;m only now getting to the stage where I can start trying it out in practice.</p>
<h2>Tip of the Day</h2>
<p>I&#39;ve currently got Windsurf hammering away at Semem. It was having diversions where it lost its thread somewhat, then repeated earlier approaches that failed... attention deficit, <em>dude!</em>
But this seems to have helped :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suggest you create a file WINDSURF.md and in it place note on strategies which work and those which don&#39;t areas of the codebase that likely need attention etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s also a good read for me (same deficit).
Also :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>remember to update WINDSURF.md as you go along. Leave yourself a note in it to remind yourself about it.
 </p>
