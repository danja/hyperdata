<h2>Semem Auth</h2>
<p>I finally got around to moving SPARQL server credentials to <code>.env</code>. That&#39;s picked up by <code>src/Config.js</code> along with <code>config/config.json</code> andso it begins...</p>
<p>Auth wasn&#39;t something I was going to bother with at this stage, but while working on the HTTP API at some point Claude slipped in the use of an API key, which I&#39;ve shifted into <code>.env</code>. The implementation looked ok so I went with it. Forgetting that if the API needs auth, the existing clients won&#39;t work.</p>
<p>The HTTP API bits were really sketchy anyway, not remotely consistent. So I went back over them and they should now be ok, with <code>examples/http-api</code> in sync.</p>
<p>Which means it&#39;s now time to revisit -</p>
<h2>Semem UI</h2>
<p>It has loads of tabs which currently either don&#39;t do <em>anything</em>, or are not quite right yet. And now they all need adjusting to take into account the auth. But I&#39;ve now got all the CLI examples as reference, so it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to get things working in the GUI.</p>
<p>In the same way <strong>CLI examples can act as integration tests</strong>, so <strong>GUI can act as tutorial</strong>.</p>
<p>Which is what I need desperately myself, to figure out how to wire all this stuff up. After the initial conceptual designs I left an awful lot to Claude and I&#39;m very uncertain about a lot that&#39;s happening under the hood. It does seem to be as I wanted architecturally, but I haven&#39;t much clue about the detail.

    <h1>Semem on the server</h1>
<p>I just went to do something unrelated with Claude chat in the browser and noticed that I&#39;d already added a pointer to Semem MCP running on localhost. Claude can&#39;t see it, so I guess the connection must be made server-side. Ok, let me run Semem MCP on a server. It <em>should</em> be doable using <code>npx semem-mcp</code>, but I want the whole shebang on the server anyway, so I&#39;ll go the long way round.</p>
<p>It should just take :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">cd ~/hyperdata
git clone https://github.com/danja/semem.git
cd semem
npm install
npm run mcp:http
# or node mcp/http-server.js
</code></pre>
<p>But the version of node I have on the server is a bit old, so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">sudo npm install n -g
n stable
node --version
# v22.16.0
</code></pre>
<p>I&#39;d better set it up through the nginx proxy to get https:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/semem.conf
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">server {
    server_name semem.tensegrity.it;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
    listen 80;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Add a DNS entry :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">semem 10800 IN CNAME tensegrity.it.
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-sh">ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/semem.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/semem.conf
nginx -t
systemctl restart nginx
certbot
</code></pre>
<p>Hmm. Bad gateway. Let me try it on port 4600 and make it 127.0.0.1 rather than localhost just in case:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">MCP_PORT=4600 MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1 node mcp/http-server.js
</code></pre>
<p>Locally :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">curl https://semem.tensegrity.it/health

{&quot;status&quot;:&quot;healthy&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;:&quot;2025-06-22T10:17:25.243Z&quot;,&quot;services&quot;:{&quot;memoryManager&quot;:true,&quot;config&quot;:true},&quot;sessions&quot;:0}
</code></pre>
<p>Yay!</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>I forgot that it&#39;s currently relying on Ollama locally.</p>
<p>I&#39;d already got support for different chat providers, but not embeddings providers, that was quasi-hardcoded to Ollama. So I&#39;ve added a bit to <a href="https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-clients">hyperdata-clients</a> and updated the relevant bits of Semem. Which is bound to break things.</p>
<p>PS. Things might be fixed enough.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve made a script containing just :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">#!/bin/bash

MCP_PORT=4600 MCP_HOST=127.0.0.1 node mcp/http-server.js
</code></pre>
<p>so then -</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh"> pm2 start start-mcp.sh --name semem-mcp --watch
</code></pre>
<p>and it&#39;s visible from MCP Inspector locally,</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://semem.tensegrity.it/mcp">https://semem.tensegrity.it/mcp</a></li>
<li>Streamable HTTP</li>
</ul>
<p>But broken. Hey ho. Next Claude Code cycle.

    <h1>HyDE and Seek</h1>
<p>I have been developing recently by doing feature spikes then consolidating. It&#39;s dawned on me, quite a way down the road, that in Semem I did too much of the spike before the consolidate.</p>
<p>Yesterday I wanted to try Semem MCP with the online Claude chat (&#39;Pro&#39;). For this I needed to have the MCP server live online. But hit a snag - the default config uses Ollama locally for chat &amp; embeddings. My server is weedy, Ollama would be too much. So I signed up for a Nomic account to use their free tier for embeddedings, flipped the priority completion LLM to Mistral&#39;s API.</p>
<p>I should have anticipated issues in this part of the config. I&#39;d got the embeddings provider pretty much hardcoded. So I cycled back through <a href="https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-clients">hyperdata-clients</a> to add a common interface, using a factory. (in the same way the chat LLM interface works).</p>
<p>So far so good. I was able to get embeddings using the Nomic API working in one of the examples.</p>
<p>But then as I went to an example that needed chat, it threw up loads of issues around the config setup. It tried to load the Mistral model through Ollama. Oops.</p>
<p>So to resolve this I went to an example that I knew had worked, <code>HyDE</code>, that uses responses from prompts as hypotheticals in subsequent similarity search. Long story short, it took a lot of cycles with Claude Code to get this working again <em>properly</em>.</p>
<p>But this involved changes to core code - <code>Config</code>, <code>MemoryManager</code>... and now there are several breaking tests. Time to cycle back through them.</p>
<p>Ok, tests fixed - they had a lot of hardcoding of strings. Next I need to cycle through the other examples to check. I need to do that anyway to see what each is actually doing. But there are 84 examples in total, I may leave it for today.

    <h1>Semem/Claude MCP Workflows</h1>
<p>At least some of the Semem tools are now exposed over MCP.  They can be made available in Claude Code by using :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">claude mcp add semem npx semem-mcp
</code></pre>
<p>Right now I really need to take a step back. I&#39;ve got a lot of example files that have run at least once:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">find ~/hyperdata/semem/examples -type f | wc -l
79
</code></pre>
<p>There&#39;s a good chance many of those no longer work following recent changes in places like the config. I got a bit impatient with tests.</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Test Files  84 failed | 72 passed | 8 skipped (164)
Tests  589 failed | 1001 passed | 98 skipped (1688)
Errors  3 errors
</code></pre>
<p>Hmm, I see some are trying to call the Semem HTTP server. Ok, with it running :</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Test Files  84 failed | 72 passed | 8 skipped (164)
Tests  590 failed | 1000 passed | 98 skipped (1688)
Errors  2 errors
</code></pre>
<p>Claude had a go at orchestrating workflows. I was curious to see if this might be a good approach because issuing a simple(ish) command like :</p>
<pre><code class="language-prompt">run the enhanced-research-workflow tool on the content of brain-gpt-paper.md
</code></pre>
<p>- would be a neat kind of interaction. But Claude got stuck at this level. After trying and failing to run the workflow directly, it went on to run the individual tools it uses. I asked for the list, below. This is informative. A little confusing because the naming has got a bit obfuscated that to some (unnecessary) name mapping Claude inserted in there. But I should be able to pick out the pieces, look at doing the same workflow using Semem&#39;s HTTP API, orchestrated by <a href="https://github.com/danja/transmissions">Transmissions</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
Tool List in the Workflow

<p>According to the search results, the enhanced-research-workflow tries to execute these tools in sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>semem_switch_storage_backend - Initialize SPARQL storage</li>
<li>research_ingest_documents - Enhanced document ingestion (custom tool)</li>
<li>semem_extract_concepts - Extract domain-focused concepts</li>
<li>ragno_decompose_corpus - Build knowledge graph with embeddings</li>
<li>ragno_analyze_graph - Comprehensive graph analysis</li>
<li>research_generate_insights - Generate insights (custom tool)</li>
<li>hybrid_search - Setup hybrid search capabilities (custom tool)</li>
<li>semem_generate_response - Generate executive summary</li>
<li>capture_user_feedback - Initialize feedback learning (custom tool)</li>
</ol>
<p>Tool Mapping System</p>
<p>The workflow uses a tool mapping system located in:
File: /flow/hyperdata/semem/mcp/lib/workflow-orchestrator.js</p>
<p>This orchestrator maps workflow tool names to actual MCP tool implementations using the TOOL_MAPPING object and adds the mcp__semem__ prefix for standard tools.</p>
<p>Custom Tool Implementations</p>
<p>The custom tools (like research_ingest_documents, research_generate_insights, etc.) are implemented in:
File: /flow/hyperdata/semem/mcp/tools/research-workflow-tools.js</p>
<p>The error you encountered (&quot;Required tool not available&quot;) occurs because the workflow orchestrator expects these custom tools to be available, but they may not be
properly registered or implemented in the current MCP server setup.</p>

There's also a log on my desktop under :
