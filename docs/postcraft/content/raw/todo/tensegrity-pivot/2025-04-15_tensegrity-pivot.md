# Tensegrity Pivot

**Milestone 2025-06-21**

All UIs should have autocomplete available.

## Aim 

Minimum viable product of each subproject such that they can work together.

* tbox : deployable containing all the things
* Tia : at least two agents
* Squirt : human <-> Semem, Transmissions
* Semem
* Namespaces
* Transmissions : Semem connectors
* Farelo
* Postcraft : set up for all projects, skeleton docs

## Soft Goal : NewsMonitorNG

Unlikely to be achievable, 

Use squirt + Farelo + semem to plan an aggregator that has backend of Transmissions + semem, front end in squirt. Have Tia build it.

## Soft Goal : Releases

* CD/CI in place
* Publish to npm where appropriate 
* Notify potential collaborators - heads up Scoble etc.
