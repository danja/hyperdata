# The Hyperdata Tensegrity Stack

I've given myself a deadline of **2025-06-21** to get the bunch of things listed here to some kind of minimum viable products. If I'm happy with what I've got to show at that point, I'll be doing announcements (haranguing the lists, socials and maybe even ex-girlfriends) on **2025-07-03**. I'm more confident than usual that I'll have at least *something* to show. I have got the lion's share of the hard parts done already.

My dev process is to cycle through the subprojects, spending a day or two on each at time. Not a regular cycle : cross-dependencies often force a different direction; things always take longer than expected; distractions (often trying dev spikes, especially now with *vibes*). 

### Philosophy
This comes from wondering about cognition, what can computers, AI achieve? What can I achieve? I'll use *problem solving* as a catch-all for intentional state change.

1. Systems can be described in terms of concepts and relationships between those concepts. *The human way.*
2. Problem solving is mostly about pattern matching. Fitting unknown systems to ones where their behaviour is known.
3. All known agents, animal or artificial, at any given moment in time, have a finite amount of working memory. This acts as boundary on what they can process.
4. Concepts can often be decomposed into smaller units.
5. Groups of associated concepts can be abstracted into meta-concepts.  
6. *_Scale-free thinking for the win!_*

### Filthy Lucre
I can see commercial potential in this stuff (nb. a ground rule is that it's all open source), but the motivation is more an Everest-ian *because it's there* challenge, my wanting to get my head around these things and, yeah, better tools for problem-solving would be nice to have. Whatever, this lot maybe best considered an **art/school project**.

### Bag of Stuff
I have been building these things as quasi-independent projects, each with their own repo. But to start seeing the utility I'm after, they need joining up, which makes a big dependency graph : a [tensegrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity) structure. *However* many of the dependencies are soft, `X helps Y`, rather than critical, `X needs Y` (cf. non-functional requirements). Some parts I've been working on for a long time (*25 years is a long time in tech, right..?*), but the arrival of Deep Learning, especially that around LLMs, forced a reboot. And obviously everything else is continually evolving. *Sitting still is not an option.*

It may seem like there's a lot of wheel reinvention, but that's mostly because I'm fed up of (other people's) frameworks. My own very limited context window needs to be used on the tasty bits, not conventions. I'm favouring ES module style nodejs and/or vanilla browser JS etc. so I don't have to flip languages so often.

All this stuff is riddled with [RDF](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework). I'll write a *Why RDF?* note (again) some time. But the **tl;dr** is twofold : the Web is the best graph knowledgebase in human history; some level of formal ontology definition helps considerably when describing things (especially knowledge).

## Sites
Hyperdata is an arbitrary umbrella name I'm using for all this stuff. I've got the domain [hyperdata.it](https://hyperdata.it) and associated hosting for any quasi-reliable service fixtures, docs etc. For experiments, maybe even useful things, I have [strandz.it](https://strandz.it).

[danny.ayers.name](https://danny.ayers.name) is the dumping ground for everything else.

## Goals
I've many, mostly fuzzy forms which require a lot of hand-waving to describe. The main high-level target is to create communities of intelligent agents which improve on the state of the art in solving arbitrary problems. This aspect I've labeled [TIA Intelligence Agency](https://github.com/danja/tia) (it has a repo but there's nothing to see yet). Some example problems below.

For pragmatic reasons, and to keep things conceptually simple, the environment will be multi-user chat over  [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/). A containerized environment will enable repeatable experimentation :

## [tbox](https://github.com/danja/tbox)

A `docker-compose` setup with :

* SPARQL Store ([Fuseki](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/))
* XMPP IM Server ([Prosody](https://prosody.im/))
* Support for various subprojects (agent boilerplate, all this *hyperdata* stuff)
* Dev tooling (ssh etc, CI/CD, observability/metrics...)

**Status 2025-05-04 :** it's largely in place, needs a lot of tidying up, hardening. I haven't got to the observability bits proper yet, but that's generally available off-the-shelf with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) kit, [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) etc.

The subproject with the most novelty is :

## Semem

Semantic memory for agents. I want this mostly defined in terms of interfaces (see Vocabs), keep it flexible. Running code essentially helpers, just lowish-level things like concept extraction etc.

Core components :

* SPARQL Store, RDF support (rdfjs & RDF-Ext libs)
* Embeddings vector store & tools ([FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), [Nomic](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai) embedding model(s))
* Resource Store (quick & dirty old school REST)
* LLM Clients
* Vocabularies

The first 4 components are fairly self-explanatory, kind-of off the shelf. What sets it apart is an ontology-backed approach to composition & choreography, *see Vocabs*...

The background to this is probably worth noting. A while back I had a play with [Graph RAG using SPARQL](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cRAflpG2v1rS9Nz6xpILpPouuvILpYlL), working with [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/). Crude proof of context. I wanted *more*, but not dependent on the whims of a framework. I stumbled on [memoripy](https://github.com/caspianmoon/memoripy) which had most of the skeleton of what I wanted. So my starting point for #:semem was a kind of rewrite that using JS & SPARQL. At that point I shifted my energies back to #:transmissions, meanwhile working on the vocabulary support - very significant, *see Vocabs...*  

**Status 2025-05-04 :** the basics are pretty much in place, although in need of a lot of tweaking, #:transmissions hooking in. Dependencies around here :

* #:semem needs #:transmissions for proper wiring.
* #:semem isHelpedBy *vocabs* - to enable to good bits
* #:semem is helpedBy *the utility stuff* - docs, visualizations etc.

## Transmissions

This is a pipeliney thing. In fancy speak, a workflow compositor.

## Postcraft

## Vocabs

 These are key. I've determined the main things I need are : a knowledge representation language (*Ragno*), a knowledge navigation language (*ZPT*), a knowledge communication language (*Lingue*) and a methodology language (*UM*).

*The primary vocab links are placeholders, they'll hopefully resolve to something useful by 2025-06-21.*
