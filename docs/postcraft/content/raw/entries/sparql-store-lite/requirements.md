# sparql-store-lite Requirements

Pivots!

The goalof this project is to create a set of ES modules for node that will provide a SPARQL interface to an RDF store which will be maintained on the filesystem as a set of graphs contained in Turtle syntax text files.

We will approach the modules one at a time and ensure each is working by means of a series of unit and integration tests run from Jasmine before moving onto the next. You will be provided with the current source files after each significant change.
