# Tidying up Squirt

Will it be possible to promote the Turtle Editor, SPARQL Query and Graph View tabs of Atuin into main tabs in Squirt? If not, what exports/changes do you think will be needed in the Atuin lib to make it possible? I maintain it, just tell me what's needed.
Some layout changes please.
Can you modify the tabs into this order :
1. Post
2. Chat
3. Wiki
4. Turtle
5. SPARQL
6. Profile
7. Settings
You can remove the Developer tab entirely.
