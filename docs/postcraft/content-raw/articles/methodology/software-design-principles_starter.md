# Software Design Principles and Best Practices

## Core Design Philosophy
- [x] Consider code from the reader's perspective, not just the writer's
- [x] Invest in good design early - it pays off quickly
- [x] Question and understand why you disagree with design advice
- [x] Consider multiple design approaches for major decisions

## Complexity Management
### Indicators to Monitor
- [x] Change amplification (changes requiring multiple modifications)
- [x] Cognitive load (knowledge required for tasks)
- [x] Unknown unknowns (unclear modification requirements)

### Prevention Strategies
- [x] Design deep modules with simple interfaces
- [x] Implement sensible defaults for common cases
- [x] Minimize exception handling points
- [x] Make module interfaces obvious to users

## Implementation Guidelines
### Documentation
- [x] Document rationale behind decisions
- [x] Focus on cross-module interactions
- [x] Place documentation where developers will find it
- [x] Write clear comments for non-obvious code

### Code Quality
- [x] Maintain consistency in coding conventions
- [x] Automate style enforcement (ESLint, Prettier)
- [x] Follow existing team conventions
- [x] Think strategic, not just tactical

### Testing Requirements
- [x] Implement comprehensive unit tests
- [x] Use tests to enable safe refactoring
- [x] Ensure high code coverage
- [x] Create tests before performance optimization

### Performance Optimization
- [x] Measure and benchmark before optimizing
- [x] Focus on critical path bottlenecks
- [x] Validate performance improvements
- [x] Document performance-related decisions

## Success Metrics
- [x] Code reusability
- [x] Maintenance efficiency
- [x] Development enjoyment
- [x] Bug reduction
- [x] Clear upgrade paths
