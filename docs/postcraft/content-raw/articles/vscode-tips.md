#### Menus too big

I'm on VSCode 1.92.2, Ubuntu 2024.04 LTS. Things seem to have changed slightly recently.

File->Preferences->Settings

Then search for "window.titleBarStyle". Flip this value from "native" to "custom".

This changes quite a few visual settings. (With the Light Modern theme the menu font became a bit too light to be clear on this machine. I couldn't be bothered finding a detailed setting to increase the font weight so have gone to Dark Modern.)

_There was a near solution on StackOverflow which gave me a clue, so I posted the above over there._
