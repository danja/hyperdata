I wish to include another docker-compose auxiliary container project into the tbox codebase called 'object-store'. With this in mind, how can the current directory structure be improved? Follow conventions and best practices as appropriate. First think deeply about the requirements, then provide me with the following as complete, self-contained, individual artifacts:

overview doc describing the logical structure of the target setup

diagram of the logical structure of the target setup

dir tree with a short description of each folder's contents and function

step-by-step instructions on how I can make the improvements, containing details of any necessary config changes. For each change tell me how to check functionality  before and after the change
