## Unsafe

Please create `src/processors/unsafe/RunCommand.js` such that it will run a shell command in a similar fashion to `runCommand()` in `tests/integration/test_apps.spec.js`. The command may be specified in the processor's config (loaded originally from the application's `config.ttl`) or in the message, or neither. The message value will take precedence. If no command value is found, the operation is skipped.

* Application example, contents of dir : `src/applications/test_nop`
* Processor example : `src/processors/util/NOP.js`

Please create unit and integration tests following the pattern of the existing tests in `tests`
