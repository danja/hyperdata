# Cleanup

I've decided using git submodules was a bad idea (interdependencies got messy). So locally I'll move those from being nested in dir tree to quasi-root level.

I'll have that quasi-root as `/home/danny/hyperdata/` which won't be under git itself, but the dirs below it will (mostly) be repos.

What was the parent repo https://github.com/danja/hyperdata I'll use for top-level docs, admin stuff etc. (locally at `/home/danny/hyperdata/hyperdata`).

I'll move the child repos over one at a time as and when I actually need them. A lot of cruft & duplication has accumulated. I've already done #:transmissions, that's now at `/home/danny/hyperdata/transmissions`, but I still need to get rid of `/home/danny/hyperdata/hyperdata/packages/transmissions`. I can do the removal of all of them now.
I just tested removal with `trellis`, that seemed ok. Now for the rest...

```sh
cd /home/danny/hyperdata/hyperdata/packages
ls

Hmm, nearby...

```sh
danny@danny-desktop:~/sites/hyperdata.it$ git rebase
CONFLICT (modify/delete): .gitignore deleted in a1fb8fa (junk) and modified in HEAD.  Version HEAD of .gitignore left in tree.
error: could not apply a1fb8fa... junk
hint: Resolve all conflicts manually, mark them as resolved with
hint: "git add/rm <conflicted_files>", then run "git rebase --continue".
hint: You can instead skip this commit: run "git rebase --skip".
```

I'll --skip.
