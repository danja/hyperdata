 Great, you've successfully launched the Pharo environment. This is the main Pharo window, which provides access to various tools and the Smalltalk development environment.

Now that you have Pharo running, here's what you can do to load and work with your StoneRDF project:

1. Open a Playground:
   - Click on the background (called the "World" in Pharo)
   - Select "Tools" > "Playground" from the menu, or use the shortcut Ctrl+O+W

2. In the Playground, type and execute (select the text and press Ctrl+D or right-click and choose "Do it") the following Metacello script:

   ```smalltalk
   Metacello new
     baseline: 'StoneRDF';
     repository: 'github://YourGitHubUsername/StoneRDF:main';
     load.
   ```

   Replace 'YourGitHubUsername' with your actual GitHub username.

3. This should clone your repository and load the StoneRDF project into your Pharo image.

4. To verify that the project loaded correctly:
   - Open the System Browser (Tools > System Browser, or Ctrl+O+B)
   - Look for the 'StoneRDF-Core' and 'StoneRDF-Tests' packages in the package list

5. You can now start using your StoneRDF library. Try running some code in the Playground to test it out.

6. To save your changes, use the 'Save' option from the World menu or press Ctrl+S.

Remember, you're now working within the Pharo environment. Any changes you make here will be local to your Pharo image until you commit and push them back to your GitHub repository.

Q1: How can we use the Pharo tools to explore and modify the StoneRDF classes?
Q2: What's the best way to run and debug the tests for StoneRDF within Pharo?
Q3: How can we use Iceberg (Pharo's Git client) to manage our project and push changes back to GitHub?
