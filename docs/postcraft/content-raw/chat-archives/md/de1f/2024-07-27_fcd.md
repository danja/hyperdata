 Thank you for providing that information. It looks like you've successfully downloaded and set up Pharo 12 on your Linux system. Now, let's proceed with getting your StoneRDF project into this Pharo environment.

1. Start Pharo:
   Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   ./pharo-ui Pharo.image
   ```

2. Once Pharo is running, open a Playground (Ctrl+O+W or from the World menu).

3. In the Playground, execute the following Metacello script to load your project:
   ```smalltalk
   Metacello new
     baseline: 'StoneRDF';
     repository: 'github://YourGitHubUsername/StoneRDF:main';
     load.
   ```
   Replace 'YourGitHubUsername' with your actual GitHub username.

4. This should clone your repository and load the StoneRDF project into your Pharo image.

5. To verify that the project loaded correctly, open the System Browser (Ctrl+O+B) and look for the 'StoneRDF-Core' and 'StoneRDF-Tests' packages.

6. You can now start using your StoneRDF library. Try running some code in the Playground, for example:
   ```smalltalk
   store := RDFStore new.
   subject := RDFResource uri: 'http://example.org/Alice'.
   predicate := RDFProperty uri: 'http://example.org/knows'.
   object := RDFResource uri: 'http://example.org/Bob'.
   triple := RDFTriple subject: subject predicate: predicate object: object.
   store addTriple: triple.
   store triplesDo: [:t | Transcript show: t; cr].
   ```

7. To save your changes, use the 'Save' option from the World menu or press Ctrl+S.

Remember, any changes you make to the code in Pharo will be local to your image. To contribute changes back to your GitHub repository, you'll need to commit and push from within Pharo using Iceberg (Pharo's Git client) or export the code and commit using your regular Git workflow.

Q1: How can we set up Iceberg in Pharo to manage our StoneRDF project directly?
Q2: What's the best way to run the tests for our StoneRDF project in Pharo?
Q3: How can we create a new release of StoneRDF once we've made some changes?
