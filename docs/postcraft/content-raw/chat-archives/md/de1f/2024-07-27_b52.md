 You're right, and I apologize for suggesting such a tedious method. There is indeed a quicker way to load this code into a Pharo image:

1. Use Iceberg, Pharo's Git client, to clone the repository directly into your Pharo image.

2. If the repository is properly structured as a Pharo project, you can load it using Metacello.

Here's a step-by-step process:

1. Open your Pharo image.

2. Open a Playground.

3. Execute the following Metacello script (adjust the repository URL as needed):

```smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'StoneRDF';
  repository: 'github://YourGitHubUsername/StoneRDF:main';
  load.
```

This script assumes that the project has a proper baseline defined. If it doesn't, you'll need to create one.

4. If the repository doesn't have a baseline yet, you can still clone it using Iceberg:

   - Open Iceberg from the World menu.
   - Click "Add" and choose "Clone from GitHub"
   - Enter the repository details and click OK.

5. Once cloned, you can load the packages manually from Iceberg.

This method is much faster and more maintainable than copying and pasting individual files.

Q1: How can we create a proper baseline for this StoneRDF project?
Q2: What are the best practices for organizing Smalltalk code in a Git repository for easy loading into Pharo?
Q3: How can we set up continuous integration for this project to ensure it loads correctly in different Pharo versions?
