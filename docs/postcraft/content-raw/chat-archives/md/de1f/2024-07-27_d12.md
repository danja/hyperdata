 That's great news! Since you already have the repository cloned on your local filesystem, we can use that to load your project into Pharo. This approach bypasses the SSL issues you encountered. Here's how to proceed:

1. Open a Playground in Pharo (Ctrl+O+W or World menu > Tools > Playground).

2. In the Playground, enter the following code, replacing '/path/to/your/local/clone' with the actual path to your locally cloned repository:

   ```smalltalk
   Metacello new
     baseline: 'StoneRDF';
     repository: 'gitlocal:///path/to/your/local/clone';
     load.
   ```

3. Select the code and execute it (Ctrl+D or right-click and choose "Do it").

This should load your StoneRDF project into the Pharo image from your local clone, avoiding the SSL error.

After loading, you can verify that the project is loaded correctly:

4. Open the System Browser (Ctrl+O+B or World menu > Tools > System Browser).

5. Look for the 'StoneRDF-Core' and 'StoneRDF-Tests' packages in the package list.

If you see these packages, your project has been successfully loaded.

Now that your project is loaded, you can start working on it within Pharo. Remember that changes made in Pharo won't automatically update your local Git repository. You'll need to manually commit and push changes using your regular Git workflow outside of Pharo.

Q1: Would you like to know how to explore and modify your StoneRDF classes within Pharo now that they're loaded?
Q2: Are you interested in setting up Iceberg to manage your project directly from within Pharo for future development?
Q3: Would you like to learn how to run the tests for your StoneRDF project within the Pharo environment?
