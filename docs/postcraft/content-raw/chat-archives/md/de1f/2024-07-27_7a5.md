 The error you're seeing is an SSL error, which suggests there's an issue with the secure connection to GitHub when trying to clone your repository. This could be due to several reasons:

1. SSL certificate issues: Your system might not have up-to-date root certificates.
2. Network issues: There might be a firewall or proxy interfering with the connection.
3. Git configuration: Your local Git might not be properly configured for SSL connections.

Here are some steps you can try to resolve this:

1. Update your system's SSL certificates:
   On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ca-certificates`
   On Fedora/CentOS: `sudo yum update ca-certificates`

2. Check your Git configuration:
   Run `git config --global http.sslVerify true`

3. If you're behind a proxy, ensure it's correctly configured in Git:
   ```
   git config --global http.proxy http://proxyuser:proxypwd@proxy.server.com:8080
   ```

4. Try cloning the repository manually outside of Pharo:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/StoneRDF.git
   ```
   If this works, you can try loading the project from the local clone.

5. If all else fails, you might need to temporarily disable SSL verification (not recommended for security reasons):
   ```
   git config --global http.sslVerify false
   ```

After trying these steps, restart Pharo and attempt to load the project again.

Q1: Are you able to access GitHub through a web browser on the same machine?
Q2: Have you successfully used Iceberg to clone other GitHub repositories in Pharo before?
Q3: Would you like to try an alternative method to load your project, such as downloading it as a ZIP and loading it locally?
