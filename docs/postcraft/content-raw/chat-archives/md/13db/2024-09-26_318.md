 Upper ontologies are high-level, domain-independent ontologies that provide a framework for more specific domain ontologies. They aim to capture the most general and abstract concepts that can be applied across various fields of knowledge. Here are some notable upper ontologies:

1. Basic Formal Ontology (BFO): 
Developed by Barry Smith and his colleagues, BFO is widely used in scientific and biomedical domains. It distinguishes between continuants (objects) and occurrents (processes).

2. DOLCE (Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering):
Created by Nicola Guarino and his team, DOLCE focuses on cognitive bias and is intended for organizing information in natural language and human commonsense.

3. SUMO (Suggested Upper Merged Ontology):
One of the largest publicly available ontologies, SUMO was created by Ian Niles and Adam Pease. It's been mapped to the entire WordNet lexicon.

4. Cyc:
Developed by Cycorp, Cyc aims to encode human common sense knowledge. It includes both an upper ontology and a vast knowledge base of facts.

5. GFO (General Formal Ontology):
Created at the University of Leipzig, GFO integrates object and process perspectives and includes levels of reality and complex categories.

6. UMBEL (Upper Mapping and Binding Exchange Layer):
Based on OpenCyc, UMBEL is designed to help content interoperate on the Web.

7. UFO (Unified Foundational Ontology):
Developed by Giancarlo Guizzardi and colleagues, UFO is used in conceptual modeling and has been applied in areas like software engineering and enterprise modeling.

These upper ontologies serve different purposes and have varying levels of adoption in different fields. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific one or discuss how they're used in practice?
