 Creating your own upper ontology that's consistent with existing ones is an ambitious and intellectually stimulating project. It's a great way to synthesize different approaches and potentially address gaps or limitations in current upper ontologies. Here are some thoughts on how you might approach this:

1. Comparative Analysis:
First, conduct a thorough comparative analysis of the existing upper ontologies. Look for common themes, divergences, and unique strengths of each.

2. Identify Core Concepts:
Determine the core concepts that appear across multiple ontologies. These might form the backbone of your ontology.

3. Use OWL2 Features:
Leverage OWL2's features to create a flexible and expressive ontology. Consider using:

   - Class hierarchies
   - Object and data properties
   - Axioms for complex relationships
   - Annotations for metadata

4. Modularization:
Consider a modular approach, where you create separate modules that can be combined. This could allow users to include only the parts they need.

5. Mapping to Existing Ontologies:
Create mappings to existing ontologies using OWL2's equivalence and subsumption axioms. This enhances interoperability.

6. Documentation:
Provide thorough documentation, including the rationale behind your design decisions.

Would you like me to create a basic structure for your ontology, showing how you might start integrating concepts from different upper ontologies using OWL2?
