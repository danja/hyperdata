 Yes, John Sowa has indeed specified his own upper-level ontology. Sowa is a computer scientist known for his work in knowledge representation, conceptual graphs, and ontology.

<antThinking>John Sowa's upper ontology is a substantial and self-contained piece of work that could benefit from being presented as an artifact. It's complex enough to warrant its own space and might be something a user would want to reference or study further. I'll create a new artifact to present this information.</antThinking>

# John Sowa's Upper Ontology

John Sowa has developed an upper-level ontology that is often referred to as "Sowa's Ontology" or "Sowa's Top-Level Categories." This ontology is based on his work in knowledge representation and conceptual graphs.

## Key Features:

1. **Triadic Structure**: Sowa's ontology is organized into three main categories:
   - Independent
   - Relative
   - Mediating

2. **Subcategories**: Each of these main categories is further divided into seven subcategories:
   - Physical
   - Abstract
   - Actuality
   - Form
   - Prehension
   - Intention
   - Nexus

3. **Lattice Structure**: The categories are arranged in a lattice, allowing for multiple inheritance and flexible categorization.

4. **Philosophy-Inspired**: Sowa's work draws inspiration from various philosophical traditions, including Peirce's phenomenology and Whitehead's process philosophy.

5. **Extensibility**: The ontology is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of more specific categories as needed for particular domains.

## Example Categories:

- Physical Independent: Object
- Abstract Form: Schema
- Physical Mediating: Process
- Abstract Relative: Relation

This ontology serves as a framework for organizing and representing knowledge across various domains, providing a high-level structure that can be specialized for more specific applications.

John Sowa has indeed specified his own upper ontology, which is often referred to as "Sowa's Ontology" or "Sowa's Top-Level Categories." I've created an artifact with more detailed information about his ontology.

Key points about Sowa's upper ontology:

1. It has a triadic structure with three main categories: Independent, Relative, and Mediating.
2. Each main category is further divided into seven subcategories.
3. The ontology is arranged in a lattice structure, allowing for multiple inheritance.
4. It's influenced by various philosophical traditions.
5. The ontology is designed to be extensible for specific domain applications.

Sowa's work is significant in the field of knowledge representation and has influenced many subsequent ontology efforts. His approach aims to provide a flexible yet comprehensive framework for categorizing entities and relationships across various domains of knowledge.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of Sowa's ontology or compare it to other upper ontologies we discussed earlier?
