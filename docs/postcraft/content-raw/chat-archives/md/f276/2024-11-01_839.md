I've got to a point where I have to run `src/applications/postcraft/transmissions.ttl` against a whole bunch of different sets of source material to render them. It's already very long. I think I made a start in the code at making them more modular, so one `transmissions.ttl` could set another subroutine `transmissions.ttl` in motion. But I can't remember how farI got. Can you please review the code for me, what there is already towards acheiving this, suggest potential next steps towards implementing it.
