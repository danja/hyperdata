 Based on the spectrogram and your description, it seems you've created a simple pan pipe-like instrument from a piece of cane. To improve its playability and reduce breathiness while maintaining its character, you could try:

1. Smoothing the blowing edge: Carefully sand or file the edge where you blow to create a sharper, more defined edge. This can help produce a clearer tone with less air noise.

2. Adjusting the pipe length: Experiment with slightly shortening the pipe to find the optimal length for easier playing. This may also affect the pitch.

3. Sealing any leaks: Check for and seal any small cracks or holes along the length of the cane to improve air efficiency.

4. Shaping the mouthpiece: Slightly flattening or angling the area where you blow can help direct the air more efficiently across the opening.

5. Experimenting with embouchure: Practice different lip positions and blowing techniques to find what produces the best tone with your instrument.

6. Adding a fipple: While this would change the instrument type slightly, adding a simple fipple (like in a recorder) could make it easier to play and potentially reduce breathiness.

7. Internal bore adjustment: Carefully smoothing the inside of the pipe near the opening might help reduce turbulence and breathiness.

Remember to make small, gradual changes and test frequently to maintain the pan pipe quality you enjoy while improving its playability.
