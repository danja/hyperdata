 I apologize, but I don't have the capability to create, format, or generate PDF files directly. As an AI language model, I can only provide text-based information and responses.

However, I can suggest a few ways you could turn this information into a printable format:

1. Copy and paste the text into a word processing program like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Pages, and then format it as you like before saving or exporting as a PDF.

2. Use a free online tool that converts text to PDF. You could copy the text I provided and paste it into one of these tools.

3. If you're comfortable with basic HTML and CSS, you could create a simple webpage with this content and then use your browser's print-to-PDF function.

4. You could also use a note-taking app that allows PDF export, such as Evernote or OneNote.

Remember to adjust the formatting as needed to fit everything onto one page. If you need any clarification on the content or have questions about how to format it effectively, please let me know and I'll be happy to help further.
