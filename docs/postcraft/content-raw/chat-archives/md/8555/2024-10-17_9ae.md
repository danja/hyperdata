 You're right to be cautious about granting write access to your GitHub repositories. Open Collective's authentication system using GitHub does indeed request broad permissions by default. However, there are a few options you might consider:

1. Limited scope authorization: When you sign in with GitHub, you should be able to choose which repositories you want to grant access to. You can select only public repositories or specific ones, rather than granting access to all your repositories.

2. Create a separate GitHub account: You could create a new GitHub account specifically for use with Open Collective, which wouldn't have access to your main repositories.

3. Use an alternative sign-up method: Open Collective usually offers other ways to sign up, such as using an email address or other social media accounts. Check if these options are available to you.

4. Revoke access after signing up: If you do sign up using GitHub, you can later revoke Open Collective's access to your repositories:
   - Go to your GitHub account settings
   - Navigate to "Applications"
   - Find Open Collective in the list and click "Revoke Access"

5. Contact Open Collective: You could reach out to Open Collective's support team to ask if they have any alternatives for users concerned about granting write access.

It's worth noting that while Open Collective requests write access, they may not actually use it. Many platforms request broader access than they need as a blanket policy. However, it's always good to be cautious with your data and access permissions.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these options or provide more information about managing GitHub permissions?
