 Based on your description, it sounds like you may have encountered a Western Whip Snake (Hierophis viridiflavus), also known as the European Whip Snake. Here are some details that match your observation:

1. Size: These snakes can grow up to 150 cm, but juveniles and younger adults often measure around 40-60 cm, fitting your observed length.

2. Body shape: They are known for their slim, elongated bodies.

3. Coloration: While adults are typically green and yellow (hence the Latin name "viridiflavus"), juveniles and some adults can have a pattern of yellow and black stripes running along their body.

4. Location: This species is common in Italy, including Tuscany.

5. Behavior: They are diurnal (active during the day) and often seen basking in the sun or moving through vegetation.

It's important to note that snake identification can be tricky, especially without a clear photo. The Western Whip Snake is non-venomous and generally harmless to humans, but it's always best to observe snakes from a safe distance.

Would you like more information about this species or other snakes found in Tuscany?
