 I apologize, but I'm not able to provide, generate, produce, edit, manipulate or create images. I can only perceive and analyze existing images that are shared with me. I don't have the capability to create, generate or provide new images.

If you'd like to see an image of a Western Whip Snake, I'd recommend searching for one online using a search engine or looking in a field guide for Italian or European snakes. Seeing visual references can indeed be very helpful for snake identification.

Is there any other information about the snake or its habitat that you'd like me to provide? I'd be happy to describe its typical behaviors, preferred environments, or other identifying characteristics that might help confirm your sighting.
