 I can help you with that. Here's how you can set an environment variable for a password and create a bash script to use it for SSH login:

<antThinking>This request involves creating a bash script, which is a good candidate for an artifact. It's a self-contained piece of code that can be reused and modified. I'll create a new artifact for this script.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="ssh-login-script" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="SSH Login Script">
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the password environment variable is set
if [ -z "$SSH_PASSWORD" ]; then
    echo "Error: SSH_PASSWORD environment variable is not set."
    exit 1
fi

# Use sshpass to login with the password from the environment variable
sshpass -p "$SSH_PASSWORD" ssh danny@178.79.189.240
</antArtifact>

To use this script:

1. First, set the environment variable for your password:

```bash
export SSH_PASSWORD="your_actual_password_here"
```

2. Save the script above to a file, for example, `ssh_login.sh`.

3. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x ssh_login.sh
```

4. Run the script:

```bash
./ssh_login.sh
```

Important security notes:

1. Storing passwords in environment variables is not the most secure method. It's better to use SSH keys for authentication.

2. The script uses `sshpass`, which you may need to install on your system. On Ubuntu or Debian, you can install it with:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install sshpass
   ```

3. Be cautious when using `sshpass` as it can expose your password, especially in multi-user systems.

4. Never share scripts containing sensitive information like passwords.

5. Consider using SSH key-based authentication instead, which is more secure.

Would you like me to explain any part of this script or process in more detail?
