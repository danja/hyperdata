 For detecting cold spots and drafts in a room, consider these sensors:

1. Thermistor array: Multiple thermistors placed around the robot to measure temperature gradients.
2. Infrared thermometer: Non-contact temperature measurement of surfaces.
3. Anemometer: Measures air velocity to detect drafts.
4. Humidity sensor: Can help identify areas of moisture that may correlate with cold spots.
5. Differential pressure sensor: Detects air pressure changes indicative of drafts.

Focus on thermistors and infrared thermometers for temperature sensing, combined with an anemometer for draft detection. This combination provides a cost-effective solution for identifying cold spots and air movements.

Q1: What are the pros and cons of using thermistors versus RTDs for this application?
Q2: How would you arrange multiple sensors on the robot to optimize cold spot detection?
Q3: What challenges might arise in calibrating and interpreting data from these sensors in a home environment?
