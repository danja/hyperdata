 IR thermometers:
Inexpensive options exist, such as the MLX90614 or TMP006/TMP007 sensors. These provide non-contact temperature measurement in a small, affordable package.

Characteristics:
- Range: Typically -70°C to 380°C
- Resolution: 0.02°C to 0.5°C, depending on model
- Field of view: 5° to 90°, narrower FOV increases accuracy for pinpoint measurements

Multiple sensor setup:
1. Array of fixed sensors for simultaneous multi-point measurement
2. Single sensor on pan-tilt servo mechanism for scanning
3. Combine fixed and movable sensors for comprehensive coverage

Integration:
Use I2C or SPI interfaces for easy connection to microcontrollers. Implement scanning patterns to create thermal maps of the environment.

Signal processing techniques for improved sensitivity:
1. Oversampling and averaging to reduce noise
2. Kalman filtering for more accurate temperature estimation
3. Median filtering to remove outliers
4. Adaptive thresholding for detecting significant temperature changes

Comprehensive draft detection system:
1. IR thermometers for surface temperature mapping
2. Thermistor array for ambient temperature gradients
3. Hot-wire anemometer for air movement detection
4. Humidity sensor to correlate moisture with temperature variations

Q1: How would you design a scanning pattern to efficiently map a room's thermal profile?
Q2: What methods could be used to differentiate between drafts and normal temperature variations in a room?
Q3: How might machine learning be applied to improve the system's ability to identify and characterize cold spots over time?
