 I apologize for the confusion. The error you're seeing is because `webpack` is not imported in your configuration file. Since you're using ES modules, you'll need to import webpack slightly differently. Here's how you can modify your webpack.config.js:

```javascript
import { ProvidePlugin } from 'webpack';
import path from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

export default {
  // ... other config
  plugins: [
    new ProvidePlugin({
      process: 'process/browser'
    }),
  ],
  resolve: {
    fallback: {
      "process": require.resolve("process/browser")
    }
  },
  // ... rest of your config
};
```

Make sure you've installed webpack as a dev dependency:

```
npm install --save-dev webpack
```

If you're still encountering issues, you might want to consider switching to CommonJS for your webpack config. To do this, rename your file to `webpack.config.cjs` and use this structure:

```javascript
const webpack = require('webpack');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  // ... other config
  plugins: [
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
      process: 'process/browser'
    }),
  ],
  resolve: {
    fallback: {
      "process": require.resolve("process/browser")
    }
  },
  // ... rest of your config
};
```

Q1: Are you using any other build tools or task runners alongside Webpack?

Q2: Have you considered using Webpack 5's built-in Node.js polyfills instead of manually adding them?

Q3: Would you like to see an example of a complete Webpack configuration that addresses common Node.js compatibility issues in the browser?
