 Excellent question. In fact, forward-only conditional branching is sufficient to achieve Turing completeness, as long as you have the ability to loop or recurse. Here's why:

1. Forward-only branching + looping:
With forward-only branching and the ability to loop, you can simulate backward jumps by wrapping your entire sequence in a loop and using forward jumps to "restart" the sequence. For example:

```
WHILE true DO
  A
  B
  C
  IF condition THEN CONTINUE
  D
  E
  F
END WHILE
```

In this structure, the `IF condition THEN CONTINUE` acts like a "GOTO A" by skipping the rest of the loop body and starting over from the beginning.

2. Structured programming theorem:
This concept is formally supported by the structured programming theorem (also known as the BÃ¶hm-Jacopini theorem). It states that any algorithm can be expressed using just three control structures:

- Sequence
- Selection (if/then/else)
- Iteration (while loops)

Notably, this doesn't require arbitrary GOTO statements, which would allow backward jumps.

3. Practical implementation:
In practice, forward-only branching is often preferred in programming languages because it's easier to reason about and less prone to creating "spaghetti code". Many modern languages (like Python, Java, etc.) don't even have a GOTO statement, yet they are Turing complete.

So, to answer your question directly: forward-only branching is indeed adequate to achieve Turing completeness, as long as you also have the ability to loop or recurse. The ability to jump backwards in the sequence is not necessary.

Would you like me to provide an example of how you might implement this forward-only branching in your function sequence system?
