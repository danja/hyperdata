 To make your system of sequentially applying functions Turing complete, you need to add two key elements:

1. Conditional branching
2. The ability to loop or recurse

Here's a brief explanation of why these are necessary and how you might implement them:

1. Conditional branching:
This allows the program to make decisions based on the current state. You could implement this by adding an if-else type of construct. For example:

```
IF condition THEN A B C ELSE D E F
```

This would apply A(B(C(O))) if the condition is true, and D(E(F(O))) if it's false.

2. Looping or recursion:
This allows the program to repeat a set of operations, which is crucial for handling arbitrary amounts of data or computation. You could implement this with a WHILE loop or a recursive call. For example:

```
WHILE condition DO A B C
```

This would repeatedly apply A(B(C(O))) as long as the condition is true.

With these additions, your system would become Turing complete, capable of computing anything that a Turing machine can compute. The arbitrary object O could serve as your "tape" or memory, and the functions could read from and write to this object.

Would you like me to elaborate on how you might implement these features in a specific programming language or paradigm?
