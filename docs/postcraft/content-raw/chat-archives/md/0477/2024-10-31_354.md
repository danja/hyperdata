 I don't know about LangGraph.js specifically. I can help with JavaScript workflows, state machines, and language processing patterns which appear to be related to LangGraph's domain.

Q1: Would you like to explore alternative JavaScript libraries for building conversational/LLM workflows?

Q2: Are you interested in implementing a state machine for language processing in vanilla JavaScript?

Q3: What specific language processing or workflow orchestration features are you looking to implement?

Q4: Would you like to look at how to integrate with LangChain.js for similar functionality?
