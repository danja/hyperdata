 I understand you want the script to run in a browser. In that case, we need to approach this differently, as browser environments don't have access to Node.js modules like 'fs/promises'. Here's what we need to do:

1. Remove or replace any Node.js specific modules in your code. For 'fs/promises', you'll need to find a browser-compatible alternative or restructure your code to not rely on file system operations.

2. Update your webpack.config.mjs:

```javascript
import path from 'path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

export default {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  target: 'web', // Change this to 'web'
  // Remove the externals configuration
  resolve: {
    extensions: ['.js', '.json'],
  },
};
```

3. In your src/index.js, replace any Node.js specific code. For example, instead of reading files with 'fs/promises', you might need to fetch data from an API or load it another way.

4. If you're using other Node.js specific modules, you'll need to find browser-compatible alternatives for those as well.

After making these changes, try running `npm run build` again.

Q1: What specific functionality were you using 'fs/promises' for in your browser script?
Q2: Are there any other Node.js specific modules you're using that we need to address?
Q3: Do you need to handle any file operations in the browser, or can that functionality be moved to a server-side component?
