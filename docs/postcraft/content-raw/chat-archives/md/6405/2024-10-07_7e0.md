 One simple CBT practice that could be beneficial for adult ADHD with minimal effort is the "5-4-3-2-1" grounding technique. This exercise can help improve focus, reduce anxiety, and bring your attention to the present moment. Here's how it works:

Whenever you feel overwhelmed, distracted, or need to refocus:

1. Acknowledge 5 things you can see around you
2. Acknowledge 4 things you can touch or feel
3. Acknowledge 3 things you can hear
4. Acknowledge 2 things you can smell
5. Acknowledge 1 thing you can taste

This technique requires no preparation and can be done anywhere, anytime. It helps interrupt racing thoughts and brings your attention to your immediate environment, which can be particularly helpful for individuals with ADHD.

To make it even easier to implement, you could start with just the first step (noticing 5 things you can see) and gradually add the other senses as you become more comfortable with the practice.

Would you like more information on how to incorporate this into your daily routine?
