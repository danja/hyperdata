 Yes, there are libraries that can bridge the gap between SPARQL/RDF and GraphQL. Here are a few notable options:

1. HyperGraphQL (https://github.com/hypergraphql/hypergraphql)
   - Translates GraphQL queries to SPARQL
   - Allows querying RDF data sources via GraphQL

2. GraphQL-LD (https://github.com/rubensworks/graphql-ld.js)
   - Converts GraphQL-LD queries to SPARQL
   - Focuses on Linked Data querying

3. TopBraid GraphQL (commercial)
   - Provides GraphQL interface to RDF data

These libraries offer varying levels of translation and integration between SPARQL/RDF and GraphQL ecosystems.

Q1: Are you looking to query existing RDF data sources using GraphQL syntax?
Q2: Do you need bidirectional translation, or is one-way (e.g., GraphQL to SPARQL) sufficient?
Q3: Is support for specific RDF serializations (e.g., Turtle, N-Triples) important for your use case?
