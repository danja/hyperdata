 Here's a comparison of HyperGraphQL and GraphQL-LD:

HyperGraphQL:
Pros:
1. Full GraphQL to SPARQL translation
2. Supports multiple RDF data sources
3. Extensible architecture

Cons:
1. Less active development recently
2. Steeper learning curve
3. Requires Java runtime

GraphQL-LD:
Pros:
1. Lightweight and JavaScript-based
2. Focuses on Linked Data principles
3. More active development

Cons:
1. More limited in scope compared to HyperGraphQL
2. Primarily for querying, less focus on full SPARQL features
3. May require more custom logic for complex use cases

Both have their strengths, with HyperGraphQL offering more comprehensive translation and GraphQL-LD providing a more focused, JS-friendly approach.

Q1: Is Java runtime compatibility a concern for your project?
Q2: How important is having a pure JavaScript solution?
Q3: Do you need to support complex SPARQL features, or are basic query translations sufficient?
