 The GraphQL part of Octokit is indeed focused on GitHub's GraphQL API, but it can serve as a good starting point for more general GraphQL interactions. Here's a brief analysis:

1. Octokit's GraphQL support:
   - Tailored for GitHub's GraphQL API
   - Provides convenient methods for GitHub-specific operations

2. Reusability for other GraphQL endpoints:
   - Core concepts and request handling are transferable
   - GitHub-specific features would need to be abstracted away

For more general GraphQL use, consider:

1. graphql-request: Lightweight, flexible GraphQL client
2. Apollo Client: Full-featured GraphQL client with caching

These are more agnostic and could be better for building general-purpose GraphQL processors.

Q1: Are you planning to interact with multiple GraphQL APIs beyond GitHub?
Q2: Do you need advanced features like caching or state management in your GraphQL interactions?
Q3: How important is minimizing the learning curve across different API interactions in your project?
