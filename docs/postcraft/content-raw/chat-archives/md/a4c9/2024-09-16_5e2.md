 "pali wan. pana tu." in Toki Pona translates to English as:

"Work one. Give two."

Breaking it down:

1. "pali" means "to do, to make, to work"
2. "wan" means "one"
3. "pana" means "to give, to send, to emit"
4. "tu" means "two"

The period in the middle separates two sentences or phrases.

This phrase could be interpreted as a proverb or saying, possibly meaning something like "Work once, give twice" or "Do one, share two." It might imply the idea of being generous or productive - that from a single effort, one should aim to provide double the output or benefit.

However, it's important to note that Toki Pona is a minimalist language designed for simplicity, and its words can have broad meanings. The exact interpretation can depend on context and the speaker's intent.
