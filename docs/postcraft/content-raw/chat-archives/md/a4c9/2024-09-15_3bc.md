 Wind direction is typically reported as the direction from which the wind is blowing. So when you hear a wind direction like NNE (North-Northeast), it means the wind is coming from that direction.

To remember this, you can think of it as the wind's origin or source. For example:

- A north wind blows from north to south
- An east wind blows from east to west
- An NNE wind blows from north-northeast towards south-southwest

This convention is used in weather reports, sailing, and other activities where wind direction is important. It allows people to quickly understand where the wind is coming from and how it might affect their activities or local conditions.
