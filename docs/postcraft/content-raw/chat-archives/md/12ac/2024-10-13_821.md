 I have analyzed the question and identified key concepts and components required for a solution. I have broken down the problem into small steps and individual tasks needed to reach the goal.

One-line summaries of tasks:
1. Identify the source of the "Unsupported operation: Symbol(define-macro)" error.
2. Analyze the evaluator.js file for define-macro implementation.
3. Investigate the interpreter.js file for macro handling.
4. Propose a solution to implement define-macro functionality.

Solution description:
The error occurs due to missing define-macro functionality in the Sheltopusik interpreter. To resolve this, implement a define-macro handler in the evaluator.js file, update the interpreter.js to recognize macro definitions, and modify the evaluation process to expand macros before execution.

q1: What is the purpose of define-macro in Lisp-like languages?
q2: How does macro expansion typically work in interpreted languages?
q3: Are there any potential drawbacks to implementing macros in Sheltopusik?
q4: What alternatives to macros could be considered for code generation or syntax extension?
