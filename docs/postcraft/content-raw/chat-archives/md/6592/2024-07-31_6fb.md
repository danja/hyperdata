 The most widely supported method for including non-visible comments in Markdown is using HTML comment syntax. This approach works because most Markdown processors are designed to pass through HTML unchanged, including HTML comments.

Here's how you can use HTML comments in Markdown:

```markdown
<!-- This is a comment that won't be visible in the rendered output -->

Regular Markdown text here.

<!-- 
You can also have
multi-line comments
like this
-->
```

Key points about this method:

1. Wide support: This method works across most Markdown flavors and processors.

2. Invisibility: These comments won't appear in the rendered output (e.g., HTML or PDF).

3. Usefulness: It's great for leaving notes for collaborators or yourself, or for temporarily "commenting out" sections of content.

4. Limitations: While invisible in rendered output, these comments are visible to anyone who can access the raw Markdown source.

It's worth noting that some specialized Markdown editors or platforms might offer their own commenting systems, but the HTML comment method is the most universally supported across different Markdown implementations.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of using comments in Markdown?
