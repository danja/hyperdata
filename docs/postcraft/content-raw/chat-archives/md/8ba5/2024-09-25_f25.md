 Ludwig II of Bavaria, also known as "Ludwig the Mad" or the "Fairy Tale King," was the King of Bavaria from 1864 to 1886. He's a fascinating historical figure known for his eccentricities, artistic patronage, and the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death. Here are some key points about him:

1. Early Life: Born in 1845, Ludwig became king at the young age of 18 following his father's death.

2. Artistic Patron: He was a great patron of the arts, most famously supporting the composer Richard Wagner.

3. Castle Builder: Ludwig is renowned for commissioning the construction of several elaborate castles, including:
   - Neuschwanstein Castle (which later inspired Disney's Sleeping Beauty Castle)
   - Linderhof Palace
   - Herrenchiemsee Palace (modeled after Versailles)

4. Eccentricities: He was known for his night-time sleigh rides, elaborate dinners for imaginary guests, and his desire to live in a fantasy world of medieval legends.

5. Political Withdrawal: As he aged, Ludwig became increasingly reclusive and withdrew from his governmental duties, focusing instead on his artistic and architectural projects.

6. Mental State: There was much speculation about his mental health, with some contemporaries describing him as "mad." Modern historians debate the accuracy of this assessment.

7. Deposition and Death: In 1886, he was declared unfit to rule and was deposed. Shortly after, he died under mysterious circumstances in Lake Starnberg, along with the psychiatrist who had declared him insane.

8. Legacy: Today, Ludwig II is remembered more fondly in Bavaria. His castles are major tourist attractions, and he's seen as a romantic figure who brought significant cultural and economic benefits to the region.

Ludwig II's life continues to fascinate historians and the public, blending elements of fairy tale grandeur with the complexities of 19th-century politics and changing societal norms. His story raises interesting questions about the nature of power, artistry, and mental health in historical context.
