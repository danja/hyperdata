 Lucca's governance during its time as a city-state was complex and changed over the centuries. Here's an overview of its rulers and forms of government:

1. Early Period (12th-13th centuries):
   - Initially ruled by Marquises, then became a commune with consuls.
   - In 1160, it gained independence as a republic.

2. Oligarchic Republic (13th-14th centuries):
   - Governed by wealthy merchant families.
   - Key institutions included the General Council and the Council of Elders.

3. Castracani Era (1316-1328):
   - Castruccio Castracani ruled as Lord of Lucca.
   - He expanded Lucca's territory significantly.

4. Period of Foreign Control (14th century):
   - Brief periods of rule by Pisa, Florence, and others.
   - John of Bohemia briefly held control.

5. Return to Republican Rule (1370):
   - Lucca regained independence.
   - Governed by a Gonfaloniere (chief magistrate) and a Council of Elders.

6. Guinigi Signoria (1400-1430):
   - Paolo Guinigi ruled as Lord of Lucca.

7. Oligarchic Republic (1430-1799):
   - Return to republican government.
   - Ruled by a small group of noble families.
   - Key governing body was the Council of Thirty-Six.

8. Late Period:
   - Brief French occupation during Napoleonic wars.
   - In 1805, became a principality under Elisa Bonaparte Baciocchi, Napoleon's sister.

Key Points:
- Lucca maintained independence longer than many Italian city-states.
- It alternated between republican forms of government and periods of signoria (lordship).
- The city was often ruled by its wealthy merchant class rather than a single family dynasty.
- Lucca's government was generally more stable and less prone to faction fighting than some other Italian city-states.

Lucca's ability to maintain independence and relative stability for so long was due to a combination of economic prosperity, strategic diplomacy, and effective governance structures that evolved over time.
