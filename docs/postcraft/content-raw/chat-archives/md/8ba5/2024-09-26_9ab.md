 I apologize, but I don't have direct access to the Federated Wiki (FedWiki) core source code or its plugins. As an AI language model, I don't have the ability to browse or check source code repositories in real-time. However, I can provide you with some general guidance on how you might approach creating a plugin for FedWiki to use a remote SPARQL server as a store.

To create such a plugin, you'd likely need to:

1. Understand FedWiki's plugin architecture
2. Study existing storage-related plugins
3. Implement SPARQL querying functionality
4. Integrate with FedWiki's data model

Here are some steps you could take:

1. Examine FedWiki's GitHub repository:
   - Look for the main repository: https://github.com/fedwiki/wiki
   - Check the 'plugins' directory for examples

2. Look for existing storage plugins:
   - Search for terms like "store", "database", or "persistence" in the plugin directory

3. Study the plugin development documentation:
   - FedWiki likely has documentation on how to create plugins

4. Investigate any existing RDF or linked data plugins:
   - These might provide insights on working with semantic data

5. Understand FedWiki's data model:
   - How pages and their contents are structured
   - How this might map to an RDF/SPARQL model

6. Implement SPARQL functionality:
   - Use a SPARQL client library for Node.js (assuming FedWiki uses Node.js)
   - Create functions to translate between FedWiki's data model and SPARQL queries/results

7. Integrate with FedWiki's plugin system:
   - Implement necessary hooks for saving and retrieving data
   - Ensure your plugin conforms to FedWiki's plugin architecture

Without direct access to the source code, I can't point you to specific files or functions. However, these general steps should help you get started. You might want to reach out to the FedWiki community or check their documentation for more specific guidance on plugin development.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these steps or discuss how you might approach mapping FedWiki's data model to a SPARQL-based system?
