 The T-Watch-2020 V1 uses a 1.54-inch TFT LCD display. Here are the key details about the display and available interface libraries:

Display Specifications:
- Size: 1.54 inches
- Resolution: 240 x 240 pixels
- Type: IPS LCD
- Driver: ST7789V

Interface Libraries:
1. TFT_eSPI: This is a popular and widely used library for ESP32 devices with TFT displays. It's optimized for performance and supports the ST7789V driver used in the T-Watch-2020 V1.

2. LovyanGFX: Another high-performance graphics library that supports multiple display drivers, including the ST7789V.

3. LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library): A powerful open-source graphics library that can be used with the T-Watch. It provides a higher level of abstraction and more advanced UI elements.

4. TTGO_TWatch_Library: This is a specific library developed for the T-Watch series. It includes drivers for various components of the watch, including the display.

5. Adafruit GFX Library: While not specifically designed for the T-Watch, this library can be adapted to work with its display and provides a good set of graphics primitives.

When working with the T-Watch-2020 V1, many developers use the TFT_eSPI or TTGO_TWatch_Library as they are well-suited for this specific hardware. The choice often depends on the complexity of your project and your familiarity with the libraries.

Would you like more information on how to set up or use any of these libraries with your T-Watch-2020 V1?
