 In Italian, the name Pierre (which is French) is typically spelled as "Piero."

"Piero" is the Italian equivalent of Pierre, both derived from the name Peter (which comes from the Greek Petros, meaning "rock" or "stone"). 

It's worth noting that while "Piero" is the standard Italian spelling, you might occasionally see variations such as:

1. Pietro - Another common Italian form of Peter
2. Pier - Sometimes used as a shortened form, especially in compound names

However, "Piero" remains the most direct Italian equivalent to the French "Pierre."
