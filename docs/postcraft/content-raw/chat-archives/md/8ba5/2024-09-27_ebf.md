 Certainly! I'll modify the SVG to include a simple stick figure person in the doorway. This addition will make the logo more dynamic and representative of the idea of a person sharing content from their own space.

<antThinking>I need to update the existing SVG by adding a stick figure in the doorway. This will be an update to the previous artifact, maintaining the same identifier.</antThinking>

I've added a simple stick figure person in the doorway of the house. Here's a breakdown of the changes:

1. The existing elements (house shape, door, and Wi-Fi signals) remain the same.
2. A new stick figure has been added, consisting of:
   - A circle for the head
   - Lines for the body, arms, and legs

The stick figure is colored in the same blue as the house (#4A90E2) to maintain color harmony and make it clear that the person is part of the "home" concept.

This addition enhances the logo by:
1. Making it more relatable and human-centric
2. Visually representing the idea of a person sharing content from their own space
3. Adding a touch of personality to the design

The stick figure's simple design keeps the overall logo clean and easily recognizable even at smaller sizes.

Is this what you had in mind? Would you like any further modifications or adjustments to the stick figure or any other part of the logo?
