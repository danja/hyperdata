 The Victorian craft you're referring to is called "decoupage." 

Decoupage comes from the French word "d√©couper," which means "to cut out." This decorative technique involves cutting out pictures or designs from paper, gluing them onto various surfaces (such as boxes, furniture, or household items), and then coating the finished product with several layers of varnish or lacquer.

This craft became particularly popular during the Victorian era (1837-1901) as a genteel pastime for ladies. It was used to embellish a wide range of objects, from small trinket boxes to larger pieces of furniture, creating unique and personalized decorative items.

Would you like more information about the history or process of decoupage?
