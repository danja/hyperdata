 While I don't have direct access to the current state of Federated Wiki's plugin ecosystem, I can provide you with a list of plugins that are commonly associated with FedWiki based on my training data. Please note that this list may not be exhaustive or up-to-date, but it should give you a good starting point.

<antThinking>A list of FedWiki plugins is a good candidate for an artifact. It's substantial, self-contained, and likely to be referenced multiple times. I'll create a new artifact with the identifier "fedwiki-plugins-list".</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="fedwiki-plugins-list" type="text/markdown" title="Common Federated Wiki (FedWiki) Plugins">

# Common Federated Wiki (FedWiki) Plugins

This list covers a wide range of functionalities that extend FedWiki's capabilities. When considering creating a new plugin for SPARQL integration, you might want to pay special attention to plugins that deal with data storage, retrieval, and querying, such as:

1. **search**: Understanding how it queries across pages could be insightful.
2. **grep**: This might provide ideas on how to implement cross-page searching.
3. **transport**: Could offer insights into data import/export mechanisms.
4. **reference**: Might be useful for understanding how to link external data.
5. **report**: Could provide ideas on how to generate content based on queried data.

For your SPARQL store plugin, you'd likely need to implement functionalities similar to these, but interfacing with a SPARQL endpoint instead of FedWiki's default storage.

Would you like more information on how any of these plugins might relate to your SPARQL store plugin idea?
