 Certainly! I'll modify the logo to make the doorway the same color as the stick figure (black). This will create an interesting visual effect where the figure appears to be emerging from or blending with the doorway.

<antThinking>I'll update the existing logo design, changing only the color of the doorway from white to black, matching the stick figure. This subtle change could create an intriguing visual effect and potentially add depth to the logo's symbolism.</antThinking>

Here's the updated logo with the changes you requested:

1. House Color: Crimson (#DC143C)
2. Wi-Fi Signals: Pale Blue (#4A90E2)
3. Stick Figure: Black (#000000)
4. Doorway: Black (#000000), matching the stick figure

This new combination creates an interesting visual effect:

- The crimson house still provides a bold and energetic backdrop.
- The pale blue Wi-Fi signals stand out against the crimson, emphasizing the "broadcasting" aspect.
- The black doorway and stick figure create a strong contrast against the crimson house.
- The figure now appears to be emerging from or part of the doorway, which could symbolize the connection between the individual and their personal digital space.

This design offers several interpretations:

1. It could represent the user being an integral part of their own digital home.
2. It might symbolize the seamless integration of the individual with their self-hosted content.
3. The figure emerging from the black space could represent bringing one's thoughts and content out into the world.

The overall effect is striking and thought-provoking, maintaining the bold color scheme while adding an extra layer of visual interest and potential symbolism.

What do you think of this version? Does it capture the essence of your "homepage first" concept? Would you like to see any further adjustments or explore any other ideas based on this design?
