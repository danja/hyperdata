 You're welcome! I'm glad I could help you identify that you have the T-Watch-2020 V1. 

Since you've confirmed it's the V1 model, here are a few key points to keep in mind:

1. It has a single button on the right side.
2. It uses the ESP32-PICO-D4 chip.
3. It has the AXP202 power management chip.
4. It uses the BMA423 accelerometer.

This information can be helpful if you're looking for specific tutorials, planning to program the device, or if you need to troubleshoot any issues in the future.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about your T-Watch-2020 V1?
