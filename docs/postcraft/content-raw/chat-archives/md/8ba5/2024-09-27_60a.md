 Your idea for encouraging people to prioritize self-hosted content is interesting and aligns with principles of digital autonomy. Let's explore some potential names, slogans, and branding ideas for this concept.

<antThinking>Creating a set of branding suggestions including a name, slogan, and simple logo concept would be a good fit for an artifact. It's substantial, self-contained content that the user might want to modify or iterate on. I'll create a new artifact for this.</antThinking>

# Self-Hosted Content Campaign Branding Ideas

## Campaign Names:
1. "Own Your Words"
2. "Digital Roots"
3. "Content Homestead"
4. "YourSpace First"
5. "Self-Published Web"

## Slogans:
1. "Plant your thoughts, grow your presence"
2. "Your content, your rules"
3. "Be the source, not just the share"
4. "Cultivate your digital garden"
5. "Write for yourself, share with the world"

## Logo Concept:
A simple, memorable logo could be a house icon with a Wi-Fi signal emanating from it, symbolizing self-hosted content broadcast to the world. Here's a basic SVG representation:

<antArtifact identifier="self-hosted-content-logo" type="image/svg+xml" title="Self-Hosted Content Campaign Logo">
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
  <path d="M50 10 L90 50 L80 50 L80 90 L20 90 L20 50 L10 50 Z" fill="#4A90E2"/>
  <path d="M40 50 A10 10 0 0 1 60 50 A20 20 0 0 0 30 50 A30 30 0 0 1 70 50" fill="none" stroke="#FFF" stroke-width="5"/>
</svg>
</antArtifact>

## Badge Idea:
A small badge that bloggers and website owners could add to their sites:

"üè†‚û°Ô∏èüåê Content Homesteader"

This badge visually represents the idea of content starting at home (the house emoji) and then going out to the wider web (the globe emoji).

These branding ideas aim to capture the essence of your campaign while being memorable and visually appealing. The name "Digital Roots" or "Content Homestead" could work well, as they evoke the idea of having a primary, self-controlled base for one's online presence.

The slogan "Plant your thoughts, grow your presence" aligns with this theme, suggesting that by starting with self-hosted content, people can cultivate a more meaningful online presence.

The logo concept represents the idea of broadcasting from a personal space (the house) to the wider internet.

Would you like me to expand on any of these ideas or explore a different direction for the campaign branding?
