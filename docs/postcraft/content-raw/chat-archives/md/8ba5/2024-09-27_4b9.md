 When working on refrigeration systems, dealing with pressure is a crucial safety concern. Professional technicians follow specific procedures and use specialized tools to handle the pressurized refrigerant safely. Here's how they typically approach this:

1. Recovery Equipment:
   - Technicians use a refrigerant recovery machine to safely remove and store the refrigerant from the system before opening it.
   - This reduces the pressure in the system to safe levels.

2. Pressure Gauges:
   - Manifold gauge sets are used to monitor the pressure in different parts of the system.
   - These help technicians understand the state of the system and ensure safe pressure levels.

3. Safety Valves:
   - Many refrigeration systems have built-in safety valves that release pressure if it becomes dangerously high.

4. Proper Training:
   - Technicians undergo specific training on how to handle pressurized systems safely.
   - This includes understanding the properties of different refrigerants and their associated pressures.

5. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):
   - Safety glasses, gloves, and sometimes face shields are used to protect against potential refrigerant leaks.

6. Controlled Release:
   - If needed, technicians may slowly release pressure using service valves, allowing for a controlled depressurization.

7. Vacuum Pumps:
   - After repairs, a vacuum pump is used to remove air and moisture from the system before recharging.

8. Leak Detection:
   - Electronic leak detectors or soap solutions are used to check for leaks before pressurizing the system.

9. Proper Tools:
   - Specialized tools like flaring tools, tube cutters, and brazing equipment are used to ensure proper sealing when working on pressurized components.

10. Legal Considerations:
    - In many jurisdictions, handling refrigerants requires certification (e.g., EPA certification in the US).
    - This ensures that only qualified individuals work on these systems.

11. System Knowledge:
    - Understanding the specific refrigeration cycle and components helps in anticipating pressure issues.

12. Gradual Repressurization:
    - After repairs, systems are gradually recharged and pressurized to avoid sudden stress on components.

13. Documentation:
    - Technicians often document pressures and temperatures at various points in the system for future reference.

It's important to note that working on pressurized refrigeration systems can be dangerous if not done properly. Refrigerants can cause frostbite if they contact skin, and some can displace oxygen in enclosed spaces. Additionally, improper handling can lead to environmental damage, as many refrigerants are potent greenhouse gases.

For these reasons, it's generally recommended that only certified professionals work on refrigeration systems. DIY repairs on such systems are not advisable due to the safety risks and the potential for environmental harm.
