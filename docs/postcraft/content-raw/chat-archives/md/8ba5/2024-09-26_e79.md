 The TTGO_TWatch_Library's approach to utilizing the ESP32's dual-core processor is an important aspect of its design. Let me explain how it typically handles processor assignment:

1. Dual-Core Architecture:
   The ESP32 in the T-Watch-2020 V1 has two cores: Core 0 and Core 1.

2. Default Core Usage:
   - Core 0: By default, the Arduino environment and most user tasks run on Core 0.
   - Core 1: The TTGO_TWatch_Library often uses Core 1 for background tasks and certain hardware interactions.

3. Task Distribution:
   - The library doesn't explicitly assign all tasks to specific cores. Many functions run on whatever core calls them.
   - Some background tasks, particularly those related to power management or continuous sensor reading, may be assigned to Core 1.

4. Power Management:
   The AXP20X power management tasks often run on Core 1 to ensure consistent monitoring without interrupting the main application.

5. Display Updates:
   Display-related tasks usually run on the core that calls them, which is typically Core 0 if initiated from the main Arduino loop.

6. Sensor Monitoring:
   Continuous sensor monitoring (like the accelerometer) may be set up to run on Core 1.

7. User Control:
   The library generally doesn't prevent you from assigning tasks to specific cores. You can use ESP32's built-in functions like xTaskCreatePinnedToCore() to assign tasks to a particular core if needed.

8. Flexibility:
   The library is designed to be flexible, allowing developers to optimize core usage based on their specific application needs.

9. Configuration:
   Some aspects of task distribution can be adjusted in the library's configuration files, though this requires a deeper understanding of the library's internals.

It's worth noting that the exact core assignment can vary depending on the version of the library and the specific feature set being used. The library's design aims to balance performance and power efficiency, which is crucial for a wearable device like the T-Watch.

If you're developing a performance-critical application, you might want to use ESP32's native FreeRTOS functions to have more explicit control over task assignment to cores. However, for most applications, the default behavior of the TTGO_TWatch_Library should be sufficient.

Would you like to know more about how to optimize core usage in your T-Watch projects?
