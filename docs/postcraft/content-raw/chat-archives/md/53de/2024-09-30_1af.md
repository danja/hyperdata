 To determine the most reliable method for the receiver to detect the relative distance of each transmitter in this scenario, we need to consider the properties of the system and the available information. Given the setup you've described, the most reliable method would likely be based on Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) measurements. Here's a detailed explanation of how this could work:

1. Unique Pulse Sequences:
First, each transmitter should be assigned a unique pulse sequence. This could be achieved using different pulse patterns or codes for each transmitter, such as Gold codes or other orthogonal sequences. This allows the receiver to distinguish between the signals from different transmitters.

2. Time Synchronization:
Since the transmitters can time sync with each other, they should all start transmitting their unique sequences simultaneously. This provides a common time reference for all transmitters.

3. TDOA Measurements:
The receiver will detect the pulses from all four transmitters. Due to the different distances between each transmitter and the receiver, the pulses will arrive at slightly different times. The receiver can measure these time differences.

4. Cross-correlation:
To accurately determine the arrival time of each transmitter's signal, the receiver should use cross-correlation between the received signal and the known unique sequences for each transmitter. This will provide precise timing information for each transmitter's signal.

5. Hyperbolic Positioning:
Using the TDOA measurements, the receiver can calculate hyperbolic curves representing the possible locations of each transmitter relative to the others. The intersection of these hyperbolas will give the relative positions of the transmitters.

6. Distance Calculation:
Knowing the speed of sound in the medium (assuming these are acoustic transmitters), the relative distances can be calculated from the time differences.

This method is reliable because:

a) It doesn't rely on amplitude measurements, which can be affected by attenuation and interference.
b) Using unique sequences allows for clear identification of each transmitter's signal.
c) Time-based measurements can be very precise, especially with good synchronization.
d) It works well in multipath-free environments, as specified in your scenario.

To further improve reliability:

1. Use error-correcting codes in the pulse sequences to improve robustness against noise.
2. Implement a Kalman filter or other estimation techniques to smooth out measurements over time.
3. If possible, use multiple measurements and average the results to reduce the impact of any single erroneous measurement.

4. Periodically re-synchronize the transmitters to maintain accurate timing.

This approach should provide a reliable method for the receiver to detect the relative distances of the four transmitters in the given scenario.
