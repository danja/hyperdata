Imagine there are 4 acoustic transmitters that simultaneously send sequences of pulses, amplitude modulating a carrier wave. The same carrier frequency is used by all four. They are located in a space without reflections. They can be moved independently, but are able to time sync with each other. A single receiver is in the same space, receiving all four transmissions simultaneously. What would the most reliable method for the receiver to detecti the relative distance of each transmitter?
