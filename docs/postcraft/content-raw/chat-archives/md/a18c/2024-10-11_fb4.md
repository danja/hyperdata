 Certainly! Based on your interest in Pulsar's standard UI components, particularly the web page view, and the need to interact with a Node.js-based system, I'll modify the configuration to focus on these areas. I'll also include relevant configuration files.

Here's an updated `repopack.config.json`:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "filePath": "pulsar-ui-web.txt",
    "removeComments": false,
    "removeEmptyLines": false
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*.js",
    "src/**/*.ts",
    "packages/about/lib/**/*.js",
    "packages/settings-view/lib/**/*.js",
    "packages/notifications/lib/**/*.js",
    "packages/markdown-preview/lib/**/*.js",
    "static/**/*.less",
    "static/**/*.js",
    "static/**/*.html",
    "**/package.json",
    "*.json",
    "*.js"
  ],
  "ignore": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "useDefaultPatterns": true,
    "customPatterns": [
      "node_modules",
      "spec",
      "test",
      "**/*.md",
      "resources"
    ]
  }
}
```

This configuration:

1. Focuses on UI-related components:
   - Includes core `src` files
   - Adds specific UI-related packages like `about`, `settings-view`, `notifications`, and `markdown-preview` which often use web views
   - Includes static assets (LESS, JS, HTML) which are crucial for UI rendering

2. Includes configuration files:
   - Keeps all JSON files in the root directory
   - Includes JavaScript configuration files in the root

3. Retains comments and empty lines, which might be helpful for understanding the code structure

4. Still excludes `node_modules`, test files, and other non-essential directories

To use this configuration:

1. Save the above JSON as `repopack.config.json` in the Pulsar repository root.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   repopack -c repopack.config.json
   ```

This should give you a good overview of Pulsar's UI components, especially those related to web views, along with necessary configuration files. It will help you understand how Pulsar integrates web-based components and interacts with Node.js systems.

If the output is still too large, we can further refine by focusing on specific UI components or removing some of the included packages.

Q1: Would you like me to explain any specific parts of this configuration in more detail?
Q2: Are there any particular UI components or web view implementations you're most interested in?
Q3: Do you need any guidance on how to use the packed output to start customizing Pulsar's UI?
