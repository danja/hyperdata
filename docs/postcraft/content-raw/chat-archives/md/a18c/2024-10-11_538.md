 Based on the information provided in the repopack documentation and the blog post about Claude Projects, I can offer some advice on how to efficiently pack the Pulsar source code for our project:

1. Focus on core functionality: Since you're interested in customizing and extending Pulsar, we should prioritize the core components and extensibility mechanisms.

2. Exclude unnecessary files: We can skip test files, documentation, and most configuration files to save space.

3. Prioritize JavaScript/TypeScript files: These are likely to be the most relevant for development and customization.

4. Include key package files: The `package.json` files are important for understanding the project structure and dependencies.

5. Exclude third-party dependencies: The `node_modules` directory can be skipped as it contains external libraries.

Here's a suggested approach using repopack:

1. Create a `repopack.config.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
  "output": {
    "filePath": "pulsar-core.txt",
    "removeComments": true,
    "removeEmptyLines": true
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*.js",
    "src/**/*.ts",
    "packages/**/lib/**/*.js",
    "packages/**/lib/**/*.ts",
    "**/package.json"
  ],
  "ignore": {
    "useGitignore": true,
    "useDefaultPatterns": true,
    "customPatterns": [
      "node_modules",
      "spec",
      "test",
      "**/*.md",
      "**/*.txt",
      "static",
      "resources"
    ]
  }
}
```

2. Run repopack with this configuration:

```bash
repopack -c repopack.config.json
```

This configuration will:
- Focus on JavaScript and TypeScript files in the `src` and `packages` directories
- Include `package.json` files for understanding the project structure
- Exclude test files, documentation, and other non-essential directories
- Remove comments and empty lines to save space

This approach should give us a good balance of relevant code while staying within the 200K token limit. If the output is still too large, we can further refine the include patterns to focus on specific core packages or modules.

Q1: Would you like me to provide more specific include patterns for core Pulsar functionality?
Q2: Are there any particular areas of Pulsar you're most interested in customizing or extending?
Q3: Should we consider including any configuration files that might be crucial for understanding Pulsar's structure?
