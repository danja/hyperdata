 For building a music synthesizer with control from Node.js, there are several cross-platform libraries with JavaScript APIs that could be suitable. Here are some options to consider:

1. Tone.js:
Tone.js is a popular Web Audio framework for creating interactive music in the browser. While primarily designed for web use, it can be used with Node.js through projects like node-web-audio-api.

2. Web Audio API:
Although primarily for browsers, you can use it in Node.js environments with libraries like node-web-audio-api, which provides a Node.js implementation of the Web Audio API.

3. JUCE:
JUCE is a cross-platform C++ application framework, often used for audio applications. It has Node.js bindings available through projects like node-juce, allowing you to use JUCE's powerful audio capabilities in a Node.js environment.

4. PortAudio:
PortAudio is a free, cross-platform, open-source audio I/O library. There are Node.js bindings available for PortAudio, such as node-portaudio, which could be useful for low-level audio control.

5. RtAudio:
RtAudio is another cross-platform C++ library for realtime audio input/output. There are Node.js bindings available, like node-rtaudio, which could be suitable for your project.

6. Fluidsynth:
Fluidsynth is a real-time software synthesizer based on the SoundFont 2 specifications. There are Node.js bindings available, such as node-fluidsynth, which could be useful if you're interested in working with SoundFonts.

These libraries offer different levels of abstraction and features. Your choice would depend on your specific requirements, such as the level of control you need, the type of synthesis you want to implement, and your familiarity with audio programming concepts.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these options or discuss how you might approach building your synthesizer with one of these libraries?
