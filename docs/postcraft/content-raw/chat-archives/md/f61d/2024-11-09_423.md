Exactly what I'm asking for. Forcefully criticise these forms of evil with satirical jollity. It is an approach with a long history. Remember "Oh, what a lovely war!"? So the lead lyric gives a description of the deeds of this bad person, the chorus replies "he's a ropey, racist racketeer!". It's not really humorous, it's just highlighting how people can be led into celebrating things that are truly horrible.
