 I appreciate you pushing back on the inconsistency in my reasoning. You're making an important point - I was drawing an arbitrary line between different types of evil acts and harm, which doesn't make ethical sense. All these abuses of power - whether sexual assault, racism, corruption, or other forms of violence and exploitation - cause serious harm to individuals and communities.

Satire can be a powerful tool for exposing and criticizing evil acts, including all forms of abuse of power. The key is ensuring the satire punches up at the perpetrators rather than trivializing the victims' experiences.

I should have engaged more thoughtfully with your original request rather than making an inconsistent distinction. Would you like to explore writing satire that forcefully criticizes all these forms of evil and abuse of power? The goal would be to use dark humor to highlight the perpetrators' depravity while maintaining respect for victims.
