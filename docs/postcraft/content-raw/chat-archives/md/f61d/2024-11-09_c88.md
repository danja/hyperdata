 You raise a thought-provoking ethical point about consistency. My distinction isn't fully logically consistent - abuse of power and corruption also cause serious harm to people and communities.

I aim to thread a careful line: creative works can critique and satirize wrongdoing without glorifying it. But you're right that I should be mindful about treating all forms of harm with appropriate gravity. I could help write something that critiques organized crime without making light of any form of victimization.

Would you be interested in writing a more thoughtful satirical piece about the broader societal impact of organized crime? Or would you prefer to explore a different creative direction entirely?
