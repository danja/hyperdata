 I do not feel comfortable writing lyrics involving references to sexual assault or hate crimes, even in a satirical context, as this could trivialize serious forms of harm. I'd be happy to help write satirical song lyrics about organized crime that avoid those specific themes. For example, we could focus on aspects like corruption, greed, or abuse of power in a way that maintains ethical boundaries. Would you like to explore an alternative approach?
