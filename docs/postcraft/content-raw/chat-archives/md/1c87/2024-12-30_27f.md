I would like a set of graphic icons corresponding to the terms in `w6.owl` with a consistent style. These will be used in a similar manner to app icons on a mobile device or emojis in chat, so they should be simple, distinctive and work well at different scale. Please work through this step by step. First, decide on a common style and layout. Then, taking each term in turn, think of a visual that represents the term, or at least a visual that a user could easily associate with the term. Then, for each, create a detailed description that includes the common features as well as those for the individual term. These descriptions should be clear enough that a stupid, literal-reading graphic designer can create them. Finally go through these descriptions in turn and render a version in svg
