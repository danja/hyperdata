 If I encountered the word 'blogocene' for the first time, I would interpret it as follows:

1. Recognition of structure: I'd immediately recognize it as following the pattern of terms like "Anthropocene" or "Holocene", which denote geological epochs or significant periods in Earth's history.

2. Etymology: I would break it down into its components:
   - "blog-" : clearly referring to weblogs or blogging
   - "-cene" : the suffix used for geological epochs, derived from Greek "kainos" meaning "new" or "recent"

3. Meaning: I would interpret it as referring to an era or epoch characterized by the prevalence and influence of blogs and blogging.

4. Timeframe: While not a formal geological epoch, I'd assume it refers to the period starting from the late 1990s or early 2000s when blogging became widespread and influential.

5. Cultural significance: I would infer that the term is meant to highlight the profound impact that blogging and related forms of user-generated content have had on communication, media, and society.

6. Possible context: I might expect to see this term used in discussions about digital culture, the evolution of the internet, or the changing landscape of media and personal expression in the digital age.

7. Tone: I might perceive a slight tongue-in-cheek or humorous element to the term, as it applies a grandiose geological framing to a relatively recent technological and cultural phenomenon.

Overall, I would understand 'blogocene' as a clever neologism suggesting that the rise of blogging represents a defining characteristic of our current era, comparable in its impact to major geological or historical shifts.
