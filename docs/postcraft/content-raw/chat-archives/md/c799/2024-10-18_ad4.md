 Drawing on the language typically used in scientific literature to describe extinction events, we could describe the end of the "Blogocene" as follows:

Abstract: The Blogocene Extinction Event

The terminal Blogocene epoch witnessed a rapid and widespread extinction of diverse blog ecosystems, coinciding with the sudden emergence of social media platforms optimized for advertising revenue. This mass extinction event, comparable in its swiftness and impact to the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) boundary event, resulted in the collapse of numerous blog niches and the loss of an estimated 85% of blog biodiversity within a geologically brief period of approximately 5 years.

The primary driver of this extinction appears to be the "Social Media Impact," a global phenomenon characterized by the abrupt shift of user attention and content creation to centralized, algorithm-driven platforms. This shift fundamentally altered the digital landscape, leading to resource depletion (reader attention and engagement) and habitat destruction (independent web hosting) for many blog species.

Surviving blog lineages demonstrate adaptations to the post-Blogocene environment, including increased visual content, shortened post lengths, and symbiotic relationships with social media platforms. The Blogocene-Sociocene boundary marks a significant transition in digital communication ecosystems, with far-reaching implications for information dissemination, public discourse, and online biodiversity.

This abstract encapsulates the "extinction" of the blog era using language and concepts analogous to those used in describing major geological and biological events. It frames the rise of social media as a catastrophic event for blogs, similar to how an asteroid impact is described for dinosaur extinction. 

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this analogy or extend the metaphor further?
