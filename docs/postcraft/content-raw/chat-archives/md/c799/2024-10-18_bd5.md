 To construct a term for 'the blog era' in the style of 'Anthropocene', we would use Greek roots to create a new word. Let's break this down:

1. The suffix '-cene' comes from the Greek 'kainos', meaning 'new' or 'recent'. This is used in geological epoch names.

2. We need a prefix that relates to blogs or blogging.

3. 'Blog' is short for 'weblog', which doesn't have a direct Greek equivalent since it's a modern term.

4. We could use 'logos' (λόγος), meaning 'word' or 'speech', which is somewhat related to the concept of blogging as a form of online discourse.

5. Alternatively, we could use 'grapho' (γράφω), meaning 'to write'.

Combining these elements, we could create:

1. "Logocene" (from 'logos' + 'kainos')
2. "Graphocene" (from 'grapho' + 'kainos')

Of these, "Logocene" might be the better choice as it more broadly encompasses the idea of online discourse that blogging represents.

Would you like me to elaborate on this construction or explore other possible terms?
