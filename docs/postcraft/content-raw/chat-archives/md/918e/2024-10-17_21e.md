 Based on the project knowledge available, here's a conceptual description for a promotional poster for the hyperdata-desktop project:

A futuristic, sleek desktop computer monitor takes center stage, its screen illuminated with a vibrant, interconnected web of data points and icons. The screen's content seems to leap out in a holographic display, with 3D representations of folders, files, and applications floating in the space around the monitor.

In the foreground, a pair of hands appear to be manipulating the holographic elements, suggesting intuitive gesture control. The hands are surrounded by a faint glow, emphasizing the seamless interaction between user and interface.

The background transitions from a typical office setting on one side to a cosmic, star-filled expanse on the other, symbolizing the bridge between everyday computing and vast data universes.

Orbiting around the central monitor are smaller screens or devices, each displaying different aspects of the Hyperdata ecosystem: a calendar, a chat interface, a code editor, and a graph database visualization.

At the top of the poster, the "Hyperdata Desktop" logo shimmers with a metallic, high-tech finish. Below it, a tagline reads: "Your Gateway to Infinite Data Dimensions."

The overall color scheme should be predominantly cool blues and purples, with accents of bright cyan and white to highlight key elements, creating a sense of depth and technological advancement.

Q1: How should we incorporate the project's focus on data visualization in the poster design?
Q2: What specific Hyperdata Desktop features should be prominently displayed in the holographic interface?
Q3: How can we visually represent the project's emphasis on customization and extensibility in the poster?
