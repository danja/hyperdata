 Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCOâ‚ƒ) is an effective cleaning agent due to its chemical properties:

1. Mild abrasive: Its fine, crystalline structure provides gentle scrubbing action without scratching most surfaces.

2. Alkaline nature: With a pH of about 8.3, it's slightly basic, which helps it react with acidic substances in grease and food residues.

3. Neutralization reactions: It can neutralize odors and stains caused by acidic substances.

4. Saponification: When mixed with oils or fats, it can create a soap-like substance that helps in cleaning.

5. Gas formation: When combined with acids (like vinegar), it produces carbon dioxide gas, which can help lift dirt and grime.

6. Solvent action: It can help dissolve certain types of deposits and stains.

7. Emulsifying properties: It can help break down and suspend grease particles in water.

8. Non-toxic nature: It's safe for use around food preparation areas.

For tough grease, its effectiveness can be enhanced by:

- Combining with vinegar to create a stronger reaction
- Using hot water to increase reactivity and solubility
- Leaving it as a paste on the surface for extended periods

While not as potent as caustic soda, baking soda offers a much safer alternative for household cleaning, especially for cookware.
