 When making a solution of caustic soda (sodium hydroxide), it is crucial to always add the caustic soda to water, not the other way around. This principle is often remembered as "Do what you oughta, add acid to water" - the same rule applies to strong bases like caustic soda.

Here's why this order is important:

1. Exothermic reaction: Dissolving caustic soda in water produces a significant amount of heat. 

2. Safety: Adding water to caustic soda can cause a violent reaction, potentially leading to dangerous splashing of the corrosive solution.

3. Heat dissipation: When you add the caustic soda to water, the large volume of water can absorb and dissipate the heat more effectively.

4. Control: Adding the solid to water allows for better control of the reaction rate.

5. Avoiding steam explosions: If water is added to a large amount of caustic soda, it might flash into steam due to the intense heat, causing an explosive reaction.

The proper procedure is:

1. Start with a container of cold water.
2. Slowly add small amounts of the caustic soda to the water while stirring constantly.
3. Never add water to the caustic soda.

It's important to note that working with caustic soda requires proper safety equipment, including eye protection, gloves, and appropriate clothing. It's extremely corrosive and can cause severe burns. If you're not trained in handling such chemicals, it's best to avoid using them altogether.
