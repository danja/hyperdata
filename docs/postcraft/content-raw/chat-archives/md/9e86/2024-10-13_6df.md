 There are several household items you can use to remove burnt-on grease from a chip pan:

1. Baking soda and vinegar: Make a paste with baking soda and water, apply it to the pan, and let it sit. Then scrub with a non-abrasive sponge. You can also add vinegar for extra cleaning power.

2. Dish soap and hot water: Soak the pan in hot water with dish soap for several hours or overnight, then scrub.

3. Salt and lime juice: Sprinkle salt on the greasy areas, squeeze lime juice over it, and let it sit before scrubbing.

4. Dryer sheets: Place a dryer sheet in the pan with warm water and let it soak overnight. The softening agents can help loosen the grease.

5. Boiling water and salt: Boil water in the pan, add salt, and let it sit. The salt can help break down the grease.

Regarding caustic soda (sodium hydroxide):

While caustic soda can be effective at removing grease, it's not recommended for use on stainless steel. Caustic soda is highly corrosive and can damage the surface of stainless steel, potentially causing pitting or other forms of corrosion. It's best to avoid using caustic soda on any cookware, especially stainless steel.

Instead, stick to gentler, food-safe cleaning methods like those mentioned above. If these don't work, you might consider commercial degreasers specifically designed for cookware, but always check that they're safe for use on stainless steel.
