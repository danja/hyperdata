 It's unlikely that you'll be able to connect your computer directly to an LG subwoofer without the accompanying soundbar. Here's why:

1. LG subwoofers are typically designed to work as part of a complete sound system, usually paired with a specific soundbar model.

2. These subwoofers often don't have standalone Bluetooth connectivity. Instead, they usually connect wirelessly to the soundbar, which then connects to your audio source (like your computer).

3. LG does use a proprietary wireless protocol for connecting their soundbars to subwoofers. This protocol is not the same as standard Bluetooth and is not designed to connect directly to computers or other devices.

4. The absence of the subwoofer in your Bluetooth device list confirms that it likely doesn't have its own Bluetooth capability.

To use the subwoofer with your computer, you would typically need:

1. The paired LG soundbar
2. To connect your computer to the soundbar (via Bluetooth, optical cable, or HDMI, depending on the model)

Without the soundbar, it's highly unlikely you'll be able to use the subwoofer with your computer. If you're looking for a standalone subwoofer solution for your computer, you might want to consider purchasing a computer-specific subwoofer or a different audio system altogether.

If you'd like to provide more details about your specific subwoofer model, I could try to give you more precise information. Also, if you're interested in alternative audio setups for your computer, I'd be happy to suggest some options.
