 Based on my review of the paper, there are a few recent developments related to hybrid photovoltaic thermal (PVT) solar collectors that are discussed:

- Use of nanofluids as the heat transfer fluid: The paper mentions that recent studies have explored using nanofluids as the heat transfer fluid in PVT collectors instead of water. The suspended nanoparticles can enhance the thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficient of the fluid. This can potentially improve the overall efficiency of the PVT collector.

- Spectrally selective coatings on the absorber plate: Some recent studies have worked on using spectrally selective coatings on the absorber plate of PVT collectors. These coatings have higher absorptivity in the visible range for PV operation and higher reflectivity in the infrared range to reduce thermal emission losses. This can help improve the electrical and thermal efficiency of the PVT collector.

- Hybrid PVT designs with concentrators: Concentrators like compound parabolic concentrators are being used along with PVT collectors. The concentrators focus more solar radiation onto the PV cells to boost electricity generation, while the thermal energy is captured from the heated absorber plate. This hybrid design can improve the overall utilization of the solar spectrum.

- Heat pipe based PVT collectors: Heat pipes integrated with the PVT absorber plate can help improve heat removal and thermal efficiency. The evaporator section of the heat pipe is bonded to the absorber plate while the condensed heat is transferred to the heat transfer fluid. This allows better thermal management.

- Use of glazed and unglazed PVT collectors: Glazed PVT collectors with a glass cover reduce convection losses but increase cost. Unglazed PVT collectors without a cover are cheaper but lose more heat to the ambient. Tradeoffs between glazed and unglazed PVTs are being explored.

In summary, recent PVT developments have focused on advanced materials, optical enhancements, heat transfer improvements and design optimizations to improve the overall conversion efficiency and performance.
