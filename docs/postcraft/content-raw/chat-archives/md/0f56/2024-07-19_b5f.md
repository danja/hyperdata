 I apologize for the persistent issue. This error suggests that there might be a deeper incompatibility or a caching problem. Let's try a more thorough approach:

1. First, let's completely uninstall NumPy and then reinstall it:

   ```python
   !pip uninstall numpy -y
   !pip install numpy==1.23.5
   ```

2. If that doesn't work, we need to check which package is trying to import `fastCopyAndTranspose`. Add this code at the beginning of your script:

   ```python
   import traceback
   import sys

   original_import = __import__

   def import_tracker(name, *args, **kwargs):
       if name == 'numpy.core._multiarray_umath':
           print(f"Importing {name}")
           traceback.print_stack()
       return original_import(name, *args, **kwargs)

   sys.__import__ = import_tracker
   ```

   This will help us identify which package is causing the import.

3. Run your code again and see which package is triggering the NumPy import.

4. Once we identify the problematic package, we may need to adjust its version as well. It's likely a package that depends on an older version of NumPy.

5. If the issue persists, let's try to force a reinstall of all packages:

   ```python
   !pip freeze > requirements.txt
   !pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will uninstall all packages and then reinstall them, which can sometimes resolve conflicts.

6. If you're using Colab, try creating a new notebook and installing only the essential packages you need for your specific task.

7. As a last resort, you might need to use an older version of the package that's causing the issue (the one we identified in step 3).

If none of these steps work, please provide the following information:

1. The full error traceback you're getting.
2. The list of packages you're using (you can get this by running `!pip freeze`).
3. Any specific operations or libraries you're using when this error occurs.

With this information, we can better diagnose the root cause and provide a more tailored solution. Would you like to try these steps, or do you have any questions about this approach?
