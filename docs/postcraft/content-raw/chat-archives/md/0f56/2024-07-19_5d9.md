 To load a video file into a Google Colab notebook, you have a few options. Here's a step-by-step guide to upload a video file and set it to the path you specified:

1. Upload from your local machine:

   At the left sidebar of your Colab notebook, click on the folder icon to open the file browser.
   Click on the upload icon (looks like a file with an up arrow).
   Select your video file from your local machine.
   After uploading, you'll need to move it to the correct directory.

2. Move the file to the correct directory:

   First, ensure the directory exists:

   ```python
   !mkdir -p data/input
   ```

   Then, move the file:

   ```python
   !mv snippet.mp4 data/input/
   ```

3. Verify the file is in place:

   ```python
   !ls data/input
   ```

4. Set the video_path:

   ```python
   video_path = 'data/input/snippet.mp4'
   ```

Alternatively, if your video is available online, you can download it directly:

```python
!mkdir -p data/input
!wget -O data/input/snippet.mp4 "YOUR_VIDEO_URL_HERE"
video_path = 'data/input/snippet.mp4'
```

Replace "YOUR_VIDEO_URL_HERE" with the actual URL of your video.

If you're working with a large video file, you might consider using Google Drive:

1. Upload the video to your Google Drive.
2. Mount your Google Drive in Colab:

   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```

3. Copy the file from Drive to your Colab environment:

   ```python
   !cp "/content/drive/My Drive/path/to/your/video/snippet.mp4" "data/input/"
   video_path = 'data/input/snippet.mp4'
   ```

Remember to replace "/path/to/your/video/" with the actual path in your Google Drive.

Would you like me to explain any of these methods in more detail?
