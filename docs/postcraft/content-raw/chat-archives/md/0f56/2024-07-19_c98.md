 I apologize for overlooking the simpler option. You're absolutely correct, there is indeed a menu item for clearing output in Google Colab. Here's how to use it:

1. In the top menu bar of your Colab notebook, click on "Runtime".
2. In the dropdown menu, you'll see an option that says "Restart and run all".
3. Next to this option, you'll see a small arrow. Click on this arrow to reveal more options.
4. In this submenu, you'll find "Restart and clear all outputs".

Selecting "Restart and clear all outputs" will clear the output of all cells and restart the runtime. This is equivalent to clearing all stdout and also resets the state of your notebook.

If you want to clear outputs without restarting:

1. Go to the "Edit" menu in the top menu bar.
2. Look for "Clear all outputs" in the dropdown.

This option will clear all outputs without restarting the runtime, preserving your current variable states and imports.

Thank you for pointing this out. It's often these straightforward UI options that can be the most convenient for users. Would you like any more information about managing outputs in Colab?
