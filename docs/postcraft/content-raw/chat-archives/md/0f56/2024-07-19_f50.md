# [Formatted File Path with Python F-strings](https://claude.ai/chat/0f56fce6-f746-4c1c-94a6-ba5a9279d121)

 To include a directory but exclude all its contents in a .gitignore file, you can use the following syntax:

```
# Include the directory
!data/input/

# Exclude everything inside the directory
data/input/*
```

Here's how this works:

1. The `!` at the beginning of a line in .gitignore means "don't ignore this". So `!data/input/` tells Git to track the `data/input/` directory.

2. `data/input/*` tells Git to ignore everything inside the `data/input/` directory.

The order is important here. By putting the exclusion rule after the inclusion rule, you're telling Git: "Track the directory itself, but don't track anything inside it."

This approach will:
- Keep the `data/input/` directory in version control
- Ignore all files and subdirectories directly inside `data/input/`
- Allow you to commit an empty `data/input/` directory to your repository

Note that if you want to track the directory but it's completely empty, you might need to add an empty .gitkeep file inside it, as Git doesn't track empty directories by default.

Would you like me to explain any part of this further?
