 To run all cells in a Google Colab notebook at once, you have a few options:

1. Using the menu:
   - Go to the "Runtime" menu at the top of the notebook.
   - Select "Run all" from the dropdown menu.

2. Using a keyboard shortcut:
   - On Windows/Linux: Ctrl + F9
   - On Mac: Cmd + F9

3. Using the toolbar:
   - Look for the "play" button icon in the toolbar (it looks like a right-pointing triangle).
   - Click on the small arrow next to it to reveal a dropdown menu.
   - Select "Run all" from this menu.

4. To run all cells and also restart the runtime:
   - Go to the "Runtime" menu.
   - Select "Restart and run all".
   - Confirm when prompted.

Important notes:
- Running all cells will execute them in order from top to bottom.
- If there are any errors in a cell, execution will stop at that cell.
- Make sure you want to run all cells, especially if your notebook contains cells that modify data or take a long time to execute.
- If you have made changes to earlier cells, running all cells ensures that your entire notebook is in a consistent state.

Would you like me to explain any of these methods further or provide any additional information about running cells in Colab?
