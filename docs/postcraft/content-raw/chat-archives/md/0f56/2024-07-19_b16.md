 To split a code block in Google Colab, you can use the following methods:

1. Using the UI:
   - Hover your mouse over the left side of the code cell you want to split.
   - Look for a small "+" icon that appears.
   - Click on this "+" icon where you want to split the cell.

2. Using keyboard shortcuts:
   - Place your cursor where you want to split the cell.
   - Press Ctrl + M + - (Control + M, then minus sign) on Windows/Linux.
   - On Mac, use Cmd + M + - (Command + M, then minus sign).

3. Using code:
   You can also programmatically add a new cell below the current one and move code into it:
   
   ```python
   from google.colab import output
   output.eval_js('notebook.insert_cell_below()')
   ```

   This will insert a new cell below the current one, but you'll need to manually move the code you want to split into the new cell.

4. Split large code blocks:
   If you have a large block of code and want to split it into multiple cells automatically, you can use this function:

   ```python
   from google.colab import output

   def split_cell(cell_contents, split_char='\n\n'):
       cells = cell_contents.split(split_char)
       for cell in cells:
           if cell.strip():  # Ignore empty cells
               output.eval_js(f'notebook.insert_cell_below().set_text({repr(cell)})')

   # Usage example:
   code_block = """
   print("This is cell 1")

   print("This is cell 2")

   print("This is cell 3")
   """

   split_cell(code_block)
   ```

   This function will split a large code block at double newlines and create new cells for each part.

Remember that after splitting cells, you may need to re-run the cells to see their output.

Would you like me to clarify any of these methods?
