 Backlinks are a powerful feature in Obsidian that automatically create bidirectional connections between notes. Here's how they work:

1. Creation:
   - When you link to a note from another note, Obsidian automatically creates a backlink.
   - For example, if you link to "Note B" from "Note A", a backlink to "Note A" is created in "Note B".

2. Visibility:
   - Backlinks are displayed in a dedicated pane, usually at the bottom or side of the note.
   - This pane shows all other notes that link to the current note.

3. Context:
   - Backlinks often show a snippet of the context in which the link appears.
   - This helps you understand how the current note relates to others without opening them.

4. Unlinked mentions:
   - Obsidian also shows "unlinked mentions" - instances where the title of the current note appears in other notes without being explicitly linked.
   - You can easily convert these to actual links if desired.

5. Navigation:
   - Clicking on a backlink takes you directly to the referencing note.
   - This allows for quick navigation between related ideas.

6. Knowledge discovery:
   - Backlinks help you discover connections between ideas you might not have consciously made.
   - They can reveal patterns and relationships in your knowledge base.

7. Network view:
   - Backlinks contribute to Obsidian's graph view, showing the interconnectedness of your notes visually.

8. Automatic updates:
   - If you change a note's title, Obsidian automatically updates all backlinks to reflect the new title.

9. Contextual relevance:
   - The number and nature of backlinks can indicate how central or important a note is in your knowledge system.

Backlinks are a core feature of Obsidian's approach to networked thought, enabling a web-like structure of information rather than a rigid hierarchy. They support non-linear thinking and can help uncover unexpected connections between ideas.

Would you like me to explain how to effectively use backlinks in your note-taking workflow?
