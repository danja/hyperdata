 I understand your concern. You're right that Google uses a complex authentication system for accessing and downloading Gmail archives, which isn't easily replicated with simple tools like wget. Let's explore some options that can handle this complexity:

1. Use Google's official tool: Google Takeout

Google Takeout is designed to handle all the authentication and session management internally. Here's how you can use it:

1. Go to Google Takeout (https://takeout.google.com/)
2. Select only Gmail data
3. Choose to export to Google Drive instead of downloading directly
4. Use Google Drive's desktop client to download the archive

This method offloads the complex authentication to Google's own tools, which are designed to handle intermittent connections.

2. Use a browser extension for download management

Browser extensions can integrate with your existing session and handle the authentication seamlessly. Some options:

- DownThemAll! (Firefox, Chrome)
- Chrono Download Manager (Chrome)

These extensions can often resume downloads and handle complex authentication without you needing to manage cookies or headers manually.

3. Use a dedicated download manager with browser integration

Some download managers can integrate with your browser to capture downloads, including all necessary cookies and authentication data. Examples include:

- Internet Download Manager (Windows)
- JDownloader (cross-platform)

These tools often have browser extensions that allow them to "catch" downloads and handle them with their more robust downloading capabilities.

4. Use a programming approach with authenticated sessions

If you're comfortable with programming, you could use a language like Python with libraries that can handle browser-like sessions. Here's a basic outline:

```python
import requests
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from requests.packages.urllib3.util.retry import Retry

def download_file(url, filename):
    session = requests.Session()
    retry = Retry(total=5, backoff_factor=0.1)
    adapter = HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retry)
    session.mount('http://', adapter)
    session.mount('https://', adapter)
    
    # You'd need to set up authentication here, possibly using saved cookies
    # session.cookies.update({'your_auth_cookie': 'value'})

    response = session.get(url, stream=True)
    with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
        for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=8192): 
            if chunk:
                f.write(chunk)

# Usage
download_file('your_gmail_archive_url', 'gmail_archive.zip')
```

This script uses the `requests` library to create a session (maintaining cookies and authentication) and implements retry logic for handling connection issues.

5. Use a headless browser automation tool

Tools like Selenium or Puppeteer can automate a full browser, handling all the authentication and session management just like you would manually. This is more complex to set up but can replicate your manual process exactly.

Given the complexity of Google's authentication system, I'd recommend starting with the Google Takeout to Google Drive method, as it's the most straightforward and uses Google's own tools to handle the authentication and transfer. If that doesn't work for your situation, the browser extension or dedicated download manager would be the next best options.

Would you like more details on implementing any of these approaches?
