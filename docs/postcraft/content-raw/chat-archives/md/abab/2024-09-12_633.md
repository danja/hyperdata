 Given your unreliable internet connection and the complexities involved in downloading Gmail archives, a simple wget command won't suffice. Here's a more robust approach you can consider:

1. Use a download manager: 
Download managers are designed to handle interrupted downloads and complex URLs. They often support resuming downloads and can manage authentication.

Some options to consider:

- uGet (Linux, Windows, macOS)
- JDownloader (cross-platform)
- Free Download Manager (cross-platform)

These tools can often handle the authentication and resumption issues better than a browser.

2. Use Google Takeout with Drive:
Instead of directly downloading your Gmail archive, you can use Google Takeout to export your data to Google Drive. Then, you can use Google Drive's desktop client to sync the files. This method has several advantages:

- The initial export happens on Google's servers, so your connection doesn't matter for that part.
- Google Drive's sync client is designed to handle interruptions and resume uploads/downloads.
- You can sync specific folders, allowing for more granular control.

3. Use a script with the Gmail API:
If you're comfortable with programming, you could write a script using the Gmail API to download your emails in batches. This would allow you to implement your own resumption logic and error handling.

4. Use a cloud-based downloader:
Some services allow you to input a download link, and they'll download the file to their servers. Once complete, you can download from their servers, which might be more reliable. Be cautious with this method, as it involves sharing your Google account information with a third party.

5. Consider a VPN:
If your connection issues are related to network instability rather than physical disconnections, a VPN might help maintain a more stable connection.

Before proceeding, ensure you have sufficient storage space for your Gmail archive, as these can be quite large.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these methods? Or do you have a preference for which approach you'd like to try?
