I need to download my email archives from gmail but I have a very unreliable internet connection. For downloading from simple URLs I would use wget -c and resume if the line dropped. When I try downloading the gmail archive from a browser is does have a kind of resume, but doesn't appear to restart where it left off a lot of the time. It also has quite a complicated URL and it looks like there is some kind of auth involved too. How can I do a reliable, resumable, efficient download?
