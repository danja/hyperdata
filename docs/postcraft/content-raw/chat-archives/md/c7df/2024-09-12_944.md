 Ah, "fetishism" - that's indeed a more specific term than the ones I suggested. Good that you remembered it. 

Fetishism refers to a form of sexual desire in which gratification is linked to an abnormal degree to a particular object, body part, or activity. It's often used in a broader sense to describe an excessive or irrational commitment to something.

Is there anything else you'd like to know about this concept or related terminology?
