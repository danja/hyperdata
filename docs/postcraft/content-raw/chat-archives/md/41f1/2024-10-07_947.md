 In theory, it is possible to modify certain aspects of a GGUF (GPT Generated Unified Format) model's runtime behavior while keeping the original parameters intact. This could potentially include changing activation functions in feed-forward networks. However, there are several important considerations:

1. Complexity: GGUF is a relatively new format, and modifying its runtime behavior is not a trivial task. It would require deep understanding of both the GGUF format and the underlying neural network architecture.

2. Compatibility: Changing core components like activation functions could potentially lead to incompatibilities with the rest of the model architecture, as the original parameters were trained with specific activation functions in mind.

3. Performance impact: Altering activation functions could significantly impact the model's performance, potentially in unpredictable ways. The original parameters may not be optimized for different activation functions.

4. Technical feasibility: While theoretically possible, the practical implementation of such changes would depend on the specific GGUF implementation and runtime environment being used.

5. Legal and ethical considerations: Depending on the specific model and its license, modifying its behavior might have legal implications. There are also ethical considerations around altering AI models' behaviors.

6. Validation: Extensive testing would be necessary to ensure that any modifications don't introduce unintended behaviors or biases into the model's outputs.

If someone were to attempt this, they would need to have a deep understanding of the GGUF format, neural network architectures, and the specific implementation details of the runtime environment. It would likely involve modifying the code that interprets and executes the GGUF model, rather than changing the model file itself.

For most practical purposes, it's generally recommended to retrain models with the desired architecture changes rather than attempting to modify them at runtime. This ensures that the parameters are optimized for the new configuration.
