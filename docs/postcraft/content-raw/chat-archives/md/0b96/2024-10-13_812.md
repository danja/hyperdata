 Here's a list of the most common programming paradigms, followed by the minimum features needed for a Turing-complete language in each paradigm:

1. Procedural
2. Object-Oriented
3. Functional
4. Logic
5. Imperative
6. Declarative

Let's examine each paradigm:

1. Procedural:
Minimum features for Turing completeness:
- Variables and assignment
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Loops (while or for)
- Subroutines/procedures
- Basic arithmetic operations

2. Object-Oriented:
Minimum features for Turing completeness:
- Classes with methods
- Object instantiation
- Inheritance
- Variables and assignment
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Method invocation

3. Functional:
Minimum features for Turing completeness:
- First-class and higher-order functions
- Recursion
- Conditional expressions
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Lambda expressions (anonymous functions)

4. Logic:
Minimum features for Turing completeness:
- Facts and rules
- Unification
- Backtracking
- Recursion
- Cut operator (to control backtracking)

5. Imperative:
Minimum features for Turing completeness:
- Variables and assignment
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Sequence of instructions
- Basic arithmetic operations

6. Declarative:
Minimum features for Turing completeness:
- Pattern matching
- Recursion
- Higher-order functions
- Lazy evaluation
- Conditional expressions

It's worth noting that these are minimal feature sets, and many languages combine multiple paradigms or include additional features for practical use. Additionally, the imperative paradigm overlaps significantly with procedural, and declarative overlaps with functional and logic paradigms.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific paradigm or feature?
