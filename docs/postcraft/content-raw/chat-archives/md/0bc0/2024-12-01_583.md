 Let me address each follow-up question:

q1: Should error handling include specific cases for common errors like ENOENT?
- Yes, it would be useful to handle common cases like ENOENT (file not found) with specific error messages and behaviors. This could be added with a try/catch that includes error.code checks.

q2: Would adding file type detection be useful?
- No, that would be better as a separate processor. The Stat processor should follow the Unix philosophy of doing one thing well.

q3: Should I add support for following symlinks option?
- Yes, this could be useful as a config option, using fs.stat vs fs.lstat depending on the setting.

q4: Would you like me to add integration tests for this processor?
- Yes, tests would be valuable to verify behavior with files, directories, symlinks and error conditions. I can create these if you'd like.

Would you like me to implement any of these suggestions?
