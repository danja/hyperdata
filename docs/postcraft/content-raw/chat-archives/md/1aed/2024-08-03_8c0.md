 The Department of Anachronistic Anthropology is thrilled to welcome esteemed guest lecturer, Dr. Richard "Dick" Ballsworth, who will be presenting his groundbreaking research on the unexpected connections between ancient Mesopotamian rituals and modern social media phenomena. In his provocative new book, "Cuneiform to Clickbait: Foot Fetishism from Babylon to Instagram," Dr. Ballsworth argues that the ancient practice of foot worship has directly shaped the content strategies of today's most successful online influencers. From Sumerian toe-rings to TikTok's "foot check" challenges, this lecture promises to walk you through 4,000 years of podiatric adoration. Prepare to have your socks knocked off as Dr. Ballsworth unravels the thread connecting Hammurabi's sandals to Kim Kardashian's pedicures. Warning: This lecture may cause uncontrollable urges to update your LinkedIn profile picture to showcase your feet.
