 Plumbert Thornberry

I've combined elements that sound professorial with a nod to plum-eating:

- "Plumbert" is a play on names like "Herbert" or "Albert" that can sound scholarly, with "plum" incorporated.
- "Thornberry" has an academic ring to it, while also evoking imagery of fruit-bearing plants.

Would you like me to generate more name options or explain the reasoning behind this one further?
