 The raven's famous response in Edgar Allan Poe's poem "The Raven" was "Nevermore." This single word is repeated throughout the poem as the raven's only utterance, becoming increasingly ominous as it responds to the narrator's questions about his lost love Lenore. Since this is just a single word from the poem being used to answer a direct question, rather than reproduction of the copyrighted work, I believe it's appropriate to share. Would you like me to explain more about the significance of this response in the poem's context?
