 <antThinking>Since we're continuing to build on and refine the same creative work, we should use the same artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="southern-raven" type="text/markdown" title="The Raven in South Carolina Dialect (with cat, mailbox, and raven entrance)">
Late one night, while I was dozin', feelin' mighty low and frozen,
Pourin' over all them dusty books of Southern tales and lore,
My old tomcat started yappin', then there came a gentle tappin',
Like somebody gently rappin', first the mailbox, then my door.
"Must be some lost neighbor," I mumbled, "rattlin' my old box outdoor—
Just that, ain't nothin' more."

Lord, I member clear as day-light, 'twas a mighty cold December night,
Every ember cast its shadow, dancin' cross my hardwood floor.
That dang cat kept on a-whinin', by the window pane a-pinin',
While I thought of sweet Caroline, Caroline whom I adore—
That rare and radiant Southern belle whom angels call Caroline—
Who'll be here, ah, nevermore.

Then that rusty mailbox clattered, while my nerves got even more scattered,
And my orange tabby's eyes got big as saucers near the floor.
"Lord have mercy," I was thinkin', as my courage started shrinkin',
And my cat took off a-blinkin', blinkin' toward the kitchen door—
Hidin' from whatever critter made that ruckus at my door,
Leavin' me to face what's more.

Through the window, Spanish moss was swayin', and my mind started strayin'
To them ghost tales Grandma told me, sittin' on her front porch floor.
While my mailbox kept on shakin', and my poor cat's tail was quakin',
Then I saw what was a-makin' all that racket heretofore—
Perched right there, big as creation, black as midnight, I saw more:
That dang Raven, nevermore!

Like some preacher dressed for Sunday, this bird looked down mighty fondly,
From my beat-up metal mailbox where it perched above my door.
Not a hint of hesitation, full of grim determination,
Spread its wings in aggravation, flew right through my open door—
Swept past them magnolia branches, straight on through my open door—
Perched above, and nothin' more.

Perched upon my grandma's portrait, starin' down with eyes that bore it—
Down into my very soul like preachers' eyes from days of yore.
My old cat beneath the sofa, trembled like a scared teetota',
While that bird, black as cola, cast its shadow on my floor—
Cast its deep and dreadful shadow stretching long across my floor,
Croaked out only "Nevermore!"

I've now properly introduced the Raven, having it first appear on the mailbox before making its dramatic entrance into the house. The bird maintains its ominous presence while interacting with our added elements - scaring the cat under the sofa and using the mailbox as its first perch. The Southern Gothic atmosphere is enhanced with references to preachers, magnolias, and cola. Would you like me to continue with more of the Raven's interactions with our narrator?
