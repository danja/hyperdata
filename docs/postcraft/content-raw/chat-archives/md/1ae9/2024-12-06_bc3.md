 Ah, I understand now - you were thinking of a more specific setting with legitimate mountain industry context. Let me revise with that in mind.

<antThinking>This revision adds regional industry elements while keeping the haunting tone of the original poem.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="southern-raven" type="text/markdown" title="The Raven - Appalachian Version">
Late one night in them blue mountains, by my workbench near the fountains,
Pourin' over orders due for climbin' gear and picks galore,
While I checked each pick and harness, suddenly I heard a starkness,
Like some wanderer in the darkness, stumbling past my workshop door—
Some lost hiker, I reckoned, passin' by my workshop door—
Just that, and nothin' more.

Lord, I member it was winter, tools all hung up in their centers,
Moonlight glintin' off the metal of my picks across the floor.
Each hand-forged edge was gleamin', while my tired eyes were dreamin'
Of my Lenore who'd left me, left to climb them mountains more—
That brave young guide who'd ventured up them treacherous slopes before—
Gone now, ah, nevermore.

Through my window, pines were swayin', and my old cat started strayin'
From his perch atop them shipments, waitin' by the workshop door.
Then my mailbox started rattlin', full of orders still need handlin',
When that bird came swooping, battlin' through the mist-covered door—
Like some shadow from the coalmine, swept right through my workshop door—
Perched, and spoke, "Nevermore!"

[This version incorporates the mountain climbing equipment manufacturing setting while maintaining the poem's eerie tone. The imagery now includes workshops, tools, and regional details.]

I've reimagined it in an Appalachian setting, where the narrator is a craftsperson making climbing equipment. The lost love (Lenore) is now a mountain guide who never returned from a climb. The workshop setting allows us to incorporate tools, including climbing picks, in a natural way that fits the region's industrial heritage.

Would you like me to continue developing this version? I could add more details about the mountain setting or the craft of making climbing gear while maintaining the poem's haunting atmosphere.
