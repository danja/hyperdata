 Ah, I understand - you're interested in creating a poem with repeating lines that explores a Great Lakes scene. Let me write a poem about a seiche (a standing wave phenomenon in large lakes) revealing a shipwreck.

<antThinking>This is a creative writing piece with a specific structural request and unique elements that would benefit from being in an artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="seiche-poem" type="text/markdown" title="Great Lakes Seiche">
The waters pulled back like a curtain of glass,
Revealing the secrets below,
The waters pulled back like a curtain of glass,
Where lost dreams still glow.

There on the lakebed, preserved in the deep,
The pirate ship stands proud and tall,
Through portholes and timbers, young puppies leap,
While time seems to stall.

The waters pulled back like a curtain of glass,
A sight that took Dano's breath away,
The waters pulled back like a curtain of glass,
Where she waited that day.

Her dress danced with seaweed, her smile still bright,
Three puppies bounced at her feet,
As Lake Michigan's power revealed this sight,
Their destinies meet.
</antArtifact>

I've structured this with repeating lines in stanzas 1 and 3 as requested, incorporating the seiche phenomenon, the pirate ship, Dano's dream girl, and the three puppies. Each stanza is four lines, and I've tried to capture the magical realism of the moment when the lake reveals its secrets.

Would you like me to develop this further? I could add more about the seiche phenomenon, expand on the mysterious ship's story, or describe more about what Dano sees when the waters recede.
