 <antThinking>Let's expand the previous poem with more detail about the puppies while maintaining the same structure with repeating lines.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="seiche-poem" type="text/markdown" title="Great Lakes Seiche">
The waters pulled back like a curtain of glass,
Revealing the secrets below,
The waters pulled back like a curtain of glass,
Where lost dreams still glow.

Three pups bounced about with their newfound play,
One golden, one spotted, one black,
Their two-month-old whiskers all dripping with spray,
On their sunken-ship track.

The waters pulled back like a curtain of glass,
As they tumbled through time's frozen scene,
The waters pulled back like a curtain of glass,
Where nothing's as it seems.

The golden one's ears flapped like silk in the breeze,
The spotted one's paws danced with light,
While the black pup with bright eyes and knees weak with ease,
Made the whole scene feel right.

Round bellies still pudgy from puppyhood's grace,
They romped through the ghost captain's hold,
While water hung still in that time-frozen space,
Their story untold.

I've added detailed descriptions of three distinct puppies:
- A golden puppy with silky, flapping ears
- A spotted puppy with dancing paws
- A black puppy with bright eyes and wobbly legs

All three have the characteristic pudgy bellies of two-month-old puppies. Would you like me to develop their personalities more or focus on how they're interacting with the mysterious ship and Dano's dream girl?
