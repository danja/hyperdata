 Yes, there are some common conventions for creating test files to verify that your web server is functioning correctly. Here are a few options:

1. index.html: This is the most common default file for web servers. You could create a simple HTML file with a basic message.

2. favicon.ico: While not typically used for testing, it's a common file that browsers request.

3. robots.txt: This file is used to provide instructions to web crawlers, but it's also a lightweight file often used for quick checks.

4. health.html or status.html: These aren't standard, but they're sometimes used for health checks in more complex setups.

5. ping.html or test.html: Simple, descriptive names for test files.

Here's what I'd recommend:

1. Create a simple index.html file in each domain's root directory. For example:

For /home/www/hyperdata.it/index.html:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>hyperdata.it test page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>hyperdata.it is working!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

For /home/github/hyperdata/docs/ps.hyperdata.it/public/home/index.html:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>ps.hyperdata.it test page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>ps.hyperdata.it is working!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

2. You can test these with a simple GET request:

```
curl https://hyperdata.it
curl https://ps.hyperdata.it
```

These commands should return the HTML content of the respective index.html files.

3. If you prefer an even simpler test file, you could create a file named test.txt in each root directory with just a simple message:

```
echo "hyperdata.it test file" > /home/www/hyperdata.it/test.txt
echo "ps.hyperdata.it test file" > /home/github/hyperdata/docs/ps.hyperdata.it/public/home/test.txt
```

Then test with:

```
curl https://hyperdata.it/test.txt
curl https://ps.hyperdata.it/test.txt
```

These conventions allow for quick and easy testing of your domain configurations. Remember to remove or secure any test files before going into production if they contain sensitive information or if you don't want them publicly accessible.
