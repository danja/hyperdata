 The Indian side dish of yogurt and mint is called Raita.

Raita is a popular condiment in Indian cuisine that is made by mixing yogurt with various herbs, spices, and sometimes chopped vegetables or fruits. The most common version is a yogurt-based sauce or dip that is flavored with fresh mint leaves, along with ingredients like cumin, roasted cumin powder, chili powder, salt, and sometimes diced cucumber or other vegetables.

Raita is often served as a cooling, refreshing accompaniment to spicy Indian curries and rice dishes. It helps balance out the heat and provide a creamy, tangy contrast to the other flavors. It's a versatile side that can be customized with different mix-ins depending on personal preferences and regional variations.
