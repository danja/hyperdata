 Looking at OllamaConnector's usage, the model parameter is being passed as a Promise rather than a string. Let's trace and fix this.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



The Promise issue stems from the EmbeddingHandler's integration with MemoryManager. Let's fix that connection:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



The key changes are:
1. Strict type checking in EmbeddingHandler constructor
2. Removed Promise.resolve() hack from OllamaConnector
3. Added proper error handling for model parameter
4. Added JSDoc types for better code guidance

These changes ensure model names are proper strings throughout the call chain and prevent Promise objects from being accidentally passed.

Q1: Should we add validation for other parameters as well?
Q2: Would you like to see the error handling improved further?
Q3: Should we add model name format validation?
Q4: Would you like to see integration tests for this fix?
