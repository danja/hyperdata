 I'll refactor MemoryManager into more focused classes: core memory management, cache handling, and embedding operations.

<antThinking>The code needs breaking into logical components following single responsibility principle. Will create three main classes plus a types file for better organization.</antThinking>

The refactored code now has:

1. Clear separation of concerns with:
   - MemoryTypes: Type definitions and data structures
   - EmbeddingHandler: Embedding generation and standardization
   - CacheManager: Generic caching functionality
   - MemoryManager: Core memory operations and coordination

2. Improved maintainability through:
   - Smaller, focused classes
   - Clear interfaces between components
   - Better encapsulation of functionality
   - Consistent error handling

3. Key improvements:
   - Removed duplicate code
   - Better type safety with structured configs
   - More modular caching system
   - Cleaner promise handling

The core MemoryManager class is now much more focused on orchestration rather than implementation details.

Q1: Should we add TypeScript definitions for better type safety?
Q2: Would it be useful to extract the LLM operations into a separate handler?
Q3: Should we add an event system for monitoring memory operations?
Q4: Could we improve the interaction serialization for storage?
