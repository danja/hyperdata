 Acknowledged. I've analyzed the question and identified key components.

One-line summaries of tasks:
1. Research popular Node.js XMPP server implementations
2. Evaluate options based on criteria
3. Compare features and compliance
4. Assess community support and maintenance

Solution:
Prosody-io/node-xmpp-server is the most suitable option. It's a popular, actively maintained, standards-compliant XMPP server implementation for Node.js. It supports multi-user chat rooms and offers a comprehensive feature set. The project is open-source and hosted on GitHub.

q1: What are the key features of node-xmpp-server?
q2: How does node-xmpp-server compare to ejabberd in terms of performance?
q3: Are there any notable limitations of node-xmpp-server?
q4: What other XMPP libraries integrate well with node-xmpp-server?
