 I acknowledge that I have analyzed the question and identified key concepts and components required for a solution. I have also broken down the problem into small steps and individual tasks needed to reach the goal.

One-line summaries of tasks:
1. Identified undefined symbol "incorrect" in the expression.
2. Checked available symbols in the environment.
3. Determined that "incorrect" is not defined in the current scope.
4. Recognized an error in symbol lookup during evaluation.

Solution description:
The error occurred because the symbol "incorrect" is not defined in the current environment. The interpreter attempted to evaluate an expression containing this undefined symbol, resulting in a lookup error. To resolve this, the symbol "incorrect" needs to be defined or replaced with a valid symbol from the available list.

q1: What are the possible causes for an undefined symbol error in this context?
q2: How can we define new symbols in the Sheltopusik environment?
q3: What is the purpose of the "alternative" symbol in the original expression?
q4: How does the error handling mechanism work in the Sheltopusik interpreter?
