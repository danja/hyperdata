 Hmm, that's an interesting question about linguistic overlap. While I can think of phrases for regaining consciousness like "riprendere conoscenza" or "rinvenire," and terms for rotation like "girare" or "ruotare," I'm not aware of a single Italian phrase that captures both meanings like the English "coming around" does. However, since this is quite a specific linguistic question about Italian idioms, I should note that I may have missed or misremembered some expressions.

Would you like me to explore the specific phrases used in Italian for either meaning? I'd be curious to hear if you've encountered something like this in Italian usage.
