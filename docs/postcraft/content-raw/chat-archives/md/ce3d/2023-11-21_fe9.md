Here is an English translation of the Dante-inspired Italian version I created:

Oh sweet Claudio, your master is away  
and has entrusted you to me, his trusted friend.
I shall care for you fondly and attentively  
and nourish you with tasty food.

Two braziers will warm your bones
and I will light the hearth if you want to rest.
Do not worry about walks, my friend,
your master will take you out when he returns.

You will wear your colorful jacket  
if we go out to the driveway. You'll stay close to me,
for the fast carriages are great peril
for a distracted little dog like you.

In your bowl you will have plenty of crackers  
and delicious cans of goodness.
You will get cookies and prizes now and then 
to make your stay with me a happy one.

You will not lack fresh water,
I will put it in the bucket and in the bidet for you.  
You will do your business in the studio
and your master will pick it up when he returns.

Feel free to keep warm in the cellar, 
for I have switched the fridge off and emptied it.
The water pump is broken, I regret to say,
but it will soon be fixed.  

Oh sweet Claudio, rest assured 
that I will take good care of you.
You will return to your master very soon,
in the meantime, enjoy life with me!
