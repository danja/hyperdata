Here is the English translation of the revised Italian version with the reference to Marinella:

Oh sweet Claudio, your master away  
has entrusted you to Marinella, a helpful woman.  
She will lovingly take care of you  
and nourish you with delicious food.

Two braziers will warm your bones 
and she will light the hearth if you want to rest.
Do not worry about walks, furry friend, 
your master will take you out when he returns.

You will wear your colorful jacket
if you venture out to the driveway. Youâ€™ll stay close to her, 
for the fast carriages are great peril 
for a lively little dog like you.   

In your bowl you will have plenty of crackers  
and exquisite cans of goodness.  
You will get cookies and prizes now and then
to make your stay with her a happy one.

You will not lack fresh water, 
she will put it in the bucket and in the bidet for you.
You will do your business in the studio 
and your master will pick it up when he returns.

Feel free to keep warm in the cellar,
for she has switched the fridge off and emptied it. 
The water pump is broken, she says woefully,
but it will soon be fixed.  

Oh sweet Claudio, rest assured
that Marinella will take good care of you.  
You will return to your master soon,
in the meantime, enjoy life with her!
