  StringFilter Integration Tests
    Pattern Style Tests
      ✗ should handle comma-separated patterns
        - AssertionError: expected [] to have the same members as [ '*.txt', '*.log', 'temp.*' ]
      ✗ should handle multiple single patterns
        - AssertionError: expected [] to have the same members as [ '*.txt', '*.log', 'temp.*' ]
      ✗ should handle mixed pattern styles
        - AssertionError: expected [] to have the same members as [ Array(4) ]
    File Filtering Tests
      ✗ should correctly filter files with exclude patterns
        - AssertionError: expected 4 to equal 2
      ✗ should handle include and exclude patterns together
        - AssertionError: expected 4 to equal 2
    Edge Cases
      ✓ should handle empty patterns
      ✓ should handle invalid patterns gracefully
StringFilter: No filepath provided
      ✓ should handle null filepath
    Performance Tests
      ✓ should handle large pattern sets efficiently
      ✓ should process files quickly
