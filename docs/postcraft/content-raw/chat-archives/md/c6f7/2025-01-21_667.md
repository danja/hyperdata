 You're right - I apologize for the hasty response. Let's analyze this systematically:

1. The 0 of 0 specs indicates Jasmine isn't finding any test files. This likely means:
   - Test file location is incorrect
   - Test file naming doesn't match Jasmine's spec pattern
   - Test file imports are incorrect for ES modules

2. Looking at the project structure in the documents, integration tests should be in:
   `tests/integration/string-filter.spec.js`

<antThinking>Need a complete, correctly structured spec file with proper ES module imports and clear test organization. This warrants an artifact as it's a complete test suite that needs to maintain consistency with project structure.</antThinking>
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isnâ€™t yet supported on mobile.
```



I apologize for the artifact error. Let me explain the key issues and fixes needed:

1. The test file must be located at exactly:
   ```
   tests/integration/string-filter.spec.js
   ```

2. The key changes needed:
   - Fix import paths to use relative paths from test location
   - Add proper test file structure for Jasmine/Chai
   - Use actual filesystem operations rather than mocks
   - Ensure proper async/await handling
   - Add proper cleanup between tests

Would you like me to:

q1: Provide a complete working test file with correct paths?
q2: Show how to debug the test discovery issue?
q3: Provide a simpler test case first?
q4: Show the file structure requirements?
