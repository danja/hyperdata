 Solid Community Server does not directly integrate with LDAP or other central user management systems out-of-the-box. However, it is designed to work with WebID, which is a decentralized way of identifying users on the web.

With WebID, each user has a WebID profile document that contains information about them, including their public keys for authentication. This profile document is hosted somewhere on the web, often on the user's own Solid pod or server.

To authenticate with Solid Community Server using WebID, users provide the URL of their WebID profile document. The server then fetches this document, verifies the user's identity based on the public keys, and grants access accordingly.

While this approach is decentralized and aligns with Solid principles, it may not meet your need for a centralized user management system like LDAP. However, there are a few potential options:

1. **Custom integration**: You could develop a custom integration between Solid Community Server and your preferred user management system. This would involve writing code to handle user authentication and account management based on your central system.

2. **Use WebID-OIDC**: The WebID-OIDC project provides a bridge between WebID and standard OpenID Connect, which allows integrating WebID authentication with platforms that support OIDC. You could set up an OIDC provider and configure Solid Community Server to use it.

3. **Use an Identity Provider**: Some Identity Providers (IdPs) like Inrupt offer managed solutions that can integrate with Solid apps and provide user authentication and management. This could give you a more centralized approach, though at an additional cost.

Ultimately, the decentralized nature of Solid favors the WebID approach, but integrating with a central user management system will require some custom development work or the use of third-party solutions.
