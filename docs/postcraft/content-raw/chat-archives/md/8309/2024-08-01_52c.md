 It appears you're trying to establish an SSH connection to a host with IP address 192.168.0.10, but the connection is timing out. This could be due to several reasons:

1. The target machine may be offline or not reachable on the network.
2. There might be a firewall blocking the connection on either your machine or the target.
3. The SSH service may not be running on the target machine.
4. The IP address might be incorrect.
5. There could be network issues preventing the connection.

Here are some steps you can try to troubleshoot:

1. Verify that the IP address is correct.
2. Check if you can ping the target machine: `ping 192.168.0.10`
3. Ensure the target machine is powered on and connected to the network.
4. Check if the SSH service is running on the target machine.
5. Verify that port 22 (the default SSH port) is open on the target machine.
6. Check your firewall settings to ensure SSH traffic is allowed.

If you need more specific advice, please provide additional information about your network setup or any error messages you're seeing.
