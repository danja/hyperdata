 There are a few main approaches for a vanilla JavaScript app running in a browser to interact with local files:

1. File API:
The File API allows reading file contents selected by the user through an <input type="file"> element or drag-and-drop.

2. FileReader API:
This API enables asynchronous reading of file contents as text, data URLs, or ArrayBuffers.

3. FileSystem API:
Though less supported, this API allows creation, reading, and writing of files in a sandboxed file system.

4. IndexedDB:
While not directly for file access, it can store and retrieve large amounts of structured data, including files.

5. Web Storage (localStorage/sessionStorage):
Useful for storing smaller amounts of data, but not ideal for large files.

6. Blob API:
Allows creation and manipulation of Blob objects representing file-like data.

7. URL.createObjectURL():
Creates a URL for a Blob, which can be used to reference the file data.

It's important to note that for security reasons, browsers restrict direct access to the local file system. These APIs provide controlled ways to work with user-selected files or to store data locally within the browser's sandbox.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or provide code examples?
