 The approach you're describing doesn't have a specific, widely-recognized name in software development methodologies, but it shares elements with several existing practices and principles. Let's break down the key aspects of your approach and relate them to known methodologies:

1. Use of AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT) for development
2. Employing projects and custom system prompts
3. Utilizing repopack for code collation and context management
4. Focusing on small, independent components
5. Increased emphasis on testing
6. Creating simplified, imperative-style runners for declarative systems
7. Balancing between unit and integration tests

This approach combines elements of:

1. Agile Development: Your focus on iterative development, adapting to AI limitations, and emphasis on testing aligns with Agile principles.

2. Extreme Programming (XP): The increased focus on testing and creating small, independent components is reminiscent of XP practices.

3. Test-Driven Development (TDD): Your approach to creating more tests with AI assistance reflects aspects of TDD.

4. Modular Programming: The emphasis on small, independent components aligns with modular programming principles.

5. AI-Augmented Development: Your use of AI tools throughout the development process is part of an emerging trend in software development.

6. Continuous Integration (CI): The practice of frequently integrating code changes and running tests is implied in your workflow.

While there isn't a specific name for this exact combination of practices, it could be described as "AI-Assisted Agile Development with Emphasis on Modularity and Testing" or perhaps "AI-Augmented Modular TDD."

The use of simplified runners for declarative systems is an interesting approach that doesn't have a widely-used name, but it's conceptually similar to creating "simulators" or "mock environments" for complex systems. This practice allows for faster iteration and testing of components in isolation.

If you're looking to name this approach, you might consider something like "Declarative-Imperative Hybrid Testing" or "Selective Context AI-Assisted Development" to capture the essence of your methodology.

It's worth noting that as AI-assisted development evolves, we may see more formal methodologies emerge that incorporate these practices. Your approach seems to be at the forefront of adapting existing best practices to work effectively with AI assistance in software development.
