 I apologize for the oversight. You're correct that you've already implemented some of the suggested changes. Let's focus on where to add the explicit `process.binding` no-op function.

Based on the source you've provided, your entry point is likely `src/index.js`. This is where we should add the code to set `process.binding` to a no-op function. Here's how you can modify `src/index.js`:

1. Open `src/index.js`

2. At the very top of the file, before any imports or other code, add the following:

```javascript
if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
  window.process = window.process || {};
  window.process.binding = function () {};
}

// Rest of your existing code follows...
import fs from 'fs/promises'
import path from 'path'
import beautify from 'simply-beautiful'
// ... rest of your imports and code
```

This addition should be placed at the beginning of the file to ensure it's executed before any other code that might try to use `process.binding`.

If this doesn't resolve the issue, we might need to look at how the bundled code is being used in the browser. The error could be coming from a dependency that's not being properly transformed for browser use.

Q1: After making this change, does the error persist?
Q2: Are you able to see where in the bundled code the error is being thrown?
Q3: Have you tried using source maps to pinpoint the exact location of the error in your pre-bundled code?
