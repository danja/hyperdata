 The error you're encountering is related to the `process` object, which is typically available in Node.js environments but not in browsers. This error suggests that some code is trying to access `process.binding`, which is not supported in browser environments.

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the browser-compatible versions of Node.js core modules are being used. Here are some steps to address this:

1. Make sure you have the necessary polyfills installed:
   ```
   npm install process browserify-zlib stream-browserify util
   ```

2. Update your webpack configuration to include these polyfills:

```javascript
import webpack from 'webpack';
import path from 'path';

export default {
  // ... other configurations
  plugins: [
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
      process: 'process/browser',
    }),
  ],
  resolve: {
    fallback: {
      "zlib": require.resolve("browserify-zlib"),
      "stream": require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
      "util": require.resolve("util/"),
      "process": require.resolve("process/browser")
    }
  }
};
```

3. If you're using any libraries that depend on Node.js core modules, you may need to add more polyfills or mock implementations for browser compatibility.

4. Consider using a tool like Browserify or webpack with the appropriate configuration to bundle your Node.js code for the browser.

5. Review your code and third-party dependencies to ensure they're not using Node.js-specific APIs that aren't available in the browser.

Q1: Are you using any Node.js-specific libraries that might be causing this issue?

Q2: Have you configured webpack to handle Node.js core modules in the browser environment?

Q3: Are there any specific parts of your code that are trying to access `process.binding`?
