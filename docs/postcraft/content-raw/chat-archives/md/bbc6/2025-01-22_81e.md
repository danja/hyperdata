 Essential property preservation across abstraction levels involves identifying invariants - characteristics that must remain constant despite changing levels of detail. Here's how we determine these:

Functional invariants:
Core behaviors and capabilities that define the system's purpose must be preserved. For example, in a mechanical system, key force relationships and energy transfers remain constant even when abstracted.

Structural invariants:
Critical relationships between components persist across levels. Like load-bearing elements in architecture - while detailed design may change, key support relationships cannot be violated.

Behavioral invariants:
System responses to inputs and state changes must remain consistent. Think of a control system - whether viewed at circuit level or block diagram level, input-output relationships stay fixed.

Constraint invariants:
Physical laws, resource limits, and domain rules must be respected at all abstraction levels. For instance, conservation of energy applies whether modeling individual components or whole systems.

q1: How can we formally verify that essential properties are maintained during abstraction?

q2: What techniques help identify hidden dependencies that might be lost during abstraction?

q3: How do we handle emergent properties that only appear at certain abstraction levels?

q4: What methods exist for documenting property preservation requirements?
