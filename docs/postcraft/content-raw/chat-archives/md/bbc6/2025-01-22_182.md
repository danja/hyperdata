 I acknowledge having analyzed the key aspects and requirements. Let me present the core solution components:

Decomposition formalization:
- Defined through hierarchical task networks with clear entry/exit criteria
- Each subtask maps to specific cognitive operations
- Dependencies and information flow explicitly stated

Abstraction mechanisms:
- Pattern recognition through feature extraction
- Solution space mapping using domain-independent primitives
- Analogical reasoning framework based on structural alignment

Primary research areas:
Cognitive architectures (SOAR, ACT-R), case-based reasoning, analogical problem solving, hierarchical planning

Recommended approach: Start with hierarchical task decomposition patterns, then layer abstraction capabilities through analogical mapping mechanisms.

q1: How can we formally represent the dependencies between decomposed subtasks?

q2: What existing frameworks exist for measuring abstraction level in problem descriptions?

q3: How can we validate that a decomposition is complete and sufficient?

q4: What mechanisms exist for identifying when abstraction would be more efficient than decomposition?

Let me know if you'd like to explore any of these aspects further.
