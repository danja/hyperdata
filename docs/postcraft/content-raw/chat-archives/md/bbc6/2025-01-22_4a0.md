 I'll create a document outlining a system for LLMs to explore these problem-solving approaches.

<antThinking>This document needs to provide clear, structured guidance for LLMs while maintaining flexibility for different problem types. It should be comprehensive enough to serve as a standalone framework but modular enough to allow adaptation. Given its length and importance as a reference, it warrants an artifact.</antThinking>

I've created a comprehensive framework for LLMs to approach complex problem-solving tasks. The framework emphasizes systematic thinking while maintaining flexibility for different problem types.

q1: Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspects of the framework?

q2: Should I add more specific examples of how to implement certain phases?

q3: Would you like additional guidance on handling edge cases or unusual problem types?

q4: Should I include more detail about the validation and refinement process?
