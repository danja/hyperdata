 Addressing abstraction frameworks and terminology:

Existing measurement frameworks:
- Cognitive Complexity Index (CCI) measures conceptual distance between abstraction levels
- Rasmussen's Abstraction Hierarchy provides structured levels from physical to functional
- Goal-Means decomposition frameworks quantify abstraction through functional relationships

Abstraction vs Decomposition efficiency triggers:
- When pattern recognition reveals structural similarities across multiple instances
- If decomposition creates more complexity than it resolves
- When solution transfer from analogous domains is possible
- If component interactions are more significant than individual parts

Key abstraction vocabulary:
Vertical movement: "lifting" (abstracting upward), "grounding" (making concrete)
Horizontal movement: "bridging" (analogical mapping), "transfer" (solution adaptation)
Levels: "grain size", "granularity", "resolution", "scope"
Operations: "chunking", "encapsulation", "black-boxing", "factoring"

q1: How can we detect when an abstraction level is optimal for a given problem?

q2: What metrics exist for measuring analogical distance between problems?

q3: How can we formalize the relationship between abstraction levels?

q4: What role does context play in determining appropriate abstraction levels?
