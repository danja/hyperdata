I'm exploring options for using multiple intelligent agents to solve problems in concert. Options I currently know of are LLM function calling, messaging via a pub sub broker and or following the pattern of multi-user chat where messages containing problem descriptions, requirement specifications are sent by agents into some kind of chatroom in some kind of lingua franca. Other agents in the chatroom, if they are interested - Ie. Have relevant capability may engage in conversation, perhaps changing language, and help solve the problem. Can you give me a brief point-by-point description of the characteristics of potential approaches, together with the pros and cons of each in regard to different kinds of problems
