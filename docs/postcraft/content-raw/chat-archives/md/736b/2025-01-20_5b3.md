 I have analyzed the Fuseki lock file issue and identified the key components involved.

Solution summary:
The Fuseki database is experiencing a lock file conflict between two JVM processes (PID 8 and 9) trying to access the same TDB database location. This requires implementing proper lock file cleanup during container startup/shutdown.

Critical tasks completed:
1. Identified lock file location: /fuseki/system/
2. Confirmed concurrent access attempt by PIDs 8 and 9
3. Determined TDB exclusive access requirement
4. Located relevant docker-compose configuration

Recommended solution:
Add a cleanup script to remove stale lock files before Fuseki startup in the Docker container initialization process.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isnâ€™t yet supported on mobile.
```



q1: How should the initialization script be integrated into the Docker container?
q2: What additional error handling would make the solution more robust?
q3: Are there any performance implications of removing lock files on startup?
q4: How can we verify the lock file cleanup was successful?
