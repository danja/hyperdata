 The word you're referring to is likely "shibboleth."

A shibboleth is a word or pronunciation that distinguishes people from different groups or places. It comes from a biblical story in the Book of Judges, where the Gileadites used the word "shibboleth" to identify and capture fleeing Ephraimites who couldn't pronounce the "sh" sound correctly, instead saying "sibboleth."

While the original story is from Hebrew scripture, the term "shibboleth" has become widely used in English and other languages to describe any distinguishing practice that sets one group apart from another, especially in terms of pronunciation or word usage.

In modern usage, a shibboleth can refer to any custom, phrase, or use of language that identifies someone as a member of a particular group. It's not limited to identifying spies but can be used in various contexts to distinguish insiders from outsiders.

Would you like me to elaborate on the historical context or modern usage of this term?
