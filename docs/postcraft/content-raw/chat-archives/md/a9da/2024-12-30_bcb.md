 Let me analyze this task and create a SPARQL-based store implementation.

<antThinking>
This requires creating a complete source file that implements a storage interface using SPARQL endpoints. Since it's a full implementation file with multiple methods and will be over 20 lines, it's appropriate for an artifact.

```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isnâ€™t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've created a SPARQLStore implementation that follows the same pattern as JSONStore while adapting it for SPARQL specifics. The store uses named graphs for isolation and implements transaction support using graph backup/restore operations.

Q1: Would you like to see an example of how to instantiate and use this store with the configuration?

Q2: Should we add support for SPARQL dataset versioning to track memory evolution over time?

Q3: Would you like to see the SHACL shapes that could validate the RDF data this store generates?

Q4: Should we implement query result caching to improve performance for frequently accessed patterns?
