 I'll split the backup tests into core backup and advanced backup functionality.

<antThinking>The backup tests should be split into two logical groups: basic backup/restore operations and advanced scenarios like corruption handling and incremental backups.</antThinking>

I've split the backup tests into two focused suites:

1. SPARQLStoreBasicBackup.spec.js:
   - Core backup/restore functionality
   - Transaction management
   - Basic data integrity

2. SPARQLStoreAdvancedBackup.spec.js:
   - Corruption handling
   - Incremental backups
   - Concurrent operations
   - Large dataset management
   - Integrity verification

Each suite uses its own test graph namespace to avoid conflicts.

Q1: Would you like to see tests for backup compression to handle very large datasets?

Q2: Should we add tests for backup versioning to track changes over time?

Q3: Would you like to see tests for backup validation using SHACL shapes?

Q4: Should we add tests for backup replication across multiple endpoints?
