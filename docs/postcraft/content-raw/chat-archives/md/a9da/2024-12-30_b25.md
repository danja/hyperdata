 I'll provide example usage and implement query caching.

<antThinking>These implementations deserve artifacts as they are complete source files with significant functionality. The example should be in its own file and the caching implementation requires extending the original store.</antThinking>

The implementations include:
1. Example showing how to instantiate and use SPARQLStore with the config system
2. CachedSPARQLStore that extends SPARQLStore with LRU caching for query results

The cache implementation includes automatic cleanup of expired entries and size management.

Q1: Would you like to see some unit tests for these implementations?

Q2: Should we add more sophisticated cache strategies like query result prefetching?

Q3: Would you like to add monitoring capabilities to track cache performance?

Q4: Should we implement batch operations to optimize multiple memory updates?
