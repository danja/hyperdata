 To identify the RDF classes and OWL classes in the given Turtle document, I'll analyze the content and create two lists. Then I'll compare them to identify the differences.

RDF Classes:
1. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Agent>
2. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Environment>
3. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Goal>
4. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Module>
5. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Project>
6. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Session>
7. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Task>
8. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/TaskList>

OWL Classes:
1. :SoftGoal
2. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Agent>
3. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Environment>
4. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Goal>
5. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Module>
6. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Project>
7. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Session>
8. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Task>
9. <http://purl.org/stuff/project/TaskList>

Differences between the two lists:

1. The OWL Classes list includes ":SoftGoal" which is not present in the RDF Classes list. This is because ":SoftGoal" is defined as an OWL class (rdf:type owl:Class) and is a subclass of <http://purl.org/stuff/project/Goal>.

2. All classes in the RDF Classes list are also present in the OWL Classes list. This is because in OWL, all classes are also considered RDF classes.

3. The OWL Classes list is more specific in its classification, as it uses the owl:Class type to define classes, while the RDF Classes are inferred from their usage in the document (e.g., as domains or ranges of properties).

In summary, the main difference is the inclusion of the ":SoftGoal" class in the OWL Classes list, which demonstrates the additional expressivity that OWL provides over basic RDF schemas.
