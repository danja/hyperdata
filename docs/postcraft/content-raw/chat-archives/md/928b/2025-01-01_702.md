 Ah, these errors point to specific Fuseki configuration and protocol issues:

1. The 415 (Unsupported Media Type) error occurs because Fuseki expects Turtle uploads through its `/upload` endpoint, not the SPARQL update endpoint. Also, Fuseki uses specific parameters for graph specification.

2. For the CONSTRUCT issue, it's failing because of the first problem.

3. The authentication test is failing because Fuseki might not be configured with authentication or handles it differently.

Let me modify both artifacts to work with Fuseki's specific requirements:

<antThinking>These changes are substantial enough to warrant full rewrites of both files to handle Fuseki-specific behaviors.</antThinking>

Key changes made:
1. Modified Turtle upload to use Fuseki's `/upload` endpoint with FormData
2. Changed auth test to expect specific error behavior
3. Added verification step after Turtle upload
4. Used SPARQL Update for initial data in CONSTRUCT test

Q1: Should we add specific Fuseki endpoint configuration validation?
Q2: Would adding Fuseki server status checks improve test reliability?
Q3: Should we implement Fuseki-specific backup/restore operations?
Q4: Would adding dataset management operations be useful?
