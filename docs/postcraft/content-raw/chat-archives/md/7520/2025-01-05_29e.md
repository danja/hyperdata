Can you reword the text below so it is much shorter while keeping the same points, and with an informal tone, I'd like it to be easy to to read out, I want it to grab the attention of a man in pr. "Can we counter nonsense with schoolyard ridicule? Populist politicians and their allies (you know exactly who I have in mind) use mad exaggerated narratives and even blatant lies to great advantage. It may be total rubbish, but they seem immune to the obvious rational response of countering with logic and facts. The only alternative would seem to be playing the same game, but that seems morally questionable, losing the high ground. But maybe schoolboy humour is a reasonable compromise? I'd love to hear your take on this, what other strategies are available, and (for the fun of it) any historical cases you know of where childish PR has been successful."
