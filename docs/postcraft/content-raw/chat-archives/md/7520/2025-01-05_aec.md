 Here's a punchier, more conversational version:

"Hey, here's a thought - what if we fought political BS with playground tactics? You've seen how certain politicians get away with crazy stories and flat-out lies, right? Facts and logic bounce right off them. We could stoop to their level, but that feels wrong. So what about good old-fashioned mockery instead? Let me know what you think - and hey, got any fun examples where childish PR actually worked?"

This shorter version keeps the key elements - the dilemma between taking the high road versus fighting fire with fire, and the specific suggestion of using humor as a middle ground. I've made it more direct and informal, which should work well for speaking aloud to a PR professional. Would you like me to adjust the tone further?
