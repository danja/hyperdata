 As an expert JavaScript programmer, I've considered your requirements and have some recommendations for vector databases that meet your criteria.

For the lightweight, self-contained NodeJS option:
1. Qdrant: Offers in-memory storage, easy setup, and NodeJS client.

For the more capable, scalable option:
1. Milvus: Highly scalable, supports Ubuntu, has NodeJS SDK.

Here's a brief comparison:

Qdrant:
- Lightweight, self-contained
- Rust-based with NodeJS client
- Supports payload (arbitrary fields)
- Has REST API
- Active development, growing community

Milvus:
- Highly scalable
- Runs on Ubuntu
- NodeJS SDK available
- Supports scalar fields
- REST API via Attu
- Large community, well-maintained

Recommendation: Use Qdrant for local development and Milvus for production/scale.

Q1: How would you structure a common JS interface for these vector DBs?
Q2: What are the key performance differences between Qdrant and Milvus?
Q3: Are there any licensing considerations for these databases?
Q4: How do these options compare in terms of query capabilities?
