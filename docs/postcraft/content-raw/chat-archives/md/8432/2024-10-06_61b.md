# [Recommendations for Open Source Vector Databases](https://claude.ai/chat/8432a9a1-098e-4a6e-b101-fe85c9e9ffd8)

 Given these requirements, let's reassess the options:

1. Voy:
+ Pure TypeScript (compiles to JavaScript)
+ In-memory storage
+ Supports cosine similarity and Euclidean distance
+ Simple API, potentially extensible
- Lacks built-in disk storage
- Limited range of similarity metrics

2. vector-db:
+ Pure JavaScript
+ Simple API
+ Potentially extensible
- Limited features
- Unclear support for on-disk storage

3. Faiss.js:
+ Pure JavaScript port of Faiss
+ Supports multiple algorithms including HNSW
+ Wide range of similarity metrics
- Primarily focused on in-memory operations
- May have performance limitations compared to native implementations

Recommendation: Faiss.js

Faiss.js offers the best balance of pure JavaScript implementation, support for various similarity metrics (including HNSW), and extensibility. However, you'll need to implement on-disk storage yourself, possibly using Node.js file system operations.

To meet all your requirements, you might need to create a wrapper around Faiss.js that adds:
1. On-disk storage functionality
2. Any additional similarity metrics you require
3. An extensibility layer for adding new algorithms

Q1: Are you comfortable with implementing the on-disk storage layer yourself?
Q2: What specific similarity metrics, beyond those in Faiss.js, do you anticipate needing?
Q3: How large are the vector datasets you expect to work with locally?
Q4: Would you consider a hybrid approach, using Faiss.js for vector operations and another library for persistence?
