I need two open source vector dbs to use with a corpus of mixed documents. One lightweight, self-contained nodejs to run and develop against locally. Another, more capable at scale, backend implementation unimportant but it must run on an Ubuntu server and have nodejs bindings. I will need to write a common JS interface to be able to switch between them, and potentially other stores easily. They should have support for attaching arbitrary fields to vectors. Existing http REST interfaces are desirable. Popularity and maintenance are considerations for ranking them.   What are the options? Which would you recommend?
