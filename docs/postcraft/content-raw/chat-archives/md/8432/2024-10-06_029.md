 There isn't a universally adopted standard for vector store APIs, but there are emerging patterns and some efforts towards standardization:

1. OpenAI Embeddings API: While not a vector store itself, its format for vector data is often used as a reference.

2. Langchain VectorStore interface: Provides a common abstraction layer for various vector stores.

3. Qdrant REST API: Often referenced as a well-designed API for vector stores.

4. Pinecone API: Another commonly used reference point for vector store APIs.

However, true standardization is still in progress. Most implementations have similar concepts but differ in specifics.

Q1: Would you prefer to design your interface based on an existing API or create a custom one?
Q2: What specific operations are most important for your use case?
Q3: How important is cross-platform compatibility in your API design?
Q4: Are there any specific performance metrics you want to track through your API?
