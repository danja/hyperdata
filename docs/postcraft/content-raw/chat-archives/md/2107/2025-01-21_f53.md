 I'll analyze the task and implement a systematic solution, starting with extracting the property handling logic from Processor to ProcessorSettings.

<antThinking>This task requires careful refactoring with test-driven development, with ProcessorSettings playing a central role. The core functionality should move to ProcessorSettings.js first, as indicated by the action plan in the documents.</antThinking>

I'll now create an updated StringFilter that uses the new functionality properly:

The implementation follows these key points:

1. Moved property handling logic to ProcessorSettings.js with support for both single and multiple values
2. Implemented getValues() in ProcessorSettings to handle:
   - Direct property values
   - Referenced settings values
   - Comma-separated values
   - Fallback values
3. Updated Processor.js to delegate to ProcessorSettings
4. Simplified StringFilter to use the new getValues() functionality
5. Added comprehensive tests for ProcessorSettings

This implementation:
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Supports both TTL patterns
- Provides clear separation of concerns
- Includes robust error handling
- Has comprehensive test coverage

q1: Would you like me to create integration tests for StringFilter?
q2: Should I add TypeScript type definitions?
q3: Would you like performance benchmarks for the new implementation?
q4: Should I provide migration documentation for existing processors?
