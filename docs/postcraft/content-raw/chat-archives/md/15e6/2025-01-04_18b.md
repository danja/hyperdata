# [Optimizing File Transmission Pipeline](https://claude.ai/chat/15e6b80d-5886-461a-8a76-680c1657b52e)

 Let me analyze the issue and propose a solution.

<antThinking>This looks like a file processing pipeline issue where there's a type mismatch with file paths. The error occurs in FileReader when trying to join paths. I'll need to create new artifacts for the Packer application components.</antThinking>

Key changes made:

1. Added proper configuration for file paths and filters
2. Restructured transmission pipeline to use CaptureAll and WhiteboardToMessage
3. Updated FileContainer to handle file paths properly and maintain state

The error was caused by incorrect path handling in the pipeline. The new version:
- Uses normalized paths
- Maintains state in FileContainer
- Aggregates results using the whiteboard pattern
- Properly handles done signals

q1: Would you like me to add error handling for invalid file paths?
q2: Should I implement the FileWriter stage for the container output?
q3: Would you like to add file metadata collection (size, mime type, etc.)?
q4: Should I add support for binary files with base64 encoding?
