 Yes, there were a few Atom packages that implemented multi-window features. One notable example was "atom-shell-commands" which allowed running terminal commands in separate windows, and "split-to-new-window" which enabled splitting panes into new windows.

Looking at the codebase and available code, the key extension points that made these work were:

1. The `atom.open()` API
2. `atom.workspace` flexibility in handling external windows
3. The built-in IPC mechanisms in Electron

The closest modern equivalent would be building on top of Pulsar's existing window handling code in `src/main-process/atom-window.js` which already handles some multi-window scenarios.

Most relevant legacy implementations relied on:

```javascript
atom.workspace.open(uri, {
  split: 'right',
  newWindow: true,
  searchAllPanes: false
});
```

Adapting this pattern to Pulsar would be the most compatible approach for existing packages and users.

Q1: How did the legacy atom-shell-commands handle process persistence across window closures?

Q2: What synchronization mechanisms were used between split windows in the split-to-new-window package?

Q3: How can we maintain backward compatibility with existing Pulsar/Atom packages while implementing new multi-window features?
