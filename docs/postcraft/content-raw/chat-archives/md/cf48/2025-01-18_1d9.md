 Let me address each follow-up question:

Q1: Would you like to see the updated REPLHandler with this command system?
- This would involve modifying REPLHandler to use the new CommandRegistry for all commands, improving code organization and extensibility.

Q2: Should we add specific command categories for chat and RDF modes?
- We could create dedicated categories for chat/RDF commands, allowing better organization and mode-specific functionality.

Q3: Would you like to add persistent context storage?
- We could save context between sessions, similar to how we handle command history.

Q4: Should we implement specific middleware for command logging or validation?
- Adding middleware for logging command usage and validating mode-specific commands would improve debugging and reliability.

Let me know which aspect you'd like me to implement first, or if you'd prefer a different direction.
