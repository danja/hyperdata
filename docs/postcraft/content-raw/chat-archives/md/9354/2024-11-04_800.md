 Ah, going for a pure metal resonator-style sound! Without the skin, tone rings and resonators become even more important. Here's how to enhance your metal dog bowl's sound:

Tone Rings:
1. A tone ring is essentially a metal ring that sits inside the rim of your bowl. It adds:
   - Mass (which increases sustain)
   - Stiffness (which improves high-frequency response)
   - Additional resonating surface

You could create one by:
- Using brass or steel rod bent into a circle
- Fitting copper pipe around the bowl's rim
- Using a large metal washer if you find one that fits

Resonators:
There are several approaches to resonators:

1. Spider-Style:
   - A thin metal disk (aluminum works well) suspended under the bridge
   - Supported by 3-4 small legs or posts
   - Creates a bright, projecting sound
   - Works well in a dog bowl because it doesn't need much depth

2. Cone-Style:
   - A cone-shaped piece of thin aluminum or brass
   - Point facing downward
   - Bridge sits on the wide part of the cone
   - Creates that classic bluesy resonator sound
   - You might need a deeper bowl for this style

3. Simple Plate:
   - A flat piece of thin metal suspended under the bridge
   - Easier to make than a cone
   - Less dramatic effect but still adds character

Installation Tips:
- The resonator should not touch the bowl except at its mounting points
- Use rubber or felt at mounting points to prevent unwanted buzzing
- The bridge should make good contact with your resonating element
- Consider drilling small sound holes in the bottom of the bowl
- Keep everything as lightweight as possible - thin metal sounds better

Would you like me to go into more detail about building any of these specific resonator styles?
