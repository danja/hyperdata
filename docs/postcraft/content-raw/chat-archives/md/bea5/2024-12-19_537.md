 In the TP-Link router menu shown in the image, you'll need to go to:

1. First "Forwarding" in the left menu
2. Inside there, look for "Virtual Servers" or "Port Forwarding" option

For the DHCP reservation (to set static local IP):
1. Go to "DHCP" in the menu
2. Look for "Address Reservation" or "DHCP Reservation" section

Both of these settings will likely be in sub-menus that appear after clicking the main menu items.

q1: What ports exactly do you want to forward?
q2: Do you know the MAC address of your local machine?
q3: What is your current local IP address?
q4: Would you like to set up both HTTP and HTTPS forwarding?
