 Let me explain from the beginning, with the key components:

1. You want a computer at home to be available at `mozzpoly.hyperdata.it`
2. You have a remote server (178.79.189.240) running nginx
3. Your home network has a router with an IP that can change
4. Your local computer is behind this router

Steps needed:
1. Your Home Computer:
   - Run web service (Express) on port 4444
   - Tell the router to forward incoming traffic to your computer

2. Your Router:
   - Set port forwarding from internet → local computer
   - Keep track of its internet IP address when it changes

3. Remote Server:
   - Get updates about your home IP address
   - Use nginx to forward mozzpoly.hyperdata.it → your home computer

Would you like me to explain any of these parts in more detail?

q1: Should we start by setting up the Express server?
q2: Would you like to test the router forwarding first?
q3: Shall we begin with the remote server setup?
q4: Would you like a diagram of how it all connects?
