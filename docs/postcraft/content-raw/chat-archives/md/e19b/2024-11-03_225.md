 No, I apologize - I oversimplified. Carrots are cone-like but with a curved taper and pointed tip, more accurately described as a paraboloid. The tip curves to a point rather than having a flat end, making volume calculations even more complex.

q1: What's the mathematical curve that best describes a typical carrot's profile?
q2: How much does the tip curvature vary between carrot varieties?
q3: At what point does the taper typically begin to curve more sharply?
q4: How does growth speed affect the tip formation?
