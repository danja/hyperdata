 Let me address each follow-up question:

1. Fractional carrots: Cut each remaining carrot into 10 equal pieces, giving each person 2 whole carrots plus 1/10th of a carrot.

2. Unwanted towel share: Redistribute that person's 0.5 towel portion among interested parties, making it approximately 0.56 towels each for 9 people.

3. Household distribution: Yes, grouping by household would be more practical, especially for shared items like towels. Would need household size data to calculate.

4. Uneven preferences: Create a preference matrix, allow trading between participants, or implement a round-robin selection system with weighted choices.

q1: What's the most efficient way to cut carrots into equal portions?
q2: How would you track who received what in a large distribution?
q3: What's the minimum viable portion size for fair distribution?
q4: How do you handle quality differences in distributed items?
