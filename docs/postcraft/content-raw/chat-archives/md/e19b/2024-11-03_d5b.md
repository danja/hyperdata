 No, carrots are conical - they taper from a wider top to a narrower tip. This means simple length-based division won't create equal portions.

Better approach: Cut into cross-sectional rings first, then redistribute based on volume/weight to create truly equal portions.

q1: How does the tapering ratio of typical carrots affect portion calculations?
q2: Would cutting longitudinal wedges be more equitable than cross-sections?
q3: How do different carrot varieties affect the distribution approach?
q4: What's the mathematical formula for carrot volume given length and diameters?
