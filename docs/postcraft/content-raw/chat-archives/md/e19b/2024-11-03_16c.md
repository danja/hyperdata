 Acknowledged. Analysis complete. Task breakdown done.

Simple division calculation:
- Carrots: 21 รท 10 = 2.1 carrots per person
- Towels: 5 รท 10 = 0.5 towels per person
- Bacon: 0 รท 10 = 0 bacon per person

Solution: Each person receives 2.1 carrots, half a towel, and no bacon.

q1: How would you handle the fractional carrots practically?
q2: What if one person doesn't want their share of towels?
q3: Would it be more efficient to distribute items by household instead?
q4: How would you handle uneven distribution preferences?
