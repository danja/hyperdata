 I have analyzed the codebase and found that the fibonacci example and sp execution script seem to have a function serialization issue.

One-line summaries of tasks completed:
1. Verified issue with function execution in fibonacci example
2. Located interpreter code that handles function evaluation
3. Found missing function-to-string conversion in the execution path
4. Identified solution requires proper function stringification

Solution: The interpreter needs to properly handle function return values by either stringifying functions or evaluating them immediately on return. The most direct fix is to modify the evaluator.js file to ensure functions are executed rather than returned as opaque objects.

q1: Should we modify the evaluator to automatically execute returned functions?
q2: Would adding a function stringification helper be a better approach? 
q3: Is this related to how lambda functions are being handled?
q4: Should we add a test case specifically for function return values?
