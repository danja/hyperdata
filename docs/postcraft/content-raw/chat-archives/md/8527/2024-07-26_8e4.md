 The role of the striatum in ADHD has been a subject of considerable research, but like many areas in neuroscience, the picture is complex. Let's break down the current state of evidence:

Observational Evidence:

1. Neuroimaging studies:
   - Structural MRI: Several studies have found reduced volume in striatal regions, particularly the caudate, in individuals with ADHD. This evidence is fairly consistent, but not universal.
   - Functional MRI: Multiple studies have shown altered activation patterns in the striatum during tasks involving attention, reward processing, and inhibition. This evidence is moderately strong but with some variability in findings.

2. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies:
   - Have shown reduced dopamine release and receptor binding in the striatum in ADHD. This evidence is quite consistent but based on a smaller number of studies due to the technique's invasiveness.

3. Genetics:
   - Several genes involved in dopamine signaling in the striatum (e.g., DAT1, DRD4) have been associated with ADHD risk. This evidence is moderate but complicated by the polygenic nature of ADHD.

4. Pharmacological evidence:
   - The effectiveness of stimulant medications, which primarily act on dopamine systems in the striatum, provides indirect support for striatal involvement. This evidence is strong but indirect.

5. Animal models:
   - Studies in animals with manipulated striatal function show ADHD-like behaviors. This evidence is strong in animal models but requires careful translation to humans.

Hypotheses and Limitations:

1. Causality: While striatal differences are observed in ADHD, it's not always clear if these are causes, consequences, or merely correlates of the disorder.

2. Specificity: Striatal involvement is not unique to ADHD and is seen in other disorders, raising questions about its specific role in ADHD.

3. Developmental changes: The role of the striatum may change over the lifespan, complicating our understanding of its role in ADHD.

4. Heterogeneity: ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder, and not all individuals with ADHD may show the same striatal differences.

5. Integration with other brain regions: The striatum doesn't function in isolation, and its role in ADHD likely depends on its interactions with other brain regions, particularly the prefrontal cortex.

6. Methodology: Different studies use varied methods and tasks, making direct comparisons challenging.

In summary, there is substantial observational evidence supporting the involvement of the striatum in ADHD, particularly from neuroimaging, genetic, and pharmacological studies. However, much of our understanding still relies on hypotheses about how these observed differences translate into ADHD symptoms.

The strength of evidence could be characterized as moderate to strong for striatal involvement in ADHD, but with significant room for further research to clarify the precise nature and extent of this involvement. The field is moving towards more integrative models that consider the striatum as part of larger brain networks involved in ADHD.
