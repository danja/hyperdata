 Comparing the striatal differences between ADHD and OCD is an interesting topic, as both disorders involve the striatum but in distinct ways. Here's a comparison:

1. Striatal circuits involved:
   - ADHD: Primarily involves the fronto-striatal circuit, especially connections between the prefrontal cortex and dorsal striatum.
   - OCD: Mainly involves the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, with emphasis on the ventral striatum and its connections to the orbitofrontal cortex.

2. Neurotransmitter imbalances:
   - ADHD: Often associated with dopamine deficiency in the striatum.
   - OCD: More related to serotonin imbalance, though dopamine is also involved.

3. Activation patterns:
   - ADHD: Generally shows underactivation of the striatum during tasks requiring attention and inhibition.
   - OCD: Typically shows hyperactivation of the striatum, particularly during symptom provocation or error processing.

4. Reward processing:
   - ADHD: Often exhibits reduced striatal activation in response to rewards, potentially explaining difficulties with motivation and delayed gratification.
   - OCD: May show excessive striatal activation in response to both rewards and punishments, possibly contributing to compulsive behaviors.

5. Cognitive flexibility:
   - ADHD: Striatal underactivation may contribute to difficulties in shifting attention and adapting to new situations.
   - OCD: Overactivation in striatal circuits may lead to rigid thinking and difficulty disengaging from repetitive thoughts or behaviors.

6. Impulsivity vs. Compulsivity:
   - ADHD: Striatal dysfunction is associated with impulsivity and difficulty inhibiting responses.
   - OCD: Striatal overactivity is linked to compulsivity and excessive inhibition.

7. Learning and habit formation:
   - ADHD: May have difficulties forming adaptive habits due to altered striatal function.
   - OCD: Tends to form maladaptive habits more easily, possibly due to overactive striatal circuits.

8. Response to medication:
   - ADHD: Often responds well to stimulants that increase dopamine in the striatum.
   - OCD: Typically treated with SSRIs that modulate serotonin, affecting striatal function indirectly.

9. Structural differences:
   - ADHD: Some studies show reduced striatal volume, particularly in the caudate.
   - OCD: Often exhibits increased striatal volume, especially in the putamen.

10. Developmental trajectories:
    - ADHD: Striatal abnormalities may persist but can change over development, often improving in adulthood.
    - OCD: Striatal dysfunction tends to be more stable over time, though it can be influenced by treatment.

These differences highlight how the same brain structure can be involved in different disorders through distinct mechanisms. In ADHD, the striatum's underactivation contributes to difficulties with attention, motivation, and impulse control. In OCD, striatal overactivation is associated with rigid, repetitive behaviors and thoughts.

It's important to note that while these patterns are generally observed, there's considerable variability among individuals, and some people may even have both ADHD and OCD, complicating the neurobiological picture.
