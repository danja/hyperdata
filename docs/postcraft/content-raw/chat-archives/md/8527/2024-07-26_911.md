 Several stimulant medications used in the treatment of ADHD work by increasing dopamine levels in the striatum and other brain regions. The main types are:

1. Amphetamine-based stimulants:
   - Adderall (mixed amphetamine salts)
   - Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine)
   - Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)

2. Methylphenidate-based stimulants:
   - Ritalin (methylphenidate)
   - Concerta (extended-release methylphenidate)
   - Focalin (dexmethylphenidate)

These medications work through slightly different mechanisms:

Amphetamines:
- Increase the release of dopamine from nerve terminals
- Block the reuptake of dopamine, keeping it in the synaptic cleft longer
- Can also affect other neurotransmitters like norepinephrine

Methylphenidate:
- Primarily works by blocking the reuptake of dopamine
- Also affects norepinephrine reuptake

Both types of stimulants effectively increase dopamine activity in the striatum and other brain regions, which is thought to improve ADHD symptoms by enhancing attention, reducing impulsivity, and regulating hyperactivity.

It's important to note that while these medications are effective for many people with ADHD, they should only be used under medical supervision due to potential side effects and risks of misuse. Additionally, not everyone with ADHD responds to stimulants in the same way, and non-stimulant medications are also available for ADHD treatment.

The exact choice of medication, dosage, and treatment plan should be determined by a healthcare provider based on individual patient factors.
