 There has been significant work on mapping between RDF graph structures and object-oriented programming concepts. This is an important area of research for bridging semantic web technologies with traditional software engineering approaches. Here's a concise overview of some key work in this area:

1. OWL to UML mapping: Research has explored mapping Web Ontology Language (OWL), which is built on RDF, to Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams. This allows translating semantic web ontologies into object-oriented designs.

2. RDF to Object Mapping (ROM) frameworks: Several frameworks have been developed to map RDF data directly to objects in various programming languages. Examples include ActiveRDF for Ruby and RDFAlchemy for Python.

3. Object-Triple Mapping (OTM): Similar to Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), OTM aims to bridge the gap between RDF triples and object-oriented programming constructs.

4. Ontology-based programming: Approaches like Zhi# extend existing object-oriented languages with ontology-aware constructs, allowing direct manipulation of RDF data using familiar OO syntax.

5. RDF Schema to Java mapping: Techniques have been developed to generate Java classes from RDF Schema definitions, preserving the class hierarchy and property relationships.

6. Graph databases with object mappings: Some graph databases that support RDF, like Neo4j, offer object mapping capabilities to translate between graph structures and object-oriented code.

This is a concise overview of the field. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect or provide more detailed examples of these approaches?
