 Within machine learning, several subsystem groups are commonly found:

1. Feature Engineering
2. Model Selection and Training
3. Model Evaluation and Validation
4. Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Model Deployment
6. Model Monitoring and Maintenance

Regarding data governance, it plays a crucial role in the overall data and knowledge processing workflow:

Data governance is responsible for:

1. Ensuring data quality and integrity
2. Managing data access and security
3. Establishing data standards and policies
4. Ensuring regulatory compliance
5. Overseeing data lineage and traceability
6. Coordinating data stewardship

Data governance intersects with machine learning in several important ways:

1. It ensures that the data used for training models is accurate, consistent, and properly labeled.
2. It manages access controls to sensitive data used in ML processes.
3. It helps maintain documentation of model development and deployment for auditing purposes.
4. It oversees the ethical use of data and models, including bias detection and mitigation.
5. It ensures compliance with regulations related to data privacy and algorithmic decision-making.

Would you like me to expand on any specific aspects of these machine learning subsystems or data governance roles?
