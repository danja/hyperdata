 Certainly, we can describe machine learning subsystems in terms of their functional roles rather than their implementation details. This approach focuses on what these subsystems do within the broader context of a machine learning workflow. Here's a role-based description:

1. Knowledge Extraction
   - Role: Identifying and extracting relevant patterns and features from raw data

2. Hypothesis Generation
   - Role: Proposing potential models or algorithms that could explain or predict based on the extracted knowledge

3. Learning and Adaptation
   - Role: Adjusting and refining hypotheses based on observed data and feedback

4. Performance Evaluation
   - Role: Assessing how well the current model performs against defined criteria or objectives

5. Decision Making
   - Role: Applying learned knowledge to make predictions, classifications, or recommendations on new data

6. Uncertainty Quantification
   - Role: Estimating and communicating the confidence levels of predictions or decisions

7. Knowledge Integration
   - Role: Incorporating new learned information into the existing knowledge base

8. Anomaly Detection
   - Role: Identifying patterns or instances that deviate significantly from expected behavior

9. Continuous Improvement
   - Role: Monitoring performance over time and adapting to changes in data distribution or objectives

10. Interpretability and Explanation
    - Role: Providing human-understandable insights into the model's decision-making process

This role-based perspective helps to understand the fundamental functions that machine learning systems perform, regardless of the specific algorithms or technologies used to implement them. It focuses on the "what" and "why" rather than the "how" of machine learning subsystems.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these roles or how they interact within a machine learning system?
