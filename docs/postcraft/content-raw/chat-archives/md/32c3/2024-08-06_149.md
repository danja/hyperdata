 It appears you're trying to build the samplv1 project using CMake, but you've encountered an error related to finding the Qt package. The key issue here is:

```
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:143 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindQt.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has asked
  CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Qt", but CMake did
  not find one.
```

This error suggests that CMake cannot find the Qt library, which is a dependency for this project. To resolve this, you need to ensure that Qt is installed on your system and that CMake can locate it. Here are some steps you can take:

1. Install Qt:
   If you haven't already, install Qt on your Ubuntu system. You can do this using the package manager:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install qt5-default
   ```

2. Set the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH:
   If Qt is installed but CMake can't find it, you might need to set the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH. You can do this when running cmake:

   ```
   cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/qt
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/qt` with the actual path where Qt is installed on your system. It's often something like `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt5`.

3. Install Qt development files:
   Sometimes, you need to install additional Qt development files. Try:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev
   ```

4. Clear the build directory and try again:
   If you've made changes, it's a good idea to clear the build directory before trying again:

   ```
   rm -rf build
   cmake -B build
   ```

If you're still having trouble after trying these steps, you might need to provide more information about your Qt installation and the specific version of samplv1 you're trying to build.

Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?
