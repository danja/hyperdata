 It looks like the build system is now able to find Qt6, but it's missing a specific component: Qt6Svg. This component is needed for SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) support. Here's how you can resolve this issue:

1. Install the Qt6 SVG component:
   On Ubuntu, you can install this component using apt:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install libqt6svg6-dev
   ```

   This package should provide the missing Qt6Svg component.

2. If the above doesn't work, you might need to install the full Qt6 development package:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install qt6-base-dev
   ```

3. After installing the necessary packages, clear your build directory and try the cmake command again:

   ```
   rm -rf build
   cmake -B build
   ```

4. If you're still having issues, you can use the debug options mentioned in the error message to get more information:

   ```
   cmake -B build --debug-find-pkg=Qt6Svg
   ```

   or

   ```
   cmake -B build -DQT_DEBUG_FIND_PACKAGE=ON
   ```

   These options will provide more detailed output about why CMake can't find the Qt6Svg component.

5. Make sure your system is up to date:

   ```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get upgrade
   ```

   Sometimes, package conflicts can occur if your system isn't fully updated.

If you're still encountering issues after trying these steps, it would be helpful to see the full CMake output with the debug options enabled. This could provide more clues about why the Qt6Svg component isn't being found.

Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail?
