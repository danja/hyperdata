 To view files changed in recent git commits, you can use the following git commands:

1. To see changes in the most recent commit:

```
git show --name-only
```

2. To see changes in the last n commits:

```
git log --name-only --oneline -n 5
```

Replace 5 with the number of recent commits you want to check.

3. For a more detailed view including the type of change (added, modified, deleted):

```
git log --name-status --oneline -n 5
```

4. To see a summary of changes across all branches:

```
git whatchanged -n 5
```

5. For a graphical representation in the terminal:

```
git log --graph --oneline --decorate --all -n 5
```

These commands will show you the commit messages along with the files that were changed in each commit.

Q1: Do you need to see the actual content changes or just the file names?
Q2: Are you interested in changes in a specific branch or across all branches?
Q3: Would you like to know how to filter these results to show only certain types of files?
