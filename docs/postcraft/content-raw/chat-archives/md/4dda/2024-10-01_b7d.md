 While there isn't a specific artistic movement called "neodadism," there is a movement known as "Neo-Dada" or "New Dada." This movement emerged in the 1950s and 1960s and was influenced by the earlier Dada movement of the early 20th century.

Neo-Dada built upon the ideas and techniques of the original Dada movement, which was characterized by its rejection of traditional artistic standards, use of unconventional materials, and often absurdist or satirical approach to art. Neo-Dada artists incorporated elements of popular culture, everyday objects, and new technologies into their work, blurring the lines between art and life.

Some key features of Neo-Dada include:

1. Use of found objects and everyday materials
2. Incorporation of chance and randomness in the creative process
3. Emphasis on performance and happenings
4. Exploration of new media and technology
5. Critique of consumer culture and mass media

Notable artists associated with Neo-Dada include Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, and John Cage, among others. The movement had a significant influence on later artistic developments, including Pop Art and Fluxus.
