4. Use flashcards or a spaced repetition app to review between sessions.
5. Watch ASL videos with captions to reinforce learning and see signs in context.

Remember, this is a basic introduction. Consistent practice and gradual expansion of vocabulary will be key to improving your ASL skills. Would you like me to suggest some online resources to supplement this learning plan?
