 Given your ADHD diagnosis and reliance on online resources, here's a strategy for learning ASL that may work well for you:

1. Break it down into small, manageable chunks:
   - Focus on learning a few signs each day rather than trying to absorb too much at once.
   - Start with basic vocabulary like greetings, numbers, and everyday objects.

2. Use visual and interactive resources:
   - Video tutorials are particularly useful for ASL. Websites like ASLPro, SignLanguage101, and HandSpeak offer free video lessons.
   - Apps like ASL App or SignLanguage101 provide interactive lessons you can practice on your phone.

3. Incorporate variety to maintain interest:
   - Alternate between different types of resources (videos, apps, games) to keep learning engaging.
   - Mix up the types of signs you're learning (nouns, verbs, phrases) to avoid monotony.

4. Set up a routine, but be flexible:
   - Try to practice at consistent times, but don't be too rigid. If you're not feeling focused, it's okay to switch to a different task and come back later.

5. Use spaced repetition:
   - Review signs you've learned at increasing intervals to reinforce your memory.
   - Apps like Anki or Quizlet can help with this.

6. Make it physical and fun:
   - Practice signs while watching TV with captions or during daily activities.
   - Try to sign along with ASL music videos or children's stories on YouTube.

7. Join online communities:
   - Participate in ASL forums or social media groups to connect with others learning ASL.
   - This can provide motivation and opportunities for practice.

8. Use visual aids:
   - Create colorful flashcards or mind maps to help remember signs.
   - Consider using a visual journal to draw or paste images representing the signs you're learning.

9. Set achievable goals:
   - Start with short-term goals like learning 10 new signs a week.
   - Celebrate small victories to maintain motivation.

10. Take advantage of hyperfocus:
    - When you find yourself particularly engaged, use that energy to dive deeper into learning or practice.

Remember, consistency is key, but be patient with yourself. Learning a new language takes time, and it's okay to progress at your own pace.
