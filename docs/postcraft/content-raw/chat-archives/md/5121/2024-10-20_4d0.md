 Certainly! I'll create a Quick Start document that covers everything we've discussed, including the addition of Git to the system. Then I'll provide a bash script to prepare and run the system.

<antThinking>A Quick Start document is an excellent candidate for an artifact. It's substantial, self-contained, and likely to be referenced multiple times. I'll create a new artifact for it using Markdown.</antThinking>

# Quick Start Guide: Sandboxed Linux Environment with Docker

This guide will help you set up a sandboxed Linux environment using Docker, which includes Node.js, Nginx, Git, and persistent storage capabilities.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your Ubuntu system:

1. Docker
2. Docker Compose
3. Git

If not already installed, you can install them using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose git
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

Note: After adding yourself to the docker group, you may need to log out and back in for the changes to take effect.

## Setup Steps

1. Create a new directory for your project:
   ```
   mkdir my_sandbox && cd my_sandbox
   ```

2. Create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:
   [Content of the Dockerfile artifact]

3. Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:
   [Content of the docker-compose.yml artifact]

4. Create a directory for your application:
   ```
   mkdir app
   ```

5. Create a simple Node.js application in the `app` directory. For example, create `app/app.js`:
   ```javascript
   const http = require('http');
   const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
     res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
     res.end('Hello, Sandboxed World!');
   });
   server.listen(8080, () => console.log('Server running on port 8080'));
   ```

6. Create a basic Nginx configuration. Create `nginx.conf` in your project root:
   ```nginx
   events {
     worker_connections 1024;
   }
   http {
     server {
       listen 80;
       location / {
         proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Running the System

Use the provided bash script (described in the next section) to prepare and run the system. The script will:

1. Build the Docker image
2. Start the containers
3. Display the logs

## Accessing the System

- The Node.js application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`
- Nginx will proxy requests from `http://localhost:80` to the Node.js application
- To access the container's shell for Git operations or other tasks:
  ```
  docker-compose exec app /bin/sh
  ```

## Persistent Storage

- Application code: `./app` on your host is mounted to `/home/myuser/app` in the container
- Persistent data: Use `/home/myuser/data` in the container to store data that should persist
- Logs: Written to `/var/log/myapp` in the container, accessible in `./logs` on your host

## Using Git

Git is installed in the container. To use it:

1. Access the container shell:
   ```
   docker-compose exec app /bin/sh
   ```
2. Configure Git (first time only):
   ```
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   ```
3. Use Git commands as usual within the `/home/myuser/app` directory

Remember to commit your changes and push to remote repositories as needed.

Now, let's create a bash script to prepare and run the system:

<antThinking>A bash script to prepare and run the system is a good candidate for an artifact. It's substantial, self-contained, and likely to be used multiple times. I'll create a new artifact for it.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="setup-and-run-script" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Setup and Run Script">
#!/bin/bash

# Exit on any error
set -e

# Function to check if Docker is running
check_docker() {
    if ! docker info > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        echo "Docker does not seem to be running, start it first and then re-run this script"
        exit 1
    fi
}

# Check if Docker is installed and running
check_docker

# Create necessary directories
mkdir -p app logs

# Check if app.js exists, if not, create a sample one
if [ ! -f app/app.js ]; then
    echo "Creating a sample app.js..."
    cat > app/app.js << EOL
const http = require('http');
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Hello, Sandboxed World!');
});
server.listen(8080, () => console.log('Server running on port 8080'));
EOL
fi

# Check if nginx.conf exists, if not, create it
if [ ! -f nginx.conf ]; then
    echo "Creating nginx.conf..."
    cat > nginx.conf << EOL
events {
  worker_connections 1024;
}
http {
  server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
    }
  }
}
EOL
fi

# Build and start the Docker containers
echo "Building and starting Docker containers..."
docker-compose up --build -d

# Display the logs
echo "Displaying logs (press Ctrl+C to exit)..."
docker-compose logs -f
</antArtifact>

To use this script:

1. Save it as `setup_and_run.sh` in your project directory.
2. Make it executable:
   ```
   chmod +x setup_and_run.sh
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```
   ./setup_and_run.sh
   ```

This script will:
1. Check if Docker is running
2. Create necessary directories
3. Create a sample `app.js` if it doesn't exist
4. Create a basic `nginx.conf` if it doesn't exist
5. Build and start the Docker containers
6. Display the logs

You can modify the script as needed to fit your specific requirements. Remember to stop the containers when you're done:

```
docker-compose down
```

This setup provides you with a sandboxed Linux environment running Node.js, Nginx, and Git, with persistent storage, all managed through Docker. The Quick Start guide and the bash script should help you get up and running quickly on a standard Ubuntu system.
