# [Lightweight Linux Sandbox for Node and Nginx](https://claude.ai/chat/51211c2f-f005-4298-aa05-73a8c44ef2f3)

I'd like a sandboxed linux machine which will support the following : node and nginx runtimes, the ability to easily add other standard packages, access via one http port for admin terminal operations, other http ports as needed for access to/from external clients/servers to communicate with applications.  The setup needs to be very lightweight and easy to install cross-platform. Ideally I'd like something like the core of Ubuntu, supporting apt. But I suspect this would be very big, demanding too many resources and overkill for my requirements. Do you have any suggestions?
