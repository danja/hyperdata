# [Troubleshooting Packer Application Error](https://claude.ai/chat/194aecc5-c225-4459-a99b-9e044af105bd)

 Let me analyze the error and help fix the packer application. The key issue is this error:

```
TypeError: this.config.whiteboard.push is not a function
```

This indicates that `this.config.whiteboard` is not initialized as an array when CaptureAll tries to use it.

<antThinking>This requires a code update to ensure proper initialization of the whiteboard array. The fix should be in an artifact since it's a complete code file.</antThinking>
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isnâ€™t yet supported on mobile.
```



This updated version ensures the whiteboard is properly initialized as an array. Save this as `src/processors/util/CaptureAll.js`.

Some follow-up questions:

q1: Would you like me to review the packer's pipeline configuration to ensure all components are properly configured?

q2: Should we add error handling for cases where files can't be read or accessed?

q3: Do you want to add filtering rules to exclude certain file types or directories?

q4: Would you like to see the expected file structure that should be generated by the packer?
