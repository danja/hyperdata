 To form a verb from "centesimal" that's comparable to "to tithe," we would use the process of back-formation. This is the same process by which "to tithe" was derived from "tithe."

The verb form would be "to centesimate."

So, just as you might say:
"The church tithes its members" (meaning the church requires members to pay a tenth)

You could say:
"The organization centesimates its members" (meaning the organization requires members to pay a hundredth)

It's worth noting that while "to centesimate" is grammatically correct and follows the logical pattern, it's not a commonly used term. In fact, it would be considered a neologism (a newly coined word) in this context. In practical usage, people would more likely say something like "to charge one percent" or "to impose a one-percent fee."
