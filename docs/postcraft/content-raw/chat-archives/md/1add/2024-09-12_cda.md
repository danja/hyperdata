 Paying a hundredth (1/100 or 1%) would be called a "centesimal" if we were to follow a similar naming convention as "tithe."

The word "tithe" comes from an Old English word meaning "tenth." While "centesimal" isn't commonly used in religious or financial contexts like "tithe" is, it's the mathematically correct term for a hundredth part.

In practical usage, a payment of 1% might simply be referred to as "one percent" or a "percentage" rather than having a specific term like tithe.
