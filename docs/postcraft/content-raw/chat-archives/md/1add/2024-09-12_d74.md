 For a thousandth (1/1000 or 0.1%), we can follow the same pattern:

1. The noun form would be "millesimal," which means "consisting of thousandths" or "a thousandth part."

2. The verb form, following the same back-formation process, would be "to millesimate."

So you could theoretically say:
"The organization millesimates its members" (meaning the organization requires members to pay a thousandth or 0.1%)

Again, it's important to note that while "millesimal" is a real mathematical term, its use as a verb in this context would be extremely rare and likely considered a neologism. In practical usage, people would typically say something like "to charge one-tenth of a percent" or "to impose a 0.1% fee."

This follows the pattern we've established:

- Tenth (10%) = tithe / to tithe
- Hundredth (1%) = centesimal / to centesimate
- Thousandth (0.1%) = millesimal / to millesimate

These terms become progressively more obscure and less likely to be used in everyday language as the fractions get smaller.
