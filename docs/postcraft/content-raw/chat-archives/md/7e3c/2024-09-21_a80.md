 As of my last update in April 2024, Pulsar-edit is not officially designed to run on Android devices. Here's a breakdown of the situation:

1. Desktop Focus: Pulsar-edit, like its predecessor Atom, is primarily designed as a desktop application. It's built using Electron, which is a framework for creating native applications with web technologies, typically targeting desktop operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

2. Mobile Limitations: Electron applications don't natively run on Android. The architecture and runtime environment of Android are significantly different from desktop operating systems.

3. No Official Mobile Version: There hasn't been an official initiative from the Pulsar-edit team to create an Android version of the editor.

4. Alternative Approaches: While you can't run Pulsar-edit directly on Android, there are a few potential workarounds if you're looking for a similar experience on a mobile device:

   - Use a remote desktop application to access a computer running Pulsar-edit.
   - Consider using Android-compatible text editors that offer similar features, like code highlighting and plugin systems. Examples include DroidEdit or QuickEdit.
   - For web development, you might look into browser-based IDEs that can run on Android, such as CodeSandbox or StackBlitz.

5. Future Possibilities: As mobile devices become more powerful, we might see more desktop-class applications being ported to mobile platforms. However, as of now, there's no announced plan for an Android version of Pulsar-edit.

If you're specifically looking for coding or text editing solutions on Android, I'd be happy to suggest some alternatives that might meet your needs. What kind of editing or development work are you planning to do on your Android device?
