 I'll create test specs for each provider that include both unit and integration tests.
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



Let me continue with the other providers. Here's Mistral:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



Let me continue with Ollama, which has some unique characteristics since it's local:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



Would you like me to continue with the remaining providers (Groq, Perplexity, and HuggingFace)? Each will follow a similar pattern but with their own specific characteristics and error cases.

Q1: Should I continue with the remaining providers?
Q2: Would you like to see test setup for handling rate limits and retries?
Q3: Should I show how to test model-specific functionality?
Q4: Would you like to see tests for error handling edge cases?
