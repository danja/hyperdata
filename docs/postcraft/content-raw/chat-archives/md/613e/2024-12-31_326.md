 Let me analyze this systematically.

<antThinking>The documentation and code suggest a system integrating LLM capabilities with semantic data storage, requiring a comprehensive architectural diagram. This is a good candidate for artifacts as it's both analytical and visual content that will be referenced.</antThinking>

The architecture diagram and description are consistent with the codebase. The diagram shows the major components and their interactions, while the description accurately reflects the current implementation state.

Q1: Would integrating semantic reasoning capabilities require significant architectural changes?  
Q2: How would distributed storage affect the current memory management system?  
Q3: What visualization components would be most valuable to implement first?  
Q4: How could the system handle multiple simultaneous LLM interactions efficiently?
