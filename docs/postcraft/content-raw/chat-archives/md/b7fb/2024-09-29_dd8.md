 Yes, that's promising! If inxi is reporting your kernel as aarch64, that means your device is using an ARM64 architecture. This is indeed compatible with Ollama's ARM64 install.

ARM64 and aarch64 are essentially two names for the same thing:
- ARM64 is the more common marketing term
- aarch64 is the architecture name used by Linux

Since Ollama provides an ARM64 install, it should theoretically be compatible with your device. However, there might still be some challenges due to the Android/Termux environment differing from a standard Linux distribution.

Here's what you could try:

1. Download the ARM64 version:
   Instead of using the install script, try downloading the ARM64 binary directly. You can do this with:

   ```
   curl -L https://ollama.com/download/ollama-linux-arm64 -o ollama
   ```

2. Make it executable:
   ```
   chmod +x ollama
   ```

3. Try running it:
   ```
   ./ollama
   ```

If this doesn't work directly, you might need to set up a more Linux-like environment within Termux. You could try:

1. Install proot-distro:
   ```
   pkg install proot-distro
   ```

2. Install a Linux distribution, like Ubuntu:
   ```
   proot-distro install ubuntu
   ```

3. Log into the Ubuntu environment:
   ```
   proot-distro login ubuntu
   ```

4. Then try the Ollama ARM64 installation steps within this environment.

Remember that even if you get Ollama installed, running large language models on a mobile device can be very resource-intensive and may not perform well. Also, be aware of your device's storage and memory limitations.

If you encounter specific errors during this process, please share them, and I can provide more targeted assistance.
