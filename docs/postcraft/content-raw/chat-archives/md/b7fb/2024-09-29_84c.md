 Based on the error messages you're seeing, it appears that the installation script is not being executed correctly on your Termux environment. This is likely due to compatibility issues between the Linux-based installation script and the Android/Termux environment. Let's break down the problem and explore some potential solutions:

1. Termux Limitations:
   Termux is a terminal emulator for Android and doesn't provide a full Linux environment. Many Linux commands and system calls may not work as expected.

2. Root Access:
   The script is trying to use `sudo`, which is not available in Termux by default.

3. Architecture Differences:
   The script is designed for x86_64 or arm64 Linux systems, but your Android device might have a different architecture.

4. Missing Dependencies:
   Some required tools or commands might not be available in your Termux installation.

Given these limitations, here are some suggestions:

1. Manual Installation:
   Instead of using the installation script, you might need to manually download and install Ollama binaries compatible with your Android device's architecture.

2. Use a Linux Container:
   You could try running a Linux container within Termux using something like proot-distro, which might provide a more Linux-like environment.

3. Alternative Installation Method:
   Look for Ollama builds specifically designed for Android or Termux, if available.

4. Build from Source:
   If Ollama's source code is available, you might be able to compile it directly on your device, though this could be complex.

5. Use a Different Device:
   Consider using a regular Linux system or a virtual machine if possible, as Ollama might not be fully supported on Android/Termux.

To proceed, I'd recommend:

1. Check if there's an Ollama version specifically for Android or Termux.
2. If not, consider using proot-distro to set up a Linux environment within Termux, then try the installation there.
3. If you're comfortable with compiling software, look into building Ollama from source on your device.

Remember that running AI models like those used by Ollama can be resource-intensive, so performance on a mobile device might be limited even if you get it installed.
