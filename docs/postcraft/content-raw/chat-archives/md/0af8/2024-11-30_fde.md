 I've analyzed the standards and broken down their key aspects. Here's a concise description of each:

DC (Dublin Core): Fundamental metadata element set for digital and physical resources. Provides 15 core elements for describing resources including creator, date, and subject.

DCAT (Data Catalog Vocabulary): RDF vocabulary designed to facilitate interoperability between data catalogs on the web. Enables description of datasets and data services.

PROV-O (Provenance Ontology): W3C standard for representing and exchanging provenance information about data, systems and processes. Models entities, activities and agents.

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources): Healthcare data exchange standard from HL7. Provides modular components called "resources" for clinical and administrative data.

FIBO (Financial Industry Business Ontology): Family of ontologies defining financial industry business concepts and relationships. Focuses on financial instruments, business entities and processes.

XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform): Adobe's standard for embedding metadata in files. Uses RDF to represent properties about documents and assets across multiple formats.

q1: How do these standards complement each other in real-world applications?
q2: What are the main challenges in mapping between these different standards?
q3: Which of these has the strongest semantic expressivity?
q4: How well do these standards support multilingual metadata?
