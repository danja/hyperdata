 Based on available information, ComfyUI workflows are represented as JSON data structures describing a directed graph of nodes and connections. Each node has inputs, outputs, and configuration parameters.

Key structure:
```javascript
{
  "nodes": {
    "id": {
      "class_type": "NodeType",
      "inputs": {},  // input slot values
      "outputs": [], // output slot types
      "_meta": {}    // position, etc
    }
  },
  "connections": [
    ["sourceNode.outputIndex", "targetNode.inputName"]
  ]
}
```

q1: Are you looking to implement a similar workflow format in transmissions?

q2: Would you like to examine how transmissions' RDF format compares?

q3: Are you interested in the runtime execution aspects of ComfyUI workflows?

q4: Should we look at how ComfyUI handles workflow validation and error states?
