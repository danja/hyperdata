 ComfyUI executes workflows using a dependency-based execution model:

1. Each node tracks input dependencies 
2. Nodes only execute when all inputs are available
3. Results flow through graph via message passing
4. Execution is asynchronous with Promise-based coordination
5. GPU operations are queued and managed separately
6. Caching system maintains intermediate results

Key difference from transmissions: ComfyUI focuses on parallel execution optimized for GPU operations, while transmissions uses a more sequential pipeline model.

q1: Would you like to see how ComfyUI's execution coordinator works?

q2: Are you interested in how it handles backpressure and resource management?

q3: Should we examine how it differs from transmissions' EventEmitter pattern?

q4: Would you like to explore adding parallel execution to transmissions?
