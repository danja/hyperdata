 I aim to be direct: I have knowledge cutoff limitations and can't make definitive claims about ComfyUI's current state. However, I understand it is a node-based interface for stable diffusion image generation workflows, similar conceptually to applications we can see in the transmissions codebase.

From the provided context, I see that transmissions uses similar concepts like pipelines and modular processors.

q1: Would you like to explore specific parallels between ComfyUI's node system and transmissions' processor architecture?

q2: Are you planning to integrate image generation capabilities into transmissions?

q3: What specific aspects of ComfyUI's functionality are you interested in understanding better?

q4: Would you like to examine how transmissions' pipeline patterns could be adapted for image processing workflows?
