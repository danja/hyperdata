 I'll analyze how to create a focused repopack configuration based on ComfyUI's core workflow handling and execution model.

Key areas needed for integration:
1. Workflow graph representation
2. Execution model
3. Node message passing
4. Resource management

Suggested repopack.config.json:
```json
{
  "include": [
    "comfy_execution/graph.py",
    "comfy_execution/graph_utils.py", 
    "comfy_execution/caching.py",
    "execution.py",
    "nodes.py",
    "node_helpers.py",
    "custom_nodes/example_node.py.example",
    "server.py",
    "script_examples/basic_api_example.py",
    "comfy/comfy_types.py"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "**/*.pyc",
    "**/__pycache__",
    "**/*.so"
  ],
  "removeComments": true,
  "compactNewlines": true
}
```

q1: Would you like reasoning for each included file?

q2: Should we include any model management code?

q3: Would test files help understand the execution flow?

q4: Should we include web interface code to understand workflow serialization?
