 If we're envisioning a chimpanzee plumber being involved in some kind of construction project, here are some potentially amusing names that could work:

1. Pipe Ape
2. Wrench Chimp
3. Plumb-Bot
4. Simian Plumber
5. Monkey Wrench
6. Primate Pipelayer
7. Chimp Clogbuster
8. Ape Drainlayer
9. Simian Sinksmith
10. Plumb-Primate

These names play on the chimpanzee/ape theme while incorporating plumbing/construction terms like pipe, wrench, plumb, drain, sink, etc. Some add a bit of irreverent humor with words like "bot", "buster", and combining primate terms with human occupations.

A few examples of how they could be used:

"Better call Pipe Ape, he's the best chimp plumber in town!"
"Those Wrench Chimps really knew how to run the pipes for this new building."
"Who unclogged that drain? Must've been the work of Chimp Clogbuster!"

The silly juxtaposition of a chimpanzee working as a plumber or construction worker allows for creative and amusing name possibilities. Of course, the appropriateness would depend on the specific context and audience. But they could inject some whimsy into a construction/plumbing project name.
