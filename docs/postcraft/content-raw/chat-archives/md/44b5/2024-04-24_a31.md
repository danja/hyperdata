 If these connected processing nodes in a graph structure were part of an application or project involving a chimpanzee plumber/constructor, here are some amusing names the chimp might use:

1. Banana Bunches
2. Vine Links
3. Chimp Chains
4. Primate Pipelines 
5. Monkey Branches
6. Ape Vines (as you suggested)
7. Simian Sequences
8. Groovy Graphs
9. Jungle Junctions
10. Treetop Threads

The idea here is to use primate/jungle/forest themes combined with words relating to connected nodes, links, branches, sequences, etc.

Some example usages:

"Make sure to optimize those Banana Bunches for maximum throughput."
"The new Vine Links feature allows dynamic re-routing of the processing flow."
"We'll need a few more Chimp Chains to handle the increased data volume."
"Check out the new visualization tools for mapping Primate Pipelines."

By leaning into the chimpanzee/jungle motif, it allows for creative, on-theme naming of the conceptual pieces. Ape Vines has a nice ring to it for connected nodes/graphs. Or Jungle Junctions could work well for intersections in the processing network.

The whimsical names add a fun, light-hearted touch to otherwise dry technical concepts. As long as the context is appropriate, it could inject some enjoyment into discussing architecture diagrams and process flows.
