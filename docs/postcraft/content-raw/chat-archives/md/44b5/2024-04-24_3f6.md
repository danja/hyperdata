 If the project "Duct Ape" is referring to a configuration of processes joined together in a flow network, and you're looking for alternatives to the word "pipeline", here are some potential options:

1. Workflow
2. Process Chain
3. Flow Network (as you mentioned)
4. Process Sequence
5. Execution Chain
6. Task Pipeline
7. Operation Flow
8. Process Stream
9. Step Sequence
10. Action Chain

Some of these alternatives capture the idea of a series of interconnected processes or steps, while others emphasize the flow or stream-like nature of the configuration.

A few examples of how these could be used:

- "Duct Ape allows you to define and manage complex workflows."
- "Configure your process chain within the Duct Ape interface."
- "Visualize the flow network of your data processing tasks."
- "The execution chain can be monitored and debugged within Duct Ape."
- "Build robust operation flows for your ETL pipelines."

The choice may depend on whether you want to emphasize the sequential aspect, the interconnected nature, or the flow-like quality of the processes. Additionally, some terms like "workflow" or "process chain" are more commonly used in certain domains or industries.
