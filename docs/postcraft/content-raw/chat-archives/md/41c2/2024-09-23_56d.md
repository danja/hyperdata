 Accessing the list of tabs programmatically on an Android device is not straightforward due to security and privacy restrictions. However, there are a few potential approaches you could consider, though they come with limitations:

1. Chrome Debug Bridge:
   Chrome provides a remote debugging protocol that can be used to interact with the browser programmatically. However, this is primarily intended for development purposes and requires a computer connected to the Android device.

2. Android Accessibility Services:
   You could potentially create an Android app that uses Accessibility Services to read the content of the screen, including tab information. This approach is complex and requires careful implementation to comply with Google's policies.

3. Android Debug Bridge (ADB):
   Using ADB, you might be able to extract some information about running apps, including Chrome. This requires the device to be in developer mode and connected to a computer.

4. Chrome Extensions:
   On desktop Chrome, extensions can access tab information. However, Chrome for Android doesn't support extensions, so this isn't directly applicable.

5. Chrome Sync API:
   If the tabs are synced across devices, you might be able to access them through Chrome's sync API on a desktop device. This wouldn't directly access the tabs on the Android device but could provide a list of synced tabs.

6. Custom Browser:
   Creating a custom browser based on Chromium could allow you to access tab information, but this is a significant undertaking.

It's important to note that direct programmatic access to browser data on Android is intentionally limited for security reasons. Any solution would likely require either root access to the device or development of a custom application.

If you're considering developing a solution, you might want to look into creating an Android app that uses Android's Accessibility Services. This could potentially allow you to "read" the tab information from the Chrome interface, although it would require the user to explicitly grant accessibility permissions.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or discuss potential limitations and considerations for implementing them?
