 I have analyzed the question, identified key concepts and components, and broken down the problem into tasks.

Task summaries:
1. Implemented Conditional processor class
2. Created FlowProcessorsFactory for Conditional
3. Defined Conditional in transmissions.ttl
4. Created processors-config.ttl for Conditional
5. Developed simple runner for Conditional

Solution description:
A Conditional processor module was implemented to evaluate conditions and emit messages based on the results. The module supports boolean and match condition types, with extensibility for future types. Configuration files and a simple runner were created to demonstrate its usage within the Transmissions framework.

q1: How can we extend the Conditional processor to support more condition types?
q2: What strategies can be used to optimize the condition evaluation process?
q3: How might we implement error handling for invalid condition configurations?
q4: Can you suggest ways to make the Conditional processor more flexible in terms of output options?
