Can you please suggest words, terms and phrases that might help discuss the following. Ideally the vocabulary should be such that it could later be defined formally as an RDF/OWL ontology. The context is AI agents and the concepts revolve around the notion of attention in the human sense, to apply to knowledge used in project managrment. Attention would be the ideal word at the heart of this, but this also has a technical meaning in the transformer architecture that may lead to confusion. 
To use a geo analogy that doesn't work very well, global knowledge would correspond the surface of the earth. A given project might correspond to a nation state, but projects overlap... An agent, human or software, while working on projects will move around this space,  along with their collaborators. The agents will be provided with rich data that describes them, like very extensive passport and travel documents. This will be a factor in pattern-matchinf between agent, project, requirements and the knowledge landscape. The current scope or region of interest for each agent will change according to their activity within the project. The practical goal of all this is to develop intelligent software that can automatically ensure that the agents have all the knowledge they need is close at hand. The knowledgebase will be expressed as an RDF graph with some kind of ontological structural overlay, together with vector similarity measures. Some parallel to the search PageRank algorithm is required within this notion of attention, but somehow very flexible, relevance will be dynamic, the temporal aspect is very significant.
So please can you review and think creatively about this. I believe pinning down a vocabulary is a good starting point, what do you think? For explaining the notions, the geo analogy is clunky, do you have any suggestions for something better? At this point we are brainstorming, we can explore ideas you think might work further.
