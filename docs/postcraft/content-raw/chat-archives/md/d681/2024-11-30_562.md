I would like an RDF/OWL ontology that can describe filesystem files and directories, which includes an abstraction layer that could also cover resources accessed over http or through sparql queries.
The immediate use case is to store source code in alternative ways to a regular filesystem. A library will be used to carry out typical source code file operations : access, execute, modify, move etc. But the files may be accessed either through standard fs, or over http, via sparql queries or even xmpp messaging.
Three aspects should be covered : modeling of the entities (resources, files etc) and their metadata (file/media type, permissions, provenance), modeling of containers (filesystem trees, graphs including hypertext links), modeling of access protocols (the access methods).
The top, most abstract, layer of the model should primarily be derived from http and rdf concepts and definitions. A secondary layer will cover specific cases : fs, http, sparql, xmpp.   
Keep the ontology simple, but allow for future extension. Right now a piece of instance data should provide enough to give to a text editor so it could create a tree dir navigator and work with the individual files.
 
First please provide a conceptual description of how you'd suggest doing this, as an artifact, as well as a class diagram artifact.
