 While I need to be upfront that I may not be entirely accurate about your previous blog as it's quite specific, I'd be happy to help with Italian wordplay for your new project! 

Let's think about Italian words that could create similar layers of meaning like your clever "rawer/roar" play. In Italian, we could consider:

1. "CRUDO" (meaning "raw") could be interesting base to work from
2. "GRIDO" (meaning "shout/cry") has some sonic similarity to "crudo"

One possibility would be "CRUDORE" - which feels like it could be a word (following Italian formation patterns) but isn't standard Italian. It combines:
- "crudo" (raw)
- "-ore" (a suffix often used for intensity/state)
- Sounds similar to "ruggire" (to roar)

Alternative approach: "GRIDUDO" - a playful combination of:
- "grido" (shout)
- "crudo" (raw)
- Sounds somewhat like "greedy" in English

Would either of these directions interest you? I can explore other options working with different Italian roots or sounds that might capture the multilayered wordplay you're looking for.
