 Since this is a very specific term that might appear rarely, I should note that while I'll try to be accurate, you should double-check any claims about its usage.

"Crudore" seems to be very uncommon - which could actually be advantageous for your purposes. It has that authentic Italian linguistic construction feel (like "calore," "furore," "rigore") but isn't a standard dictionary word. This rarity makes it more "raw" in itself, which adds another nice layer to your wordplay.

The closest common Italian words would be:
- "crudezza" (rawness)
- "crudit√°" (crudity/rawness)

What makes "crudore" particularly interesting is that while it follows Italian word formation rules perfectly (base word + standard suffix), its uncommonness makes it feel both familiar and strange at once - much like your English "rawer." It also has that nice resonance with "ruggire" (to roar) that you were looking for.

Would you like to explore how you might use it in different contexts, or shall we look at some other possibilities?
