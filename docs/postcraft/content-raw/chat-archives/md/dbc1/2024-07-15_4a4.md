 You might be thinking of the `parallel` command. It's not a direct CPU core allocation tool like `taskset`, but it's commonly used to distribute tasks across multiple CPU cores. Here's a brief explanation:

```markdown
### parallel
Description: Executes jobs in parallel using multiple CPU cores.
Example:
`parallel -j 8 my_script.sh ::: input1 input2 input3 input4`
This runs `my_script.sh` on 8 CPU cores simultaneously, processing different inputs.
```

The `-j 8` option tells `parallel` to run 8 jobs at once, effectively utilizing 8 CPU cores.

Alternatively, you might have used `nproc` in combination with other commands to determine the number of available cores:

```markdown
### nproc
Description: Print the number of processing units available.
Example:
`nproc`
This prints the number of available cores, which can be used in scripts to dynamically allocate tasks.
```

If neither of these is what you're remembering, could you provide any more details about how you used the command or what it did? That might help me identify the specific tool you're thinking of.
