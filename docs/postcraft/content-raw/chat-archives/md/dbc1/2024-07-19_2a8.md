 To find out what display server your current session is using, you can try the following methods:

1. Check the WAYLAND_DISPLAY environment variable:
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```
   echo $WAYLAND_DISPLAY
   ```
   If this returns a value (like "wayland-0"), you're using Wayland. If it returns nothing, you're likely using X11.

2. Check for the presence of the DISPLAY environment variable:
   Run:
   ```
   echo $DISPLAY
   ```
   If this returns a value (like ":0"), you're using X11.

3. Use the loginctl command:
   Run:
   ```
   loginctl show-session $(loginctl | grep $(whoami) | awk '{print $1}') -p Type
   ```
   This will show "Type=x11" or "Type=wayland"

4. Check your graphics server:
   Run:
   ```
   echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE
   ```
   This should return either "x11" or "wayland"

5. For GNOME users:
   If you're using GNOME, you can also check with:
   ```
   gnome-shell --version
   ```
   If it runs, you're in an X11 session. If it fails with a message about Wayland, you're in a Wayland session.

6. Use the xrandr command:
   Try running:
   ```
   xrandr --version
   ```
   If it works, you're likely in an X11 session. If it fails with "Can't open display", you're probably in a Wayland session.

Try these methods and see which one gives you a clear answer. This will help you determine whether you're using X11 or Wayland, which can be useful for troubleshooting application issues like the one you're experiencing with Kdenlive.
