 Thank you for providing that information. It appears you are already on Ubuntu 23.10 (Mantic Minotaur), which is the latest non-LTS release as of my last update in April 2024. This explains why you're encountering issues with `do-release-upgrade`.

Here's what you need to know:

1. Ubuntu 23.10 is a non-LTS (Long Term Support) release, supported for 9 months from its release date.

2. The next LTS release after 23.10 would be Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, which should be released in April 2024.

3. `do-release-upgrade` typically doesn't allow upgrades to development versions, which is why you're seeing the error message.

Given this information, here are your options:

1. Wait for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS:
   - Once 24.04 LTS is officially released, you should be able to upgrade normally using `do-release-upgrade`.

2. Keep your current system updated:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

3. If you really need to upgrade to the development version (not recommended for production systems), you can force it with:
   ```
   sudo do-release-upgrade -d
   ```
   However, be aware that this will upgrade you to a potentially unstable development version.

4. If you prefer stability, you could consider doing a fresh install of the latest LTS version (22.04 LTS) and then upgrade to 24.04 LTS when it's released.

Remember, it's generally advisable to stick with LTS versions for better stability and longer support periods, especially for production environments. Non-LTS versions like 23.10 are more suitable for users who want the latest features and are comfortable with more frequent upgrades.
