 I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. You're right, and I thank you for the correction. Since it's July 2024 and Ubuntu 24.04 LTS has been released, here's how you can upgrade to it:

1. First, ensure your current system is up to date:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

2. Make sure the upgrade tool is installed:
   ```
   sudo apt install update-manager-core
   ```

3. Edit the release upgrader configuration:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades
   ```
   Ensure the "Prompt" line is set to:
   ```
   Prompt=lts
   ```

4. Now, run the upgrade command:
   ```
   sudo do-release-upgrade
   ```

This should start the upgrade process to Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. The system will guide you through the upgrade, which may take some time depending on your internet speed and system specifications.

If for some reason this doesn't work, you can try forcing the upgrade:

```
sudo do-release-upgrade -d
```

Remember to back up your important data before starting the upgrade process. Also, ensure you have a stable internet connection and enough free disk space for the upgrade.

If you encounter any specific errors during this process, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist further.
