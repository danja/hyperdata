 I understand. This error message suggests that you're trying to upgrade from an unsupported version directly to the development release, which isn't allowed. Let's try a different approach:

1. First, let's check your current Ubuntu version again:
   ```
   lsb_release -a
   ```
   Please share the output of this command.

2. Now, let's try to upgrade to the next available LTS version. Edit the `/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades` file:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades
   ```
   Make sure the "Prompt" line is set to:
   ```
   Prompt=lts
   ```

3. Update your package lists:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   ```

4. Upgrade all packages:
   ```
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

5. Perform any pending distribution upgrades:
   ```
   sudo apt dist-upgrade
   ```

6. Now try the release upgrade again:
   ```
   sudo do-release-upgrade
   ```

If this doesn't work, we might need to take a more manual approach:

7. Manually update your sources list. First, backup your current sources:
   ```
   sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.bak
   ```

8. Then edit the sources list:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
   ```
   Replace all instances of your current Ubuntu version codename with the codename of the next LTS version. For example, if you're on 16.04 (xenial), replace all instances of "xenial" with "bionic" (18.04 LTS).

9. Update and upgrade:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   sudo apt dist-upgrade
   ```

10. Finally, try the release upgrade again:
    ```
    sudo do-release-upgrade
    ```

If none of these steps work, you may need to consider a fresh install of the latest LTS version. Before doing so, make sure to backup all your important data.

Can you please provide the output of `lsb_release -a` so I can give more specific advice?
