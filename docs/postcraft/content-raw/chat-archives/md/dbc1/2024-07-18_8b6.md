 The image you've shared shows the Ubuntu file manager icon (Nautilus) in the toolbar with a small "3" badge on it.

1. The significance of the "3":
   This number indicates that there are 3 file manager windows or tabs currently open. It's a quick visual cue to show how many instances of the file manager are active without having to switch to them.

2. Regarding the missing "New Window" option:
   The absence of a "New Window" option in the right-click menu is unusual. Typically, this option should be available. Here are a few things you can try:

   a. Use keyboard shortcut:
      - Press Ctrl+N when a file manager window is active to open a new window.

   b. Check if the option is available in the top menu:
      - Open a file manager window
      - Look for "File" in the top menu bar (you might need to move your mouse to the top of the screen)
      - Check if "New Window" is listed there

   c. Reinstall Nautilus:
      - Open a terminal
      - Run: `sudo apt install --reinstall nautilus`

   d. Reset Nautilus configuration:
      - Close all file manager windows
      - Open a terminal
      - Run: `dconf reset -f /org/gnome/nautilus/`
      - Restart Nautilus: `nautilus -q` then reopen it

If these steps don't resolve the issue, it might be worth checking if your Ubuntu installation has any customizations or if there are any system updates available that might address this.
