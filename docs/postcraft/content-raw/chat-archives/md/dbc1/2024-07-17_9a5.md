 I apologize for the confusion. It seems that Ubuntu 23.10 has reached its end of life, which is why you're seeing this message. In this case, we need to take a different approach. Here's what you can do:

1. First, make sure your system is fully updated:

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   ```

2. If that doesn't work due to repository issues, you may need to update your sources. Create a backup of your current sources list:

   ```
   sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
   ```

3. Then, update your sources list to use the old-releases repository:

   ```
   sudo sed -i -re 's/([a-z]{2}\.)?archive.ubuntu.com|security.ubuntu.com/old-releases.ubuntu.com/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
   ```

4. Update your package lists:

   ```
   sudo apt update
   ```

5. Now try the upgrade again:

   ```
   sudo do-release-upgrade
   ```

If this still doesn't work, you might need to manually edit your sources list to point to the next LTS version (24.04). Here's how:

6. Edit your sources list:

   ```
   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
   ```

7. Replace all instances of "mantic" with "noble" (the codename for 24.04).

8. Save the file and exit.

9. Update and upgrade:

   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   sudo apt dist-upgrade
   ```

10. Finally, try the release upgrade again:

    ```
    sudo do-release-upgrade
    ```

If none of these steps work, you may need to consider a fresh install of Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Remember to backup all your important data before attempting any major system changes.

If you encounter any specific errors during this process, please share them, and I'll provide more targeted assistance.
