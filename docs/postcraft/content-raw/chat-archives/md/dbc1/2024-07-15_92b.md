# Explanation of `ps -o pid,pri,ni,cmd -p 177213`

This command uses the `ps` (process status) utility to display information about a specific process:

- `ps`: The base command to report process status
- `-o pid,pri,ni,cmd`: Specifies the output format
  - `pid`: Process ID
  - `pri`: Priority of the process
  - `ni`: Nice value of the process
  - `cmd`: The command with all its arguments
- `-p 177213`: Selects the process with PID 177213

This command will output a table with four columns:
1. PID (Process ID): The unique identifier for the process
2. PRI (Priority): The current priority of the process
3. NI (Nice Value): The nice value, which affects process scheduling priority
4. CMD (Command): The command that started the process, including its arguments

This is useful for checking the priority and nice value of a specific process, which can be helpful when optimizing system performance or troubleshooting issues related to process scheduling.
