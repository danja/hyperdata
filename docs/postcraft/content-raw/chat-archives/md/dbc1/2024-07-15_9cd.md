# Explanation of `top -p 177213`

This command uses the `top` utility to monitor a specific process:

- `top`: The base command that provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system
- `-p 177213`: Specifies the Process ID (PID) to monitor

When executed, this command will:

1. Launch the `top` program in your terminal
2. Display real-time information about only the process with PID 177213
3. Continuously update this information (typically every 3 seconds by default)

The output will include:

- PID: Process ID (177213 in this case)
- USER: User who owns the process
- PR: Priority of the process
- NI: Nice value of the process
- VIRT: Virtual memory used
- RES: Resident memory used
- SHR: Shared memory used
- S: Process status (e.g., R for running, S for sleeping)
- %CPU: Percentage of CPU used by this process
- %MEM: Percentage of memory used by this process
- TIME+: Total CPU time used by the process
- COMMAND: Command used to start the process

This command is useful for monitoring the resource usage of a specific process in real-time, which can be helpful for performance tuning and troubleshooting.

Note: You can exit the `top` display by pressing 'q'.
