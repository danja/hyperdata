 Certainly! Here's a Python script that will perform the same operations as your Bash script:

```python
import os
import subprocess

def run_command(command):
    try:
        result = subprocess.run(command, check=True, text=True, capture_output=True)
        print(result.stdout)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error executing command: {e}")
        print(f"Error output: {e.stderr}")

def main():
    # Define the path to the rife executable
    rife_path = '/home/danny/foaf-archive-support/rife/rife-ncnn-vulkan-20221029-ubuntu/rife-ncnn-vulkan'

    # Define input and output directories
    input_dir = '../data/upscaled/'
    output_dir = '../data/interpolated/'

    # Construct the command
    command = [rife_path, '-i', input_dir, '-o', output_dir]

    # Run the command
    run_command(command)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This Python script does the following:

1. We define a `run_command` function that uses `subprocess.run` to execute shell commands. It prints the output or any errors that occur.

2. In the `main` function:
   - We define the path to the rife executable.
   - We specify the input and output directories.
   - We construct the command as a list, which is how `subprocess.run` expects it.
   - We call `run_command` to execute the rife command.

3. The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block ensures the `main()` function is called when the script is run directly.

To use this script:

1. Save it as a Python file (e.g., `run_rife.py`).
2. Make sure it has execute permissions: `chmod +x run_rife.py`
3. Run it: `python run_rife.py`

This script will perform the same operation as your Bash script, running the rife command with the specified input and output directories.

Note: This script assumes that the relative paths (`../data/upscaled/` and `../data/interpolated/`) are correct relative to where you're running the script from. If you need to run it from a different directory, you might want to use absolute paths or adjust the working directory in the script.
