# [Troubleshooting Transmission Framework Path Resolution](https://claude.ai/chat/57515c2b-2a75-452b-ac7e-e738037f1b68)

 I have analyzed the path resolution issue in the Transmissions framework.

Task summaries:
1. Traced file path construction through command execution chain
2. Identified incorrect path resolution in ApplicationManager
3. Located missing normalization of external paths
4. Found solution in CommandUtils.run() path handling

Solution:
The ApplicationManager.resolveApplicationPath() method assumes applications are within the src/applications directory, but module-load-test is in an external path. CommandUtils.run() should preserve the full external path when the application path starts with "../".

q1: Should external application paths be handled differently from internal ones in the ApplicationManager?

q2: Would adding a isExternalPath() helper method improve the code organization?

q3: Should the framework validate application paths before attempting to load files?

q4: Could environment variables help manage application paths more flexibly?
