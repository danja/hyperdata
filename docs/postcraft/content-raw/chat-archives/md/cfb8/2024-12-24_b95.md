 The 74HC164 and 74HC165 shift registers can be configured as dividers by connecting their outputs back to their inputs to create a ring counter or Johnson counter configuration. Here's how:

For 74HC164 (Serial-in, Parallel-out):
1. Take any output bit (Q0-Q7)
2. Invert it (using something like a 74HC04 inverter)
3. Feed it back to the serial input (DS)
4. Each clock pulse will shift the pattern, dividing the clock

Example divider ratios:
- Divide by 2: Connect Q7 inverted back to DS
- Divide by 8: Use Q7 directly (no inverter) back to DS
- Other ratios can be achieved by using different output taps

For 74HC165 (Parallel-in, Serial-out):
1. Connect the serial output (Q7) to one of the parallel inputs
2. Other parallel inputs can be tied high/low to create pattern
3. Use LOAD pin to load the pattern
4. Clock signal shifts the pattern around

However, it's worth noting that using shift registers as dividers is not their primary purpose and has some disadvantages:
- Requires additional logic (like inverters)
- Not as straightforward as dedicated counter ICs
- May need careful initialization
- More sensitive to noise/glitches

For frequency division, purpose-built counter ICs like the 74LS90 or 74LS161 would be more reliable and easier to use. Would you like me to explain more about implementing specific division ratios with either of these shift registers?
