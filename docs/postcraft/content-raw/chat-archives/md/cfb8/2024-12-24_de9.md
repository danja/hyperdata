 Ah, my mistake! You're absolutely right - I shouldn't connect multiple outputs together as that would cause a short. Let me correct the design using logic gates to create the proper feedback pattern.

<antThinking>The corrected design needs combinational logic to generate the proper feedback pattern without shorting any outputs. This will be clearer in a new diagram.</antThinking>

In this corrected version:

1. Instead of directly connecting outputs, we use a NAND gate to create the feedback:
   - Q0 and Q2 are inputs to the NAND gate
   - NAND gate output feeds both DSA and DSB inputs (which can be tied together)

2. The NAND gate logic ensures proper pattern generation:
   - Prevents shorts between outputs
   - Creates the correct sequence for divide-by-7 operation
   - Maintains proper logic levels

3. Circuit operation:
   - Pattern will cycle through 7 states
   - Q0 provides the divided output
   - NAND gate creates next input based on current state

This is a much safer design that won't damage the IC. Would you like me to explain the state sequence or timing diagram for this corrected version?
