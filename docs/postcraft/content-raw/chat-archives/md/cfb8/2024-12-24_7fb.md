 I'll create a block diagram showing how to implement a divide-by-7 counter using a 74HC164 shift register.

<antThinking>This diagram would be best represented as an SVG since it's a technical drawing showing IC connections and signal paths. Creating it as a clear, well-labeled block diagram will help visualize the concept.</antThinking>

Key points about this divide-by-7 configuration:

1. Connections:
   - Clock input goes to CLK pin
   - DSA and DSB are tied together (both receive feedback)
   - Q6 output is fed back to DSA/DSB inputs
   - VCC connected to +5V
   - GND connected to ground
   - MR (Master Reset) tied to VCC for normal operation

2. Operation:
   - Creates pattern: 1111000
   - Each clock pulse shifts the pattern one position
   - Complete cycle takes 7 clock pulses
   - Output can be taken from any Q output
   - Q0 provides divided output signal

3. Initialization:
   - Circuit needs proper power-up reset
   - Pattern will establish itself after power-up
   - First few cycles may be irregular until pattern stabilizes

The output frequency will be the input frequency divided by 7, though the duty cycle won't be exactly 50%. Would you like me to explain the timing diagram or any specific part of the circuit in more detail?
