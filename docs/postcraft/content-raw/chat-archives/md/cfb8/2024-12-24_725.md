# [Identifying Binary Divider ICs](https://claude.ai/chat/cfb876d1-aa73-41e7-9097-774c0c2c960d)

 The divide-by-5 function in the 74LS90 works through an internal counter arrangement. Let me break it down:

Inside the 74LS90, there are four flip-flops arranged in a special configuration:
- The first flip-flop can operate independently as a divide-by-2
- The other three flip-flops are connected in a counter arrangement that creates a divide-by-5 sequence

For the divide-by-5 section, the counter goes through these states:
0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0 (repeats)

This is achieved by using feedback logic that forces the counter to reset to 0 after reaching count 4, instead of continuing to counts 5-7 like a normal 3-bit counter would. The feedback logic detects when the count reaches 4 (binary 100) and resets the counter, creating the divide-by-5 sequence.

When configured as a decade counter (divide-by-10), the divide-by-2 and divide-by-5 sections are cascaded:
- First section divides input by 2
- Second section divides that result by 5
- Final result: input frequency รท (2 ร 5) = input frequency รท 10

The IC has control pins that allow you to:
1. Reset the counter to zero
2. Configure whether you want to use it as divide-by-10 or use the sections independently
3. Control when counting is enabled

Would you like me to explain more about the pin connections for specific configurations?
