 Certainly! Here's a verbose and silly way of saying "don't ask stupid questions" with most words beginning and ending with 't':

<antThinking>This request is for a creative, silly phrase, which doesn't qualify as an artifact. It's not substantial content that the user is likely to modify or reuse. It's better presented within our conversation for easy reading and potential follow-up.</antThinking>

"Thoughtless theorist, tempt not the tolerant tutor's temperament! Thy trifling, threadbare thought-tidbits torment. Terminate thine transparent, tepid treasonist twaddle tout!
Transcendent truths thirst thoughtful, transient tenet-tests that twist, tilt, tightrope-traverse twixt taught testament. Trust thine tact, tweak that tawdry turmoil-tainted tact!
Thus, thwart thine twilight-tinted, trivial tittle-tattle tract!"

This verbose version playfully uses alliteration and words beginning and ending with 't' to convey the message. It's deliberately over-the-top and might be paraphrased as:

"Unthinking person, don't test the patient teacher's temper! Your trivial, overused questions are annoying. Stop your obvious, lukewarm, traitorous nonsense immediately! 
Great truths require thoughtful, challenging questions that navigate between established knowledge. Trust your judgment, and improve your tactless, trouble-causing approach! 
Therefore, avoid your dim-witted, unimportant gossip-like inquiries!"

Would you like me to explain any part of this silly construct?
