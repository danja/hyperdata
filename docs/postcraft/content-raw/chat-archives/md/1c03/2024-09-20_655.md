 The latest version of the Android Java API that I'm familiar with based on my knowledge cutoff in April 2024 is Android 14, which corresponds to API level 34.

Android 14 was released in October 2023. It introduced several new features and improvements, including:

1. Enhanced privacy and security features
2. Improved support for large screens and foldable devices
3. New customization options for the lock screen
4. Battery life optimizations
5. Improvements to accessibility features

However, it's important to note that Android development is constantly evolving, and new versions or updates may have been released since my last update. For the most current information, I recommend checking the official Android Developers website or documentation.

When developing for Android, it's generally a good practice to target a recent API level while still maintaining backwards compatibility with older versions to ensure your app can run on a wide range of devices.

Would you like more specific information about any particular aspect of the Android Java API?
