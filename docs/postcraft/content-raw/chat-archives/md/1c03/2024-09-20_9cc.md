 For transferring files from an Android phone to a Linux PC over WiFi using a standard protocol, there are several options available in the Android Java API. Here are some approaches you could consider:

1. HTTP/HTTPS (using a simple web server):

<antThinking>This code example is relatively short and primarily illustrative. It doesn't warrant a separate artifact and fits well within the conversational flow.</antThinking>

```java
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpServer;
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpHandler;
import com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpExchange;

// ... other imports

public class SimpleFileServer {
    public void startServer() throws IOException {
        int port = 8000;
        HttpServer server = HttpServer.create(new InetSocketAddress(port), 0);
        server.createContext("/", new FileHandler());
        server.setExecutor(null);
        server.start();
    }

    class FileHandler implements HttpHandler {
        @Override
        public void handle(HttpExchange exchange) throws IOException {
            // Implement file serving logic here
        }
    }
}
```

This approach uses Java's built-in `HttpServer` to create a simple web server. You'd need to implement the file serving logic in the `FileHandler` class.

2. FTP (using Apache Commons Net library):

While not part of the core Java API, the Apache Commons Net library provides FTP functionality and is widely used in Android development.

3. WebSocket:

Android supports WebSocket communication, which could be used for real-time file transfer.

4. Network Service Discovery (NSD):

```java
NsdManager nsdManager = (NsdManager) getSystemService(Context.NSD_SERVICE);
```

This can be used to advertise your file transfer service on the local network.

5. Wi-Fi Direct:

```java
WifiP2pManager manager = (WifiP2pManager) getSystemService(Context.WIFI_P2P_SERVICE);
```

This allows direct Wi-Fi connections between devices without an access point.

6. Nearby Connections API:

While primarily for short-range communication, it can work over Wi-Fi as well.

For your use case, I would recommend either the HTTP server approach or using a library like Apache Commons Net for FTP. These are standard protocols that would be easy to interact with from a Linux PC.

Here's a basic outline of how you might structure your app:

1. Create a service to run your file server in the background.
2. Implement file selection functionality in your main activity.
3. When a file is selected, start the service and make the file available.
4. Display connection information (IP address and port) to the user.
5. On the Linux PC, you could then use a web browser (for HTTP) or an FTP client to connect and download the file.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches or provide more detailed code examples?
