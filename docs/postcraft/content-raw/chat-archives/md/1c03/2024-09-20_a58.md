 To find information about the physical drives on a Linux system, you can use several commands in the terminal. Here are a few common methods:

1. `lsblk` command:
   This command lists information about all block devices (including physical drives).
   
   ```
   lsblk
   ```

2. `fdisk -l` command:
   This command provides detailed information about disk partitions.
   
   ```
   sudo fdisk -l
   ```

3. `parted -l` command:
   Similar to fdisk, parted can list disk information.
   
   ```
   sudo parted -l
   ```

4. `df -h` command:
   While primarily used to show disk space usage, it can also show mounted drives.
   
   ```
   df -h
   ```

5. `ls /dev/sd*` or `ls /dev/nvme*`:
   These commands list SATA/SCSI and NVMe drives respectively.
   
   ```
   ls /dev/sd*
   ls /dev/nvme*
   ```

The `lsblk` command is often the most straightforward for a quick overview. If you need more detailed information, `fdisk -l` or `parted -l` would be better choices.

Would you like me to explain any of these commands in more detail?
