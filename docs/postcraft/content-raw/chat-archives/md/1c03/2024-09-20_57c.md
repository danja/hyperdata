 Yes, there is! The word you're looking for is:

Terse

"Terse" means brief, concise, or succinct in style or language. It describes communication that uses few words to express an idea clearly and directly.

For example:
- "His terse reply made it clear he was annoyed."
- "The journalist's terse writing style conveyed complex ideas efficiently."

This word fits perfectly with your request for a t...t word meaning something like succinct. It's often used to describe writing or speech that is brief and to the point, without unnecessary elaboration.
