 Certainly! Android provides robust support for HTTP operations, including PUT and POST requests, through its built-in networking libraries. The most commonly used and recommended HTTP client for Android is `HttpURLConnection`, which is part of the standard Java API and supports all HTTP methods including PUT and POST.

For more advanced features and easier use, many developers prefer using third-party libraries like OkHttp or Retrofit. However, let's focus on the built-in solution first.

Here's a basic example of how you can use `HttpURLConnection` to perform a PUT request:

<antThinking>This code example is substantial and self-contained, demonstrating a complete HTTP PUT operation. It's likely that the user might want to modify or reuse this code, making it a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="http-put-example" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="java" title="HTTP PUT Request Example">
import java.io.*;
import java.net.HttpURLConnection;
import java.net.URL;

public class HttpPutExample {
    public static void putFile(String fileUrl, File file) {
        try {
            URL url = new URL(fileUrl);
            HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            connection.setDoOutput(true);
            connection.setRequestMethod("PUT");
            connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/octet-stream");
            connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Length", String.valueOf(file.length()));

            try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream(file);
                 OutputStream os = connection.getOutputStream()) {
                byte[] buffer = new byte[4096];
                int bytesRead;
                while ((bytesRead = fileInputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {
                    os.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
                }
            }

            int responseCode = connection.getResponseCode();
            System.out.println("Response Code: " + responseCode);

            connection.disconnect();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        File file = new File("path/to/your/file");
        putFile("http://your-server-url/upload", file);
    }
}
</antArtifact>

This example demonstrates how to send a file using an HTTP PUT request. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. It establishes a connection to the specified URL.
2. Sets the request method to PUT.
3. Sets appropriate headers, including Content-Type and Content-Length.
4. Reads the file in chunks and writes it to the output stream of the connection.
5. Checks the response code to see if the upload was successful.

For POST requests, the process is very similar. You would just change the `setRequestMethod("PUT")` to `setRequestMethod("POST")`.

If you prefer a more modern and feature-rich approach, you might consider using the OkHttp library. It's more efficient and easier to use for complex networking tasks. Here's how you might use OkHttp for a PUT request:

<antArtifact identifier="okhttp-put-example" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="java" title="OkHttp PUT Request Example">
import okhttp3.*;
import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;

public class OkHttpPutExample {
    private final OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient();

    public void putFile(String url, File file) throws IOException {
        RequestBody requestBody = RequestBody.create(MediaType.parse("application/octet-stream"), file);
        Request request = new Request.Builder()
                .url(url)
                .put(requestBody)
                .build();

        try (Response response = client.newCall(request).execute()) {
            if (!response.isSuccessful()) throw new IOException("Unexpected code " + response);
            System.out.println(response.body().string());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        OkHttpPutExample example = new OkHttpPutExample();
        File file = new File("path/to/your/file");
        example.putFile("http://your-server-url/upload", file);
    }
}
</antArtifact>

To use OkHttp, you'd need to add it to your project dependencies. In your app's `build.gradle` file, you would add:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.10.0'
}
```

Both of these methods will allow you to push files from your Android device to a server. The choice between using the built-in `HttpURLConnection` and a library like OkHttp often comes down to personal preference and specific project requirements.

Would you like me to explain any part of these examples in more detail?
