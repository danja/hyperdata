 Slingshot bands typically come in a range of thicknesses to suit different purposes and preferences. Here are some common thickness ranges:

1. Thin bands: 0.4 mm - 0.6 mm
   - These are often used for target shooting and small game hunting.
   - They offer faster projectile speeds but less power.

2. Medium bands: 0.7 mm - 0.9 mm
   - This is a popular all-purpose range.
   - Good balance of speed and power for various uses.

3. Thick bands: 1.0 mm - 1.5 mm
   - Used for hunting larger game or when more power is needed.
   - They provide more power but slower projectile speeds.

Some key points to note:

- Band thickness affects draw weight, power, and projectile speed.
- Thicker bands generally provide more power but require more effort to draw.
- Thinner bands are easier to draw and provide higher velocities, but with less overall power.
- The optimal thickness can depend on factors like your draw length, the type of ammunition you're using, and your intended use (target practice vs. hunting).
- Many slingshot enthusiasts experiment with different thicknesses to find their preferred setup.

Remember that band material (usually latex or rubber) and width also play crucial roles in slingshot performance, not just thickness. It's common for enthusiasts to adjust all these factors to achieve their desired performance.
