 Ah, I apologize for misunderstanding. You're looking for a word that both begins and ends with 't' and means something like "succinct." Unfortunately, there isn't a common English word that fits those exact criteria and means "succinct" or "brief."

However, here are some t...t words that, while not synonymous with "succinct," are somewhat related to communication or expression:

1. Tacit: Understood without being openly expressed
2. Tract: A short treatise or pamphlet (which could be succinct)
3. Taut: Concise or edited to remove superfluous elements (often used for writing)
4. Test: An examination or trial (which might require succinct answers)

Among these, "taut" is probably the closest in meaning to "succinct," especially when used to describe writing or speech. For example, "Her taut prose conveyed complex ideas efficiently."

If you're looking for a playful or made-up word, you could consider something like "tersest" (the superlative form of "terse"), though this isn't a standard word and the middle doesn't strictly follow the t...t pattern.
