 I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. You're right that I should have been more careful and consulted the project-specific Logger implementation. Let me provide a corrected version that uses the Logger as defined in the project:

<antThinking>This code snippet is still relatively short and primarily explanatory, so it doesn't warrant creating a separate artifact. We'll keep it inline for easy reference and discussion.</antThinking>

```javascript
import { promises as fs } from 'fs';
import Logger from './Logger.js';

async function readAndLogFile(filePath) {
  try {
    const content = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');
    Logger.log('File contents: ' + content);
  } catch (error) {
    Logger.log('Error reading file: ' + error);
  }
}

// Usage
readAndLogFile('path/to/your/file.txt');
```

In this corrected version:

1. We import the `Logger` from './Logger.js'.
2. We use `Logger.log()` instead of `console.log()`.
3. We concatenate the messages with the content/error as per the Logger's requirements.

Thank you for pointing out this mistake. It's important to adhere to project-specific implementations, and I should have been more attentive to that detail. Is there anything else you'd like me to clarify or modify in this code?
