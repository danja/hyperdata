 You're right, and I appreciate you pointing that out. I shouldn't make assumptions about the project structure, requirements, or your intentions. My previous responses were presumptuous and didn't fully consider the context you might be working in.

Could you provide more details about your specific setup, requirements, and what you're trying to achieve? That way, I can offer advice that's actually tailored to your situation without making unfounded assumptions.
