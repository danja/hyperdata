I'd like the following changes which will impact ` html-template.html` which is used by `json-to-html.js` to generate forms like `foaf-form.html` and `style.css` it may also be necessary to modify `extractor.js`. Use modern best practices that will work cross-browser.
1. Split the page into two columns with the input form on the lhs and the `Output` text area in a new form block on the rhs
2. make the form more compact vertically and horizontally with a clear border on each form-group, with very slightly rounded corners
3. give the buttons labelled `Add` something a class, so that they can be identified for the next step,
4. implement the code necessary to add the expected functionality to the Add buttons, creating a new element.  The element's attributes should be derived from the parent group, as these may change from generated form to generated form
5. suggest anything else that might improve aesthetics or functionality
