# Rat Vocalization Recording and Playback System

## System Requirements

### Rat Vocalization Characteristics
- Frequency range: 18-32 kHz (audible) + 38-70 kHz (ultrasonic)
- Duration: 3-65 ms typical
- Amplitude modulation patterns vary by vocalization type

  - Frequency response up to 80 kHz
  - Low self-noise
  - One optimized for audible, one for ultrasonic
- High-speed ADC sampling at minimum 200 kHz
- Anti-aliasing filter before ADC

#### Audio Output
- MA40S4S ultrasonic transducer (40 kHz center frequency)
- Small 8Î© speaker for audible range
- Dual DAC channels
- Output amplification stages

#### Power Supply
- 3.7V LiPo battery
- Battery management IC
- Low-noise voltage regulators
- Expected runtime: 4-6 hours

### Software Architecture

## Estimated Bill of Materials
- ESP32-WROVER Module: $12
- MEMS Microphones (2x): $8
- Ultrasonic Transducer: $5
- Speaker: $3
- Battery + Management: $15
- PCB + Components: $20
- Case: $10
- Total: ~$73

## Initial Testing Protocol
