I'd like you to think about an electronics project. The ultimate goal is human-rat communications. But we will start less ambitious, recording rat vocalizations and generating them. The initial hardware will be a small, portable unit based around an ESP32 module, with a Wifi link to a computer with more processing power. It will have one or more electret microphone elements and cheap 40kHz transducers, maybe a small audio loudspeaker, sipported whatever standard analog circuitry is called for.  Think about the characteristics of rat vocalizations, and give me the outline of a first practical prototype. Make this an artifact.
