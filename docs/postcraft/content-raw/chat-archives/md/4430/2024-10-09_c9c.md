 To diagnose your internet connection issues, you can try the following steps using your Linux computer and router:

1. Check your local network:
   - Ensure all cables are securely connected.
   - Try connecting to your router via Ethernet if possible.
   - Verify that other devices on your network are experiencing the same issue.

2. Monitor your connection:
   - Open a terminal and run a continuous ping to a reliable server:
     ```
     ping -c 1000 8.8.8.8
     ```
   This will send 1000 pings to Google's DNS server. Watch for packet loss and response times.

3. Check your router:
   - Access your router's web interface.
   - Look for signal strength indicators for the radio link.
   - Check for any error messages or logs.
   - Reboot the router if necessary.

4. Use traceroute to identify where the connection fails:
   ```
   traceroute 8.8.8.8
   ```
   This will show the path your connection takes. If it consistently fails at a certain hop, the problem might be there.

5. Monitor your system logs:
   ```
   tail -f /var/log/syslog
   ```
   Look for any recurring error messages related to network interfaces.

6. Check for interference:
   - If possible, try changing the channel or frequency on your radio link.
   - Look for potential sources of interference (new structures, trees, etc.)

7. Contact your ISP:
   - If the problem persists, gather the data from these tests and contact your service provider.
   - They can check their antenna and systems for issues.

Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail?
