 Abstract:

This meta-analysis investigates the controversial "Fluxotonin Human Trials" paper, which has recently been revealed as an elaborate work of fiction. Our study examines how the purported effects of fluxotonin paradoxically led to its own fictional creation. Through interviews with the original authors and analysis of their writing process, we uncovered that the researchers, while exploring theoretical cognitive enhancers, experienced a collective flow state that resulted in the generation of the entirely fictitious fluxotonin concept and study. This phenomenon raises intriguing questions about the nature of creativity, collective cognition, and the power of suggestion in scientific endeavors. Our findings highlight the thin line between imagination and reality in cutting-edge research, and the potential for self-fulfilling hypotheses in the realm of cognitive enhancement studies. This case serves as a cautionary tale about the need for rigorous peer review and replication, especially in fields intersecting neuroscience and psychology.

Q1: How might this revelation impact the credibility of other cognitive enhancement research?
Q2: What psychological mechanisms could explain the researchers' shared delusion of having conducted the fluxotonin study?
Q3: Could the process of creating this elaborate fiction itself provide valuable insights into flow states and collective creativity?
