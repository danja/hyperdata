 Q1: Phlogiston theory posited that combustible materials contained a fire-like element called phlogiston, released during burning. This misunderstanding delayed the discovery of oxygen's role in combustion.

Q2: Key neurochemicals in flow states include dopamine, norepinephrine, endorphins, anandamide, and serotonin. These regulate focus, pleasure, and time perception.

Q3: Fictional scientific terms can spark interest in real science but may also lead to misconceptions if not clearly distinguished from factual concepts.

Expanding on fluxotonin:

Fluxotonin, a fictional hormone, could be described as a neurotransmitter produced in the hypothalamus. It might work by:

1. Enhancing neural plasticity
2. Increasing focus and attention
3. Reducing activity in the default mode network
4. Boosting cognitive flexibility

Hypothetical effects could include improved task engagement, heightened creativity, and reduced self-consciousness.

Q1: How might fluxotonin interact with other known neurotransmitters?
Q2: What potential side effects could result from artificially elevating fluxotonin levels?
Q3: In what fields might the concept of fluxotonin be particularly useful as a plot device or thought experiment?
