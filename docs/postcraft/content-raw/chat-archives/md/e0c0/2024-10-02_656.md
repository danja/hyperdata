 Abstract:

This paper explores the hypothetical hormone fluxotonin and its potential interactions within the human neurochemical system. We propose that fluxotonin may act synergistically with dopamine and norepinephrine to enhance cognitive function, while potentially downregulating serotonin to reduce self-awareness. However, artificial elevation of fluxotonin levels could lead to adverse effects such as addiction, cognitive burnout, and disrupted sleep patterns. The concept of fluxotonin presents intriguing possibilities in fields such as neuroscience fiction, productivity research, and cognitive enhancement ethics, offering a framework to discuss the implications of flow state manipulation in both scientific and societal contexts.

Q1: How does the concept of fluxotonin compare to real hormones involved in cognitive enhancement?
Q2: What ethical considerations would arise if fluxotonin-like substances were developed?
Q3: How might the idea of fluxotonin influence public perception of neuroscience and cognitive research?
