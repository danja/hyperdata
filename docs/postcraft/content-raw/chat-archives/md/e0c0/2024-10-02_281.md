 Oxygen was originally called "dephlogisticated air" in the early days of chemistry.

"Flostroegen" isn't a recognized word, but it's an interesting neologism. A more scientifically-sound term for a fictional hormone inducing flow state could be "fluxotonin" or "rheoendorphin".

Q1: How did the phlogiston theory influence early understanding of combustion and oxidation?
Q2: What are the key neurochemical factors involved in achieving a flow state?
Q3: How do fictional scientific terms in literature impact public understanding of real science?
