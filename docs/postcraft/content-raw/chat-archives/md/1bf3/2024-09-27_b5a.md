 I apologize, but I don't have enough specific information to identify the exact simulation you're referring to. Artificial life (alife) simulations with colorful, amoeba-like creatures are relatively common in the field. However, your description reminds me of a few possibilities:

1. **Tierra**: While not colorful, it's a classic alife simulation.

2. **Spore**: Though it's a game, its early stages feature amoeba-like creatures.

3. **Conway's Game of Life**: Many colorful variants exist of this classic cellular automaton.

4. **Primordial Life**: A software that simulates evolution of simple organisms.

Without more details about the year, the competition, or specific features of the simulation, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact one you saw. 

Q1: Do you remember approximately what year you saw this simulation?
Q2: Can you recall any specific behaviors or features of the creatures in the simulation?
Q3: Was this a 2D or 3D simulation, if you can remember?
