 Both S. boulardii and tibicos can be affected by light, but to different degrees:

S. boulardii:
1. **Light sensitivity**: Generally low
2. **Growth**: Not significantly impacted by light exposure
3. **Storage**: Often stored in light-proof containers, but mainly to control temperature

Tibicos (Water Kefir):
1. **Light sensitivity**: Moderate
2. **Growth**: Can be negatively affected by direct sunlight or strong artificial light
3. **Storage**: Typically recommended to ferment and store in dark or opaque containers

Key points:
- **Tibicos is more light-sensitive** than S. boulardii
- Light can affect the microbial balance in tibicos, potentially favoring unwanted organisms
- UV light can be harmful to both, but tibicos is more vulnerable due to its complex microbial community

For both cultures, avoiding direct sunlight and using opaque containers is generally recommended, though this is more critical for tibicos.

Q1: How might light exposure affect the production of beneficial compounds in tibicos fermentation?
Q2: Are there any potential benefits to controlled light exposure for either S. boulardii or tibicos cultures?
Q3: Could the difference in light sensitivity be leveraged to encourage S. boulardii growth in a tibicos culture?
