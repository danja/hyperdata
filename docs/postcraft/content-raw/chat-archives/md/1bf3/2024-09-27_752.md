 Based on your additional details, I believe you might be referring to **Chromaria**, which was created by Laura Sizer and won the GECCO (Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference) 2014 Open Source Software Competition.

Key features that match your description:

1. 2D simulation
2. Created around 2014
3. Amoeba-like creatures with realistic microscopic movement
4. Used primary colors (red, green, blue) for the organisms
5. Open-source demo available
6. Won a notable competition
7. Mentioned in some alife discussions and potentially on Wikipedia

Chromaria simulates the evolution of colorful, amoeba-like creatures in a 2D environment. The organisms' colors play a crucial role in their survival and reproduction, mimicking natural selection processes.

Q1: Do you recall if the simulation allowed user interaction or if it was purely observational?
Q2: Were there any specific evolutionary behaviors or adaptations you remember seeing in the simulation?
Q3: Do you remember if the environment in which the creatures lived had any distinctive features?
