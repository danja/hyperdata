 Regarding specific wavelengths of light that might be most beneficial or harmful to S. boulardii and tibicos cultures:

For S. boulardii:
1. **Harmful wavelengths**: 
   - **UV light** (100-400 nm): Particularly UVC (100-280 nm) is highly damaging to DNA and cell structures.
   - **Blue light** (450-495 nm): Can potentially generate reactive oxygen species, causing oxidative stress.

2. **Potentially beneficial wavelengths**:
   - **Red light** (620-750 nm): Some studies suggest it may stimulate growth in certain yeasts, though specific effects on S. boulardii are not well-documented.

For tibicos:
1. **Harmful wavelengths**:
   - **UV light** (100-400 nm): Damaging to most microorganisms in the culture.
   - **Visible light** (400-700 nm): Prolonged exposure, especially to blue and green wavelengths, can disrupt the microbial balance.

2. **Potentially beneficial wavelengths**:
   - **Far-red light** (700-850 nm): Some studies on other fermentations suggest it might stimulate beneficial bacteria without significantly affecting yeasts.

It's important to note that research on specific light effects on these cultures is limited. Most benefits of light exposure in fermentations have been observed in plant-based systems where photosynthetic organisms are involved.

Q1: How might different light wavelengths affect the production of specific metabolites in these cultures?
Q2: Could pulsed light exposure have different effects compared to continuous exposure?
Q3: Are there any known light-activated enzymes in the microorganisms typically found in tibicos that could be relevant?
