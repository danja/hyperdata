 Let me analyze this from both engineering and mathematical perspectives:

Engineering usage: A manifold could represent a central connection point where multiple pipelines converge or diverge - similar to an intake/exhaust manifold in an engine. This could be useful for:

1. Managing multiple parallel data flows
2. Load balancing across processors 
3. Combining/splitting data streams

Mathematical usage: The topological concept of a manifold (a space locally resembling Euclidean space) could inspire:

1. Dynamic reconfiguration of pipeline connections
2. Processing graphs with consistent local properties
3. Transformation mappings between data structures

Proposed implementation name: `ManifoldConnector`

Example usage:
```js
class ManifoldConnector extends Processor {
  // Maps input streams to output configurations
  constructor(mappingFunction) {
    this.mapping = mappingFunction;
    this.inlets = new Map();
    this.outlets = new Map(); 
  }
  
  route(message) {
    const targets = this.mapping(message);
    targets.forEach(target => this.emit(target, message));
  }
}
```

q1: Should manifold configuration be dynamic or static?
q2: How could backpressure be handled in a manifold setup?
q3: Would manifolds benefit from their own namespace in the configuration?
q4: Could manifolds be nested hierarchically?
