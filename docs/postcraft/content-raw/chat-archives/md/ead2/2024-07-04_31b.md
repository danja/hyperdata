 To update packages in a monorepo setup like this, you have a few options depending on what exactly you want to update. Here's a guide on how to handle different update scenarios:

1. Updating all packages:

From the root of your monorepo, you can run:

```bash
npm update
```

This will update all packages in all workspaces to their latest versions according to the version ranges specified in their package.json files.

2. Updating a specific package across all workspaces:

```bash
npm update <package-name> -ws
```

The `-ws` flag tells npm to run the command in all workspaces.

3. Updating packages in a specific workspace:

```bash
npm update -w packages/<app-name>
```

This updates all packages in the specified workspace.

4. Updating a specific package in a specific workspace:

```bash
npm update <package-name> -w packages/<app-name>
```

5. Checking for outdated packages:

To see which packages are outdated across all workspaces:

```bash
npm outdated -ws
```

6. Upgrading to major versions:

The update command respects semver ranges in your package.json. To upgrade to new major versions:

```bash
npm upgrade -ws
```

This will update your package.json files with the new versions.

7. Updating devDependencies in the root:

```bash
npm update --dev
```

8. Updating the common package in all applications:

If you've made changes to your common package and want to update its version in all applications:

a. First, increment the version in packages/common/package.json
b. Then, from the root directory, run:

```bash
npm install @my-monorepo/common@latest -ws
```

This will update the common package to the latest version in all workspaces.

Remember to commit your package.json and package-lock.json files after making updates. It's also a good practice to run your tests after updating packages to ensure everything still works as expected.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these update methods or explain anything else about package management in this monorepo setup?
