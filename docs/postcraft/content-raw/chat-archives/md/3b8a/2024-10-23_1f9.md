 Here's a brief description of each compound:

Lycopene: A bright red antioxidant that may help prevent cancer and heart disease

Beta-carotene: Converts to vitamin A in the body, essential for eye health and immune function

Anthocyanins: Purple/red pigments that may improve heart health and brain function

Resveratrol: A compound found in grape skins that may have anti-aging properties

Chlorophyll: The green pigment that plants use for photosynthesis; has detoxifying properties

Lutein: A yellow pigment crucial for eye health, especially protecting against age-related vision loss

Zeaxanthin: Works with lutein to protect eye health, particularly the retina

Would you like me to expand on any of these specifically?
