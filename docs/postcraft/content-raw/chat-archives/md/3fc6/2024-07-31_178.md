 To run a single test file in this project, you can use the following command:

```
npm test -- tests/integration/file-copy-remove-test.spec.js
```

This command uses the test script defined in package.json and passes the specific test file as an argument. The double dash (--) is used to separate npm's own arguments from those that should be passed to the script.

Q1: Are there any specific reporter options you'd like to use with Jasmine for this test?
Q2: Would you like to set up a watch mode for continuous testing during development?
Q3: Are there any environment variables that need to be set for this test?
