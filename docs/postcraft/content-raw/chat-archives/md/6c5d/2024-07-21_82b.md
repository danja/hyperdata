 Yes, you can replace a video you've uploaded to YouTube with an improved version without losing the original video's URL, view count, comments, or other associated data. This process is called "Video Replace" or "Swap Video." Here's how you can do it:

1. Sign in to YouTube Studio.

2. From the left menu, select "Content."

3. Find the video you want to replace and click on its title or thumbnail.

4. In the video details page, click on "More options" or the three-dot menu.

5. Select "Replace video" from the dropdown menu.

6. Upload your new, improved video file.

7. Once the upload is complete, you can choose to keep or update various elements like the title, description, thumbnail, etc.

8. Click "Replace" to confirm.

Important notes:
- The new video must not exceed 15 minutes unless your account is verified for longer uploads.
- You cannot change the video's duration by more than 10 seconds in either direction.
- It may take some time for the new video to process and appear.
- This feature is not available for livestream recordings or Shorts.

Keep in mind that while this preserves most metadata, it may reset some analytics data. Also, if your video is part of a playlist or has been embedded elsewhere, those links will now point to the new version.
