 I have analyzed the debugging output of the Fibonacci implementation in Sheltopusik.

Tasks completed:
1. Identified evaluator trace shows function definition succeeding
2. Located issue in function application stage
3. Found missing primitive handling for control structures
4. Determined recursion support needs enhancement

Solution:
The interpreter successfully parses and creates the lambda function but fails to execute the recursive calls. The evaluator needs to properly handle `if` expressions and maintain the environment chain for recursion.

Main fixes needed:
- Implement proper `if` evaluation in special forms
- Ensure environment chains persist through recursive calls  
- Add proper handling of function application for `fib`

q1: Should we add better error handling to show where evaluation fails?
q2: Would adding trace levels help in debugging the recursion?
q3: Do we need to modify how lambda closures capture their environment?
q4: Should we implement tail-call optimization while fixing recursion?
