 Understanding this falls into medical professional communication protocols and patient safety procedures during surgery. Let me provide a precise, standard response:

In a surgical setting, the surgeon typically states: "Please give additional anaesthetic" or "More anaesthetic needed" to the anesthesiologist, followed by any specific requirements.

The anesthesiologist maintains ultimate responsibility for anaesthetic management and will determine appropriate dosing.

q1: What communication protocols exist between surgeon and anesthesiologist during surgery?
q2: Are there standardized terms or phrases used for common surgical requests?
q3: How does the anaesthetic delivery confirmation process work?
q4: What role does surgical timeouts play in communication planning?

Note: While I can provide general information about medical communication protocols, specific medical procedures and dosing should be confirmed with qualified medical professionals.
