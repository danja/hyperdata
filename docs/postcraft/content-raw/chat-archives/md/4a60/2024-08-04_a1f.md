 To find the origin of a Git repository, you can use the following command:

```
git remote -v
```

This command will display the remote repositories associated with your local repository, including their URLs. The "origin" is typically the primary remote repository from which you cloned your local repository.

If you want to see only the URL for the origin, you can use:

```
git remote get-url origin
```

This command will display the URL of the remote repository named "origin".

If you're looking for the initial commit of the repository, you can use:

```
git rev-list --max-parents=0 HEAD
```

This will show you the hash of the very first commit in the repository's history.

Would you like me to explain any of these commands in more detail?
