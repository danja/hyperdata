 Let me help you manage these different Node.js environments across your submodules. This is a common issue when dealing with multiple projects that require different Node versions.

There are several ways to handle this:

1. **Using `.nvmrc` files**:
   Create a `.nvmrc` file in each submodule directory that specifies the required Node version. When you cd into each directory, you can simply run `nvm use` and it will automatically switch to the correct version.

   For sheltopusik:
   ```bash
   echo "20.11.0" > sheltopusik/.nvmrc
   ```

   For hyperdata-desktop:
   ```bash
   # Replace X.X.X with your required older version
   echo "X.X.X" > hyperdata-desktop/.nvmrc
   ```

2. **Using separate package-lock.json files**:
   Ensure each submodule has its own `package-lock.json` and don't share node_modules between them. This is usually the default behavior with Git submodules anyway.

3. **Using npm workspaces or isolation**:
   Add a `.npmrc` file in each submodule to ensure dependencies are installed locally:
   ```
   legacy-peer-deps=true
   shamefully-hoist=false
   ```

For your specific error with superstring and node-gyp, this suggests there might be native module compilation issues. To fix this:

1. First, ensure you're in the correct directory with the correct Node version:
   ```bash
   cd sheltopusik
   nvm use
   ```

2. Clear npm cache and node_modules:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

3. Reinstall with the correct Node version:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

If you're still having issues with node-gyp, you might need to:
```bash
npm install -g node-gyp
npm config set python python3
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches? Also, it would be helpful to know which Node version hyperdata-desktop needs to use specifically.
