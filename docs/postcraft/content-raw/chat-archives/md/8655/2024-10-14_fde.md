 Ah, I see. You're looking for a more general term that's often used in other contexts to express voluntary participation. Given that description, I think I know the word you're searching for. Is it "avocational"?

"Avocational developers" would describe people who engage in development as a secondary activity, done by choice rather than as a primary profession or out of necessity.

If that's not quite it, here are a few other possibilities that might fit the bill:

1. Discretionary developers
2. Elective developers
3. Optional developers
4. Volitional developers

These terms all emphasize the element of choice. However, I suspect "avocational" might be the word you're trying to recall, as it's often used in various contexts to describe activities people engage in voluntarily, separate from their main occupation or duty.

Does "avocational" match what you were trying to remember? If not, please let me know, and I can try to think of more options or we can explore the concept further.
