 Let me explain how to express a property that can accept either a string or URI value in OWL2. There are a few different ways we can model this, each with slightly different implications.

The most common approach is to use owl:unionOf to create a union class of datatypes. Here's how we can express it in Turtle syntax:

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

:relativePath a owl:DatatypeProperty, owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:range [
        a rdfs:Datatype ;
        owl:unionOf (
            xsd:string
            owl:Thing
        )
    ] .
```

Let's break down what's happening here. First, we declare :relativePath as both a DatatypeProperty and an ObjectProperty. This is necessary because we want it to accept both literal values (strings) and resources (URIs). Then we define its range as a union of xsd:string (for literal string values) and owl:Thing (which allows any URI reference).

An alternative approach, which might be more semantically precise, is to use owl:propertyDisjointWith to create two separate properties:

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

:relativePathString a owl:DatatypeProperty ;
    rdfs:range xsd:string ;
    owl:propertyDisjointWith :relativePathUri .

:relativePathUri a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:range owl:Thing .

:relativePath owl:equivalentProperty [
    a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    owl:unionOf ( :relativePathString :relativePathUri )
] .
```

This second approach has some advantages. It makes it clearer in the ontology that we're dealing with two fundamentally different types of values, and it allows us to add specific constraints or annotations to each type of path separately. However, it's more verbose and might be harder to work with in some applications.

We could even combine these approaches with OWL2's punning feature, which allows us to use the same IRI as both a class and a property:

```turtle
@prefix : <http://example.org/> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

:RelativePath a owl:Class ;
    owl:unionOf (
        [ a rdfs:Datatype ;
          owl:onDatatype xsd:string ]
        owl:Thing
    ) .

:relativePath a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:range :RelativePath .
```

Each of these approaches has its own trade-offs. The first is simpler and more straightforward, the second provides more precise semantic control, and the third leverages OWL2's more advanced features. The choice between them often depends on how the ontology will be used and what kind of reasoning you need to support.

Would you like me to explain more about how these different approaches might affect reasoning and validation in practice?
