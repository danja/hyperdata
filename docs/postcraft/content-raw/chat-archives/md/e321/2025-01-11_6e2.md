 I aim to be precise about this: while I'm familiar with discussions of artificial intuition as a concept and goal in AI development, I can't say with confidence if there is a specific formal algorithm that has been named "artificial intuition." Since this appears to be a technical question about a specific algorithm, I want to be clear that I may not be providing complete information.

Could you tell me more about where you encountered this algorithm or what context you heard about it in? That would help me better understand and discuss the specific implementation you're asking about.
