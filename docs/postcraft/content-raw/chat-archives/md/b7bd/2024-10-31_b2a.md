 Understood.

Music rights duration varies by jurisdiction and type of right. In the US:

- Copyright: Life of creator + 70 years
- Sound recordings (pre-1972): Until 2067
- Publishing rights: Same as copyright
- Performance rights: Same as copyright duration
- Mechanical rights: Compulsory license available after first recording

Primary focus: Standard copyright term of life + 70 years applies to most modern pop songs.

q1: How do music rights differ between the US and EU?
q2: What happens when a song has multiple composers?
q3: How are sampling rights handled differently from full song rights?
q4: What rights apply specifically to cover versions of songs?
