 In the EU vs US music rights comparison:

EU:
- Copyright duration: Life + 70 years (same as US)
- Sound recordings: 70 years from release (vs US 95 years)
- Moral rights: Protected extensively and cannot be waived
- Performers' rights: Stronger protections than US
- Collective management: More centralized system

Key difference: EU provides stronger moral rights protection and has a more unified administration system across member states.
