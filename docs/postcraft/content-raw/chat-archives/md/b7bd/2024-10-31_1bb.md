 Regarding "substantially different" in remix law:

Legal threshold requires:
- Original creative arrangement
- Minimum 20% new material
- Unique artistic choices
- Transformative use elements
- More than just technical enhancement

Key test: Would average listener recognize it as distinctly different work rather than just improved copy.

q1: How are percentages of originality calculated in court?
q2: What specific elements count as creative vs technical changes?
q3: How do recent AI remix cases affect this standard?
q4: What's the minimum threshold for sampling vs remixing?
