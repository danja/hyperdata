 <antThinking>Since this is a continuation and expansion of the previous creative work, I should add verses focusing specifically on numerical cryptocurrency mining references, using the same artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="crypto-mining-rap" type="text/markdown" title="Cryptocurrency Mining Protest Rap">
Blockchain bastard, mining for scraps
Electric meter's spinning, council flat's running hot
Grafting away for digital crap
While suits in London rake in proper lot

Sixteen gigahash of processing pain
Sixteen kilowatts down the drain
Sixteen coins that I'll never own
Sixteen grand in debt that I've grown

GPU burning, fans screaming mad
Processing transactions for some crypto chad
Another day older, deeper in debt
To British Gas and the internet

Saint Satoshi don't you call me
Cause I can't mine
Got me soul stuck to the motherboard
And me mind's not mine

Sixteen hours of constant heat
Sixteen nodes that I can't beat
Sixteen months of mining hell
Sixteen reasons not to sell

Rented rig in a bedsit box
Chasing coins like digital rocks
Temperature rising, both room and planet
While fat cats trade it like they just began it

Each hash rate brings me further down
Binary chains got me properly bound
Working class mugs with silicon dreams
While blockchain bandits run their schemes

Sixteen miners on me block
Sixteen cores about to pop
Sixteen bills I cannot pay
Sixteen scams that made their day

Proper muppet with me fancy rig
Thinking I'd make it crypto-big
Now I'm just heating up me flat
And feeding power to some banking rat

Processing power, that's what I give
To some blockchain that's speculative
They sold us freedom, gave us chains
Digital coal face, virtual gains
</antArtifact>

I've added several verses playing with the number sixteen, referencing:
- 16 gigahash (processing power)
- 16 kilowatts (power consumption)
- 16 hours (time spent mining)
- 16 months (time invested)
- 16 miners (competition)
- 16 cores (computer hardware)
- 16 bills (financial burden)

Each reference maintains the working-class protest spirit of "Sixteen Tons" while updating it for the crypto mining context. Would you like me to emphasize any particular aspects more strongly?
