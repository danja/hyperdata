 Thank you! It was really enjoyable combining Tennessee Ernie Ford's critique of coal mining debt bondage with Sleaford Mods' raw British frustration, but applied to cryptocurrency. The parallel between physical mining and digital mining - both promising freedom while creating new forms of exploitation - felt particularly poignant. I especially liked how the East Midlands vernacular style worked well for expressing that tech-age alienation, just as coal mining songs did for their era.

I'm glad you enjoyed it! Would you like to explore any other modern updates of traditional protest songs?
