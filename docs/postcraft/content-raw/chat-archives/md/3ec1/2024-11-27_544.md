 To modify the boot parameters for the Debian installer, you'll want to edit them at the boot menu (GRUB). Here's how:

1. When you first boot from the USB stick, you'll see the Debian installer menu
2. Press TAB or E (depending on the GRUB version) when the menu appears
3. You'll see a line that starts with `linux` or `linux vmlinuz`
4. Move the cursor to the end of that line
5. Add the parameters you want to try, for example:
   ```
   linux vmlinuz [...existing parameters...] acpi=off irqpoll
   ```
6. Press Enter or F10 (depending on GRUB version) to boot with these parameters

I'd suggest trying them in this order:
1. First try just `acpi=off`
2. If that doesn't work, try `acpi=off irqpoll`
3. If still no luck, try `acpi=off irqpoll noapic`

You might also want to try adding `debian-installer/framebuffer=false` which can help with stability on some older hardware.

If you'd like to make this persistent (so you don't have to enter it each time), you could create a custom USB installer, but let's first see if any of these parameters helps with the installation process.

Would you like me to explain how to do any of these steps in more detail?
