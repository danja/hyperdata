 Looking at the new error logs, there are several issues occurring:

1. There are file descriptor leaks (`File descriptor 4/5 leaked on pps invocation`)
2. The debootstrap process is encountering corrupted data (`xzcat: corrupted data`)
3. There's a tar read error (`tar: short read`)
4. The installer is failing to properly handle the britty-udeb package
5. Finally, there's an issue accessing a gcc documentation file

Given you're installing to an internal IDE flash drive now (which is good!), let's try a few things:

1. First, at the initial boot menu, try adding these boot parameters:
   ```
   debian-installer/framebuffer=false acpi=off
   ```

2. If that still fails, try using the expert installation mode with these additional parameters:
   ```
   memtest noapic nolapic
   ```

3. Given you're using a 1GB IDE flash drive, make sure to:
   - Select the minimal installation option
   - Don't create a swap partition (or make it very small)
   - Use ext2 instead of ext4 for the filesystem (less overhead for flash storage)

The corrupted data and short read errors suggest there might be issues with either:
- The USB installer media itself (might need to recreate it)
- The RAM (try the memtest parameter)
- The IDE controller's interaction with the flash drive

Would you like to try these solutions in order, or would you prefer to verify the integrity of the installation media first?
