 Ah, this makes more sense now. This is a known issue that can occur when installing Debian on machines with Intel's C7 processor, particularly when doing USB-to-USB installations. The crash trace shows memory management and filesystem operations failing, which is consistent with the symptoms you're describing.

Several potential issues could be causing this:

1. Memory Management:
   - The C7 processor has some specific memory management quirks
   - The crash trace shows several memory-related operations (`lock_page_memcg`, `unlock_page_memcg`)

2. USB Storage Issues:
   - Installing from one USB to another can be problematic due to:
     - Power delivery limitations when both drives are drawing from the same USB bus
     - Resource conflicts when both devices are using the same USB controller
     - Potential instability in USB mass storage drivers (note the `usb_storage` module in the loaded modules list)

Here are some potential solutions you could try:

1. If possible, use a different installation method:
   - Install from a DVD instead of USB
   - If you must use USB, try installing to an internal drive instead of another USB

2. If you need to stick with USB-to-USB:
   - Use different USB ports, ideally on different controllers (typically front and back ports are on different controllers)
   - Try using a powered USB hub for one or both drives to ensure stable power delivery
   - Use the 'expert' installation mode and select conservative memory settings

3. Boot parameters that might help:
   - Add `acpi=off` to the boot parameters
   - Try adding `irqpoll` to the boot parameters
   - You might also try `noapic` or `nolapic`

Would you like me to explain how to modify any of these settings, or would you prefer to try a different installation approach first?
