 After analyzing the code, the pattern you're using appears to be a combination of the Strategy Pattern and Dependency Injection. The term for this specific implementation could be called "Dynamic Strategy Injection."

As for renaming "services" to better fit within the "transmissions" context and describe their function, here are some suggestions:

1. Processors
2. Transformers
3. Nodes
4. Stages
5. Handlers

Of these, "Processors" or "Transformers" seem to best describe what these components actually do - they process or transform messages as they pass through the transmission pipeline.

Q1: Which of these suggested names do you think best fits the architecture and purpose of your system?
Q2: Are there any specific aspects of the current "services" that aren't captured well by these alternative names?
Q3: How would renaming "services" affect the rest of your codebase and architecture?
