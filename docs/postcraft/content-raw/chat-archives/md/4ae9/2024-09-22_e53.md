In the code attached there's a dir of src, services. Each service is a subclass of Service which processes a message by calling the execute method. A variant of dependency injection is used - please analyse, give me the correct term. But I'm not happy with the naming. 'Services' is a very overloaded term in software, and it doesn't seem consistent with 'transmissions'. Please suggest some better names than 'services' that fit better inside 'transmissions' and better describe what they actually do.
