 Certainly. Here are some suitable synonyms for "transformers" that could fit well within the context of your "transmissions" system:

1. Processors
2. Handlers
3. Operators
4. Stages
5. Nodes
6. Filters
7. Adapters
8. Converters
9. Modifiers
10. Components

Each of these terms carries slightly different connotations:

- "Processors" emphasizes the data processing aspect.
- "Handlers" suggests managing or dealing with data.
- "Operators" implies performing operations on data.
- "Stages" or "Nodes" highlight the pipeline structure.
- "Filters" suggests selective processing or transformation.
- "Adapters" or "Converters" emphasize changing data from one form to another.
- "Modifiers" focuses on changing or adjusting data.
- "Components" is a more general term for modular parts of a system.

Q1: Which of these alternatives do you feel best captures the essence of what your current "services" do?
Q2: Are there any specific functionalities of your system that might be better described by one of these terms?
Q3: How important is it for the chosen term to convey the idea of data transformation specifically?
