 To rename files recursively from '*Service*' to 'Processor' on Linux, you can use the `find` command combined with `sed` and `rename`. Here's a one-liner that should do the job:

```bash
find . -type f -name '*Service*' -exec bash -c 'mv "$1" "${1//Service/Processor}"' _ {} \;
```

This command:
1. Finds all files with 'Service' in the name
2. Executes a bash command for each file
3. Renames the file, replacing 'Service' with 'Processor'

For directories, you can add another similar command:

```bash
find . -type d -name '*Service*' -exec bash -c 'mv "$1" "${1//Service/Processor}"' _ {} \;
```

Be cautious when running these commands. It's advisable to test in a safe directory first.

Q1: Would you like a breakdown of how this command works?
Q2: Do you need to preserve case sensitivity in the renaming process?
Q3: Are there any specific directories or files you want to exclude from this renaming?
