 You're welcome. "Transformers" is indeed a good choice as it clearly conveys the idea of components that change or process data as it flows through your system.

To implement this change:

1. Rename the `services` directory to `transformers`
2. Update import statements throughout the codebase
3. Rename `Service` base class to `Transformer`
4. Update any configuration files or documentation

This change will make your code more self-descriptive and aligned with the "transmissions" concept.

Q1: Would you like guidance on refactoring the codebase to implement this name change?
Q2: Are there any specific transformers that might need special consideration during this renaming process?
Q3: How do you envision this name change affecting the conceptual model of your system for new developers or users?
