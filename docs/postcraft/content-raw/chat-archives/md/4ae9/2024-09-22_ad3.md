 After analyzing the code structure and pattern, it appears you're using a combination of the Strategy Pattern and Dependency Injection. The specific implementation could be termed "Dynamic Strategy Injection" or "Configurable Pipeline Processing."

For renaming "services" to better align with the "transmissions" concept and describe their function more accurately, consider these alternatives:

1. Processors
2. Transformers
3. Stages
4. Nodes
5. Operators

Of these, "Processors" or "Transformers" seem most fitting, as they accurately describe the role of processing or transforming messages within a transmission pipeline.

Q1: Which of these suggested names resonates most with your vision for the system's architecture?
Q2: Are there any specific functionalities of the current "services" that might not be fully captured by these alternative names?
Q3: How extensively would renaming "services" impact your existing codebase and overall architecture?
