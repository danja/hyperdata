 To change 'Service' to 'Processor' within files, you can use the `sed` command in combination with `find`. Here's a command that will do this recursively:

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.js" -exec sed -i 's/Service/Processor/g' {} +
```

This command:
1. Finds all .js files in the current directory and subdirectories
2. Uses `sed` to replace all occurrences of 'Service' with 'Processor'
3. The `-i` flag makes changes in-place

Be cautious with this command as it will modify your files directly. It's advisable to have a backup or use version control.

For case-sensitive replacement, use:

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.js" -exec sed -i 's/Service/Processor/g; s/service/processor/g' {} +
```

Q1: Do you need to limit this replacement to specific directories?
Q2: Are there any instances of 'Service' that should not be replaced?
Q3: Would you like to see a dry-run version of this command that shows changes without making them?
