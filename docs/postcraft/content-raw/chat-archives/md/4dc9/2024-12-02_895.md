 "Presque vu" (meaning "almost seen" in French) would most commonly be used by psychologists, neuroscientists, and other researchers studying memory and cognition. It refers to the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon where someone feels they're on the verge of remembering something but can't quite access it. It's similar to "déjà vu" but describes the frustrating sensation of almost, but not quite, retrieving a memory or piece of information.

Writers and literary critics might also use this term when discussing the psychological state of characters or analyzing works that deal with memory, consciousness, and perception. It's less commonly known than déjà vu, but appears occasionally in academic writing and discussions about memory phenomena.

Would you like me to explain more about how this phenomenon works from a cognitive perspective?
