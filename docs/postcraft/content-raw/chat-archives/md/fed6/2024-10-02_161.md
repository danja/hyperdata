# [Adjusting Todo List Priority with Machine Learning](https://claude.ai/chat/fed6e4d6-22a2-44a1-a10f-67e4bfd25ed4)

 As an expert in JavaScript and machine learning, I can suggest a few approaches for adjusting priority values based on external factors:

1. Weighted Average:
   priority_adjusted = (initial_priority * w1 + boost_factor * w2) / (w1 + w2)
   Where w1 and w2 are weights you can adjust.

2. Multiplicative Boost:
   priority_adjusted = initial_priority * (1 + boost_factor)

3. Logistic Function:
   priority_adjusted = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-k * (initial_priority + boost_factor - 0.5)))
   Where k controls the steepness of the curve.

These formulas are used in various contexts, including recommendation systems, risk assessment, and decision-making algorithms.

Q1: Would you like an implementation of one of these formulas in JavaScript?
Q2: Are there specific external factors you're considering for the boost/cut values?
Q3: How do you plan to normalize the adjusted priority to ensure it stays within the 0-1 range?
