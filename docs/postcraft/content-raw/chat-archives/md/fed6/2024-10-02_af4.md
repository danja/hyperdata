 In the scenario of approaching project milestones, the time-sensitive nature of tasks calls for a dynamic priority adjustment. Let's compare the utility of the suggested formulas:

1. Weighted Average:
   Less suitable here, as it doesn't naturally capture the inverse relationship with time.

2. Multiplicative Boost:
   More appropriate. We can define boost_factor as 1 / (time_remaining + 1).
   priority_adjusted = initial_priority * (1 + 1 / (time_remaining + 1))
   This provides a smooth increase in priority as the deadline approaches.

3. Logistic Function:
   Also suitable, offering a more nuanced S-curve adjustment:
   priority_adjusted = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-k * (initial_priority - 0.5 + 1 / (time_remaining + 1))))
   This provides a gradual increase that accelerates as the deadline nears.

The Multiplicative Boost is simpler and more intuitive, while the Logistic Function offers more control over the rate of priority increase.

Q1: Would you prefer a linear or non-linear relationship between time remaining and priority boost?
Q2: How far in advance of the milestone do you want to start applying the boost?
Q3: Are there other time-related factors besides the milestone that could influence task priority?
