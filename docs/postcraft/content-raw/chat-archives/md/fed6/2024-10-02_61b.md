 To incorporate weights for each factor, we can modify the calculation to use a weighted sum. Here's an implementation:

```javascript
const calculatePriority = (
  initialImportance, opinionFactor, deadlineFactor,
  weightImportance, weightOpinion, weightDeadline,
  k = 5
) => {
  // Normalize weights
  const totalWeight = weightImportance + weightOpinion + weightDeadline;
  const normWeightImportance = weightImportance / totalWeight;
  const normWeightOpinion = weightOpinion / totalWeight;
  const normWeightDeadline = weightDeadline / totalWeight;

  // Calculate weighted sum
  const weightedSum = 
    initialImportance * normWeightImportance -
    opinionFactor * normWeightOpinion +
    deadlineFactor * normWeightDeadline;

  // Apply logistic function
  return 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-k * (weightedSum - 0.5)));
};

// Example usage
const priority = calculatePriority(0.7, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.3, 0.7);
console.log(priority);
```

This approach normalizes the weights to ensure they sum to 1, then applies them to each factor.

Q1: Do you want to add any constraints on the weights, such as a minimum value?
Q2: How do you plan to determine the initial weights for each factor?
Q3: Would you like to see a visualization of how changing weights affects the priority?
