 I'll address all questions:

Q1: Vector similarity thresholds should be tuned by:
- Running clustering analysis on domain samples
- Adjusting based on vector dimensionality
- Using silhouette scores to optimize
- Implementing dynamic thresholds based on intra-domain variance

For example:
```javascript
function getDynamicThreshold(domain, vectors) {
    const intraDomainSimilarities = computeIntraDomainSimilarities(domain, vectors);
    return mean(intraDomainSimilarities) - standardDeviation(intraDomainSimilarities);
}
```

Q2: Additional temporal RDF predicates:
```turtle
comm:creationTime    # When community was first detected
comm:lastModified    # Last community membership change
comm:evolutionStage  # Growth/stable/declining
comm:membershipDuration # How long a node has been in community
comm:seasonality     # For temporal patterns
```

Q3: Incremental community detection through:
- Maintaining boundary sets of each community
- Using local updates for new nodes
- Implementing split/merge operations
- Caching community statistics
```javascript
async updateCommunities(newVectors) {
    const affectedCommunities = this.findAffectedCommunities(newVectors);
    return Promise.all(affectedCommunities.map(comm => 
        this.recomputeCommunityBoundaries(comm, newVectors)
    ));
}
```

Q4: Community coherence validation:
- Compute semantic cohesion using domain ontologies
- Measure term overlap between members
- Calculate topic consistency using LDA
- Use external knowledge bases for validation
```javascript
async validateCommunity(community) {
    const semanticCoherence = await computeTermOverlap(community);
    const topicConsistency = await analyzeTopicDistribution(community);
    return (semanticCoherence + topicConsistency) / 2 > COHERENCE_THRESHOLD;
}
```

Q1: How could we automatically adjust community boundaries based on domain-specific rules?

Q2: What approaches could be used to identify and handle outlier nodes that don't fit well in any community?

Q3: How can we efficiently merge communities that become more similar over time?

Q4: What metrics would be most useful for tracking community evolution over time?
