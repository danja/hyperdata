 Yes, this can be represented as a network diagram using Mermaid syntax, which will help visualize the flow and relationships more clearly.

<antThinking>This would be best represented as a Mermaid flowchart to show the directed relationships between components. Since it's a complex diagram that will be rendered, it warrants creation as an artifact.</antThinking>

Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isnâ€™t yet supported on mobile.

I've converted your pipeline into a Mermaid flowchart that shows:
1. The DirWalker (p10) as the root node
2. Four parallel paths through StringFilter (p20) components
3. Each path continuing through FileReader, FileContainer, CaptureAll, WhiteboardToMessage, and Unfork
4. All paths converging at the final FileWriter (p80)

The diagram makes it easier to visualize the parallel processing paths and the final convergence point. Would you like any adjustments to the layout or component representation?
