 Earthworms have a relatively simple nervous system compared to many other animals, but it's still quite fascinating. Let's look at what we know about earthworm neurobiology:

<antThinking>This question is again about a specific biological detail that might not be widely documented. I should provide the information I have about earthworm neurobiology, but be cautious about giving exact numbers for synapses, as this might not be well-established in the literature. I'll focus on what's more confidently known about earthworm nervous systems.</antThinking>

Earthworms have a decentralized nervous system that consists of:

1. A brain-like structure called the cerebral ganglion
2. A ventral nerve cord running along the length of the body
3. Segmental ganglia in each body segment

Key points about the earthworm nervous system:

1. Neurons: An earthworm has approximately 300 neurons per segment. With about 100 segments in a typical earthworm, this amounts to roughly 30,000 neurons in total.

2. Ganglia: The cerebral ganglion contains about 2,000 neurons, while each segmental ganglion has about 300 neurons.

3. Synapses: The exact number of synapses is not well-documented in the literature I'm familiar with. However, we can make a rough estimate:

   If we assume each neuron forms 100-1000 synapses (as we did with the ant), we might estimate anywhere from 3 million to 30 million synapses in an earthworm's nervous system.

It's important to note that earthworms have a unique nervous system structure. Unlike vertebrates or even many invertebrates, much of their nervous system function is distributed throughout their body segments. This allows them to respond to stimuli even if part of their body is separated.

As with the ant example, I want to emphasize that the synaptic estimate is a rough approximation. The actual number could vary significantly, and this level of detail for earthworm neurobiology might not be precisely known. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, it would be best to consult recent research in invertebrate neurobiology.
