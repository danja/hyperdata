 To estimate how many pages of regular text correspond to 128,000 tokens for a typical language model, we need to make a few assumptions:

1. An average English word is about 5 characters long.
2. Most language models use subword tokenization, where a token is typically shorter than a full word. Let's assume an average of 4 tokens per word.
3. A typical A4 academic paper page contains about 500 words.

Given these assumptions:

1. 128,000 tokens ÷ 4 tokens per word ≈ 32,000 words
2. 32,000 words ÷ 500 words per page ≈ 64 pages

So, roughly speaking, 128,000 tokens would correspond to approximately 60-70 pages of regular text in an A4 academic paper format.

Keep in mind that this is a rough estimate. The actual number of pages could vary based on factors such as:

- The specific tokenization method used by the language model
- The complexity and vocabulary of the text
- Formatting elements like headers, footnotes, and references
- Font size and spacing

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this estimation or explain how tokenization works in language models?
