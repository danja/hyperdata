 Mozart's genuine letters provide some insights into his compositional process, though they don't give us a complete picture. Here are some key points from his authentic correspondence:

1. Mental composition: In a letter to his father from 1780, Mozart wrote about composing in his head: "When I am, as it were, completely myself, entirely alone, and of good cheer...my ideas flow best and most abundantly. Whence and how they come, I know not; nor can I force them."

2. Speed of composition: In several letters, Mozart mentions composing quickly. For example, in a 1783 letter to his father, he wrote about composing three piano concertos in a short time: "These concertos are a happy medium between what is too easy and too difficult; they are very brilliant, pleasing to the ear, and natural, without being vapid."

3. Revision process: Contrary to the myth that he never needed to revise, Mozart occasionally mentioned making changes. In a 1784 letter about his string quartets, he wrote: "I assure you that I took great pains and devoted a long time to composing them."

4. Multitasking: In his letters, Mozart often mentions working on multiple pieces simultaneously, suggesting his ability to juggle different compositions in his mind.

5. Inspiration from other composers: Mozart's letters show that he was aware of and sometimes inspired by the work of his contemporaries and predecessors.

It's important to note that while these letters give us some insight, Mozart didn't write extensively about his creative process. Much of what we know comes from piecing together various comments and references across his correspondence.

Would you like me to expand on any of these points or discuss how these letters compare to other sources of information about Mozart's compositional methods?
