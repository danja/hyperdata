 This is an interesting question about Mozart's creative process. You're right to be cautious about some of the descriptions that have circulated, as there has indeed been some mythologizing and exaggeration around Mozart's compositional methods.

The most famous (and largely discredited) account comes from an 1815 letter supposedly written by Mozart, describing how entire compositions would form in his mind instantly and perfectly. This letter was actually a fabrication by Friedrich Rochlitz, a music critic and publisher.

However, there are some more reliable sources that give us insight into Mozart's working methods:

1. Mozart's own letters: In his authentic correspondence, Mozart occasionally mentions his compositional process, though not in great detail.

2. Sketches and drafts: While Mozart was known for his remarkable ability to compose quickly and with few corrections, musicologists have found sketches and draft versions of some of his works, showing that he did engage in revision and refinement.

3. Accounts from contemporaries: Some of Mozart's friends and family members left descriptions of his working methods, though these should still be approached with some caution.

From these sources, we can gather that Mozart did have an extraordinary ability to compose quickly and to hold complex musical ideas in his mind. He often worked out compositions mentally before writing them down, but he didn't simply transcribe fully-formed pieces from his imagination as some myths suggest.

Mozart was known to compose while engaged in other activities, and he could work on multiple pieces simultaneously. He also had a vast knowledge of musical styles and forms that he could draw upon, which contributed to his speed and fluency in composition.

It's worth noting that our understanding of Mozart's creative process is still evolving as musicologists continue to study his manuscripts and correspondence. While we have a clearer picture now than in the past, there's still much debate and research ongoing in this area.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of Mozart's compositional methods or the sources we have for understanding them?
