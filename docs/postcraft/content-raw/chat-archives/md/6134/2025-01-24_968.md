This appears to go through one cycle correctly, then falls over. Check the source in project knowledge. As well as fixing the immediate problem we should look to improved monitoring and status messaging. Use the loglevel lib rather than console.

Response: AI technology has been advancing rapidly in recent years. Here are some key areas of progress and the current state:
1. Machine Learning & Deep Learning: Significant advancements have been made in machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning neural networks. This has enabled AI systems to learn from vast amounts of data and achieve human-level or even superhuman performance on specific tasks like image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): Language models like GPT-3 and PaLM have demonstrated remarkable language understanding and generation capabilities. They can engage in human-like conversations, answer questions, summarize text, and even write creatively. However, challenges remain in areas like common sense reasoning and avoiding biases.
3. Computer Vision: Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision, allowing AI to accurately detect, classify and segment objects and scenes in images and videos. Applications range from facial recognition to self-driving cars. 
4. Robotics: AI is enabling more intelligent and autonomous robots that can perceive their environment, navigate, manipulate objects and interact with humans. However, robots still struggle with the dexterity, adaptability and general intelligence of humans.
5. Narrow AI vs. General AI: Most of today's AI systems are considered "narrow AI" - highly capable at specific tasks but lacking the adaptability and general intelligence of humans. Creating Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that can match human intelligence across all domains remains a grand challenge.
6. AI Ethics & Safety: As AI systems become more powerful, there are important considerations around making them safe, transparent, unbiased and aligned with human values. This is an active area of research and policy development.
In summary, AI has made huge strides and is transforming many domains, but significant technical and ethical challenges remain in creating AI systems with human-level, general intelligence. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of this!
