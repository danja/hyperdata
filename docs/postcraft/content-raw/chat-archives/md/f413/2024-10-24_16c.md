I very much like what you are saying. Assume we are looking at knowledge management and and processing systems, which include aspects like language models as well as more structured logical ontologies. How, in practice, might you evaluate the level of stability? There is the notion of temperature in probabilistic systems such as those around generative models, but how can we project a broader map, concept of phase state over a variety of systems?
