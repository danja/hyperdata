Before going any further, I'd like to record a summary of what you have developed as Coherence Tensors. Please condense this into a page or two. Don't include the code, we will come back to the implementation details. Starting around where you suggest a Tensor Structure Design, can you systematically give a very concise version of the key points, the components, their roles and relationships with each other and external systems.  Organise this material in a structured fashion and provide a short abstract as well as a proposal for how the work should proceed, the next steps towards building a useful system.
