 Excellent approach. Let's first list out some general problem-solving strategies, then examine how each might behave when applied to something that resists concrete form.

Standard Problem-Solving Strategies:
1. Decomposition - breaking into smaller parts
2. Analogy/metaphor - mapping to familiar domains
3. Systematic enumeration - listing all aspects
4. Visual representation/diagramming
5. Working backwards from known outcomes
6. Pattern recognition/categorization
7. Abstraction/generalization
8. Constraint identification
9. State transformation (like in math proofs)
10. Example generation/case studies

Let's examine each:

1. Decomposition
- Challenge: The parts may be as ethereal as the whole
- Potential: Might help identify which aspects are more "graspable" than others
- Like trying to divide fog - you can section the space, but the boundaries remain permeable

2. Analogy/Metaphor
- Seems particularly suited to this type of problem
- Each metaphor captures some aspects while losing others
- Could build a constellation of metaphors that together triangulate the concept
- Similar to how particle/wave duality helps us understand light

3. Systematic Enumeration
- Might help identify the "edges" of the concept
- Could list what we know it's not, creating a negative space definition
- Risk: Could be like trying to count water molecules in a wave

Would you like me to continue with the remaining strategies, or shall we dive deeper into any of these first three? I'm particularly interested in exploring how the "negative space" approach might work here.
