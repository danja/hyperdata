There is an attention aspect to this, hold that thought. It is strange, the thing I'm trying to express is the same thing that makes it difficult to express. Somewhere a hint of Plato's cave.  Trying to manipulate shapes, unsuccessfully because the things being interacted with are only a projection of the real shapes. Language in the abstract is here. Maybe like when a person uses a gesture, without there being a physical target.
