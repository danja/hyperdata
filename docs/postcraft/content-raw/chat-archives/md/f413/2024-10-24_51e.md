 I'll revise the explanation of contextual thickness to make it more precise and illustrate its role in the tensor framework.

<antThinking>This warrants updating our existing artifact to clarify an important foundational concept.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="coherence-tensors" type="text/markdown" title="Coherence Tensors: A Framework for Knowledge Stability Analysis">

[Previous sections remain the same until the Tensor Structure explanation, which is revised as follows:]

### 1. Tensor Structure
Four primary dimensions:
- Representation type (r): logical, probabilistic, linguistic
- Abstraction level (a): degree of generalization
- Precision/formality (p): specificity and formal rigor
- Contextual thickness (t): depth and breadth of contextual support required for concept stability, including:
  * Definitional context: Supporting concepts needed for meaning
  * Operational context: Required procedures or methods
  * Relational context: Network of interconnected concepts
  * Environmental context: External conditions for validity
  
Example of contextual thickness levels:
- Thin: "2 + 2 = 4" (minimal context needed)
- Medium: "Supply increases when price rises" (requires economic framework)
- Thick: "Quantum entanglement" (requires extensive physics context)
- Very thick: "Cultural appropriation" (requires historical, social, ethical contexts)

[Remainder of document remains the same]

</antArtifact>

This revision better illustrates how contextual thickness serves as a measure of the supporting knowledge environment required for concept stability. It shows how different types of knowledge require different levels and types of contextual support to maintain coherence and meaning.

Would you like me to elaborate further on how contextual thickness interacts with the other tensor dimensions, or explore specific examples of how it affects phase transitions?
