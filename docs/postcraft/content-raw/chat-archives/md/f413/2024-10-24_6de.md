 This is a fascinating conceptual challenge - trying to capture that experience of grasping at something that seems to disperse in the very act of trying to grasp it. Let me explore some phrases and analogies:

1. Like trying to make a fist around water - you can feel its presence, but the tighter you squeeze, the more it escapes between your fingers

2. Similar to when you're waking from a dream and can feel the rich tapestry of meaning dissolving even as you reach for it - that sensation of "I just had it, it was all connected..."

3. Like trying to describe the exact shape of a cloud - from a distance it has a clear form, but the closer you get, the more you realize it's all edges and no boundaries

4. That moment when you're trying to remember a word and it's "on the tip of your tongue" - you can feel its conceptual weight, its semantic neighborhood, but the more directly you try to look at it, the more it retreats

5. Like attempting to focus your eyes on the floating specks in your vision - they're clearly there in your peripheral awareness, but try to look straight at them and they dart away

6. Similar to trying to maintain awareness of your own breathing - the moment you consciously attend to it, it shifts from automatic to manual, and something about its natural rhythm is lost

Would you say any of these capture aspects of what you're describing? I'm particularly curious about whether the distinction between peripheral versus direct attention resonates with your experience of this phenomenon.
