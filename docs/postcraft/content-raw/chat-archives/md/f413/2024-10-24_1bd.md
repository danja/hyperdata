 Let me think through how we might measure and map stability across different types of knowledge systems...

1. Stability Indicators Across System Types:

Probabilistic Systems (like LLMs):
- Traditional temperature measures probability distribution spread
- Could extend to measure "coherence persistence" across multiple generations
- Track how concepts maintain consistency under different sampling conditions
- Measure entropy changes when concept boundaries are perturbed

Logical Systems:
- Stability might be measured by invariance under transformation
- How many predicates/relations can be removed before logical consistency fails
- Dependency depth in ontological structures
- Minimal axiom sets required for theorem preservation

Bridging Metrics:
- Rate of "phase transitions" when moving between system types
- How much context/structure is needed to maintain equivalent meanings
- Information loss patterns during system transitions
- Stability of mappings between different representation forms

2. Practical Measurement Approaches:

For a given knowledge chunk:
- Measure coherence retention under progressive context reduction
- Find threshold points where meaning becomes unstable
- Track how stability requirements change across:
  * Levels of abstraction
  * Types of reasoning tasks
  * Translation between formal/informal representations

3. Stability Assessment Framework:

Define stability levels based on:
```
- Context Dependency: How much supporting context needed
- Transform Resilience: How well meaning preserves under operations
- Boundary Conditions: What environmental factors affect stability
- Phase Transition Points: Where fundamental changes in behavior occur
```

4. Implementation Considerations:

Need to measure:
- Internal consistency (within system type)
- Cross-system stability (between representations)
- Operational stability (under different uses)
- Temporal stability (across sequential operations)

Would you like me to develop any of these aspects further? I'm particularly interested in exploring how we might create practical metrics for measuring concept stability across different knowledge representation systems - perhaps starting with some concrete examples of how concepts behave differently in probabilistic versus logical frameworks?
