I'm looking for some good phrases that convey this concept. A person is trying to express an idea, represent it, or communicate it. They have a strong sense they have the components in their conceptual space, a strong sense there is a coherent structure that can describe this shape as a kind of unified whole. But somehow in the act of trying to gather the thing, it gets harder to pin down. Somewhere around trying to take hold of mist. Or maybe when it seems there is a solid form of the notion, analogeous to a material solid, say ice, but in the current environment the temperature is such that it only exists in liquid or gas form. Can you please look for some solid in what I'm describing, see if you can find analogies or wording that capture this, that can be use to communicate and/or reason with the idea.
