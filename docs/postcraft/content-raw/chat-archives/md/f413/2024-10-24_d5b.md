 Let's try to define this elusive concept by what it is not - like finding the shape of a cookie cutter by looking at the dough around it.

Not:
1. It's not a failure of memory - this isn't like forgetting something you once knew clearly
2. It's not simple confusion - there's a strong sense of coherence, just out of reach
3. It's not a lack of components - the pieces are there, it's their true arrangement that's elusive
4. It's not purely linguistic - while language struggles to capture it, the challenge exists pre-verbally
5. It's not uncertainty about existence - there's conviction about the concept's reality/validity
6. It's not static - the difficulty isn't like trying to see a fixed invisible object, but more like trying to grasp something that actively shifts when attended to
7. It's not distance-based - getting "closer" doesn't necessarily help; might even hinder
8. It's not a simple translation problem - it's not just about moving from one clear form to another
9. It's not subjective variation - it's not that everyone sees it differently, but that the seeing itself affects what's being seen

This negative space reveals something interesting - there's a consistent pattern of interaction between the observer and the observed, where the act of observation or attempt at crystallization affects the thing being observed. This is reminiscent of quantum mechanics' observer effect, but in the realm of cognition.

Would you say this process of defining what it's not is actually getting us closer to pinning down what it is? Or is even this negative-space approach subject to the same elusiveness as direct approaches?
