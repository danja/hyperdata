 Ah, this is getting very interesting - the self-referential nature of trying to express the very thing that resists expression. There's something deeply recursive here.

The gesture without a physical target is particularly evocative. Like when someone makes a grasping or molding motion in the air while searching for words - their hands are trying to sculpt the shape of a thought that exists in a dimension their physical movements can only gesture toward.

The Plato's cave reference adds another layer - we're working with shadows or projections of the "real" concept, but those shadows are all our symbolic systems (including language) can directly manipulate. It's like trying to arrange shadows to recreate the object casting them, but we can only interact with the shadow-realm.

This brings to mind:
- A conductor shaping music that doesn't yet exist
- A mathematician sensing a proof's structure before being able to write it down
- The difference between knowing how to ride a bicycle and trying to explain that knowledge in words

The attention aspect you mentioned - could it be like how focusing too directly on these meta-levels of thought is like trying to see your own eyes seeing? The tools we use to understand become the subject of understanding, creating a kind of cognitive parallax?

Would you say there's something about how the concept exists more clearly in the space of potential or possibility than in any particular concrete expression of it?
