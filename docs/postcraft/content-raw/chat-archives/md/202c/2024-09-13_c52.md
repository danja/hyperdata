 Atom and Visual Studio Code (VSCode) are both popular open-source text editors, but they have some significant architectural and implementation differences. Let's explore these differences at both the architectural and bottom-level implementation levels:

Architectural Level:

1. Core Architecture:
   - Atom: Built on Electron, which combines Chromium and Node.js. It uses a package-based architecture where nearly everything is a package.
   - VSCode: Also built on Electron, but uses a more modular architecture with a core editor and extensibility model.

2. Extension System:
   - Atom: Packages are deeply integrated into the core. Almost every feature is a package, including core functionalities.
   - VSCode: Uses a cleaner separation between the core editor and extensions. The core is more monolithic, with extensions adding functionality on top.

3. UI Framework:
   - Atom: Uses its own UI framework called Atom-Shell (later renamed to Electron).
   - VSCode: Uses a custom UI framework built on top of Electron, with more native-like performance optimizations.

4. Language Support:
   - Atom: Primarily written in CoffeeScript (later transitioned to JavaScript) and Less for styling.
   - VSCode: Primarily written in TypeScript, which offers stronger typing and better tooling support.

Bottom-level Implementation:

1. Text Buffer Implementation:
   - Atom: Uses a custom text buffer implementation with a piece table data structure.
   - VSCode: Uses a highly optimized text buffer implementation based on a piece tree data structure, which provides better performance for large files.

2. Rendering:
   - Atom: Relies more heavily on DOM for rendering, which can lead to performance issues with large files.
   - VSCode: Uses a custom rendering engine (Monaco) that minimizes DOM usage, resulting in better performance, especially for large files.

3. File Watching:
   - Atom: Uses Pathwatcher, a native Node.js module for file system events.
   - VSCode: Uses a combination of native file system watchers and intelligent polling, with optimizations for different operating systems.

4. Search Implementation:
   - Atom: Primarily uses ripgrep for searching, integrated later in its lifecycle.
   - VSCode: Has used ripgrep from earlier on, with deeper integration and optimizations.

5. Process Model:
   - Atom: Single-process model where extensions run in the same process as the core editor.
   - VSCode: Multi-process model where extensions can run in separate processes, improving stability and performance isolation.

6. Language Server Protocol (LSP) Integration:
   - Atom: Added LSP support later through community packages.
   - VSCode: Built with LSP support from the ground up, offering tighter integration and better performance.

7. Git Integration:
   - Atom: Git functionality is provided through packages.
   - VSCode: Has a deeply integrated Git experience built into the core.

8. Performance Optimizations:
   - Atom: Less focus on performance optimizations, especially in later stages of development.
   - VSCode: Heavy focus on performance, with continuous optimizations for startup time, memory usage, and responsiveness.

These differences reflect the different design philosophies and evolution of the two editors. Atom's highly package-based architecture offered great flexibility but sometimes at the cost of performance and complexity. VSCode's more modular approach with a strong core and extension model has allowed for better performance optimizations and a more consistent user experience.

It's worth noting that Atom's development was officially discontinued by GitHub (owned by Microsoft) in December 2022, with the team focusing their efforts on GitHub Codespaces and VSCode. This decision was partly due to the significant overlap between Atom and VSCode, and VSCode's growing popularity and performance advantages.
