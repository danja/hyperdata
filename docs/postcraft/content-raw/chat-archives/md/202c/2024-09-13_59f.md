 I don't have any specific information about a text editor called "pulsar". There are many text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) used by programmers, but I don't have reliable data about one with that particular name in my knowledge base. 

It's possible you may be referring to a different editor, or to a relatively new or obscure tool that I don't have accurate information about. If you have any additional context or details about this editor, I'd be happy to try to provide more relevant information. Alternatively, I could discuss some of the history of other well-known code editors and IDEs if that would be helpful.
