 To write a parser for Turtle RDF syntax in Pharo Smalltalk, you would need a few key tools and libraries:

1. PetitParser: This is a powerful parsing framework for Pharo that allows you to build complex parsers using a combination of smaller parsers. It's well-suited for creating parsers for domain-specific languages like Turtle.

2. STOMP (Smalltalk Object Mapper): While not strictly necessary for parsing, this library can be useful for mapping the parsed RDF triples to Smalltalk objects, which might be helpful depending on how you plan to use the parsed data.

3. Roassal or Spec: These are visualization frameworks that could be useful if you want to create a graphical representation of the parsed RDF data.

4. SUnit: Pharo's built-in unit testing framework, which you'll want to use to ensure your parser is working correctly.

5. Iceberg: Pharo's git integration tool, which you'll use for version control of your project.

To get started, you would:

1. Set up a new Pharo image
2. Install PetitParser using Metacello or the Catalog browser
3. Create a new package for your Turtle parser
4. Start building your parser using PetitParser's combinator approach

Would you like me to provide a basic outline of how you might start implementing the parser using PetitParser?
