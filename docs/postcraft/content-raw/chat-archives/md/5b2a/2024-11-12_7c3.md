 Analyzed from knowledge management and AI training perspective:

Scale-free network concepts can optimize document processing by:
- Identifying key documents that serve as information hubs
- Creating hierarchical chunk structures based on natural connection patterns
- Building knowledge graphs where important concepts become hub nodes
- Prioritizing fine-tuning data based on hub document importance

Implementation approach:
1. Use semantic similarity to map document relationships
2. Identify hub documents containing core concepts
3. Structure chunks around hub-and-spoke patterns
4. Weight training data to emphasize hub document content
5. Build retrieval graphs with hub-based routing

q1: How would you identify optimal chunk size using network analysis?

q2: What metrics could determine if a document should be a hub node?

q3: How might fine-tuning weights be adjusted based on hub proximity?

q4: Could network topology help optimize retrieval paths?
