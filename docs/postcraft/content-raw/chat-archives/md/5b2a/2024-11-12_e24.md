 Understood. Here's a concise explanation:

Scale-free networks are systems where some members have many connections while most have very few - similar to how a few people at a party might know everyone while most only know a handful of others. Examples include social media networks, airline routes, and the internet itself. The pattern follows a "rich get richer" principle, where well-connected nodes tend to attract even more connections.

q1: How do scale-free networks differ from random networks?

q2: What makes the "rich get richer" effect work in these networks?

q3: Can you explain some real-world applications of scale-free network theory?

q4: What are the vulnerabilities of scale-free networks?
