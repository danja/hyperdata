 Addressing all four questions:

1. Optimal chunk size can be determined by:
- Analyzing natural breaks in semantic connectivity
- Measuring information density around potential hub points
- Testing retrieval performance at different granularities
- Finding the balance point where hub-spoke relationships remain clear

2. Hub document metrics:
- High semantic similarity with many other documents
- Frequency of concept overlap with other documents
- Citation or reference count within corpus
- Centrality measures from graph analysis

3. Fine-tuning weights could be adjusted by:
- Distance from nearest hub (closer = higher weight)
- Number of connections to hub documents
- Position in the hierarchical structure
- Contribution to overall network coherence

4. Network topology optimizes retrieval by:
- Creating efficient pathways through hub nodes
- Enabling multi-hop reasoning along strong connections
- Reducing search space using hub-based routing
- Providing context through network neighborhood

q1: How would dynamic document additions affect hub structure?

q2: Could hub analysis help identify knowledge gaps?

q3: What's the optimal hub-to-leaf ratio for retrieval?

q4: How might temporal aspects affect network structure?
