# [Troubleshooting SPARQL Endpoint Configuration Issues](https://claude.ai/chat/33ee4a06-86e5-412e-9d95-177fcb15a95b)

 Let me analyze this carefully. The issue is that the test file isn't being found. Looking at the project structure and test configuration:

1. The command attempts to run `tests/unit/sparql-endpoint-spec.js`
2. The error indicates no specs were found
3. Checking the repository files, the test is actually in `tests/integration/sparql/sparql-endpoint-spec.js`

Let's run the correct path:

```sh
npm test -- tests/integration/sparql/sparql-endpoint-spec.js
```

This appears to be a test organization issue. The test was placed in the integration folder since it tests against a live SPARQL endpoint, but the command is looking in the unit folder.

Before proceeding with endpoint configuration, we should first ensure we can run the test from its correct location.

Q1: Should we reorganize the test directory structure to better reflect test types?
Q2: Would you like to see the test's actual network requests first?
Q3: Should we modify the test to handle both unit and integration scenarios?
Q4: Would you like to review the jasmine.json configuration?
