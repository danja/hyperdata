I understand you want to find a humane solution. Here are some non-lethal suggestions to consider:

- Use humane traps to catch the mice and release them far away in a field or park. Be sure it's legal in your area first. 

- Seal up any entry points so more mice can't get in. Steel wool stuffed in cracks works well.

- Keep all human and pet food in sealed metal or glass containers so there's nothing for them to eat. Clean up all crumbs.

- Use natural peppermint oil deterrents. Mice don't like the smell. 

- Consider adopting a cat - they can be great mousers without actually killing them. The mice may leave from the cat's presence and scent alone.

- As a last resort if the mice are truly overrunning your home, contact a pest control company to explore options like relocation or humane deterrents.

I hope these give you some ideas to humanely and safely evict the mice. Let me know if you have any other questions!
