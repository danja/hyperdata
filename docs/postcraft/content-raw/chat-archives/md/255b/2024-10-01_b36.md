 Ah, I believe you might be referring to the French term "mise en scène," which is sometimes used in copyright discussions.

"Mise en scène" literally translates to "placing on stage" and refers to the arrangement of scenery and staging for a theatrical production. However, in a broader sense, it's used to describe the overall visual, thematic, and stylistic choices in various art forms, including film, theater, and literature.

In copyright contexts, "mise en scène" can relate to:

1. The overall creative vision or concept of a work
2. The arrangement and composition of elements within a creative work
3. The distinctive style or approach of a director or creator

The term is relevant in copyright discussions because there's often debate about whether the "mise en scène" itself can be copyrighted, especially in film and theater. Some argue that the unique combination of elements that make up the "mise en scène" should be protected, while others contend that it's too abstract to qualify for copyright protection.

Is this the term you were thinking of? If not, could you provide any additional context about where you heard the term or how it was used? That might help me identify the specific French copyright term you're trying to recall.
