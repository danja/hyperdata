 The French term commonly used in copyright law is likely "droit d'auteur," which translates to "author's rights" in English.

"Droit d'auteur" refers to the French system of copyright law, which differs somewhat from the Anglo-American copyright system. The French approach places a stronger emphasis on the moral rights of authors and creators, in addition to their economic rights.

Key aspects of "droit d'auteur" include:

1. Moral rights (droit moral): These are the non-economic rights of an author, such as the right to be identified as the creator of a work and the right to maintain the integrity of the work.

2. Economic rights: These are similar to those in other copyright systems, granting the author control over the reproduction, distribution, and adaptation of their work.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of "droit d'auteur" or its comparison to other copyright systems?
