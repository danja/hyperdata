 Certainly, there are a few other French terms that are sometimes used in copyright discussions. Here are some possibilities:

1. "Droit de suite": This refers to the artist's resale right. It gives visual artists the right to receive a percentage of the sale price each time their artwork is resold through an art market professional.

2. "Droit moral": While I mentioned this earlier as part of "droit d'auteur," it's also used on its own. It refers to the moral rights of an author, which are separate from economic rights and include the right of attribution and the right of integrity.

3. "Oeuvre": This simply means "work" in French, but it's sometimes used in English to refer to the complete body of an artist's work.

4. "Contrefa√ßon": This term is used to describe counterfeit or pirated works, essentially copyright infringement.

5. "Droit voisin" or "droits voisins": These are "neighboring rights" or related rights, which protect the rights of performers, producers, and broadcasters.

6. "Domaine public": While this translates directly to "public domain," it's sometimes used in its French form in international copyright discussions.

If none of these seem to fit what you're looking for, perhaps you could share more context about where you heard the term or how it was used? That might help narrow down the specific term you're trying to recall.
