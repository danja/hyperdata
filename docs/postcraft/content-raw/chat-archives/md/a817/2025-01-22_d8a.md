 I'll analyze all available processors and their configurations to create a complete Turtle vocabulary file.

<antThinking>This task requires creating a comprehensive RDF vocabulary that captures all terms used across the codebase. Since this will be a formal, reusable specification document, it qualifies as an artifact.</antThinking>
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isnâ€™t yet supported on mobile.

I've created a comprehensive RDF vocabulary that captures all processors and properties found in the codebase. The terms are organized by category (File System, Flow Control, JSON Processing, etc.) with full RDF typing and documentation.

Follow-up questions:

q1: Would you like me to add any axioms for property domains and ranges?

q2: Should I add any additional metadata about version compatibility or deprecation status?

q3: Would you like me to generate a class hierarchy visualization?

q4: Would you like to see sample usage patterns for specific processor combinations?
