Currently the message-passing is achieved using js events. In the near future we will need to explore other approaches, for example protocols like http and xmpp and different flow models, for example using a pull setup. But before going there, some refactoring is required. Transmission.js should focus on the model of the transmission, the process() method should somehow be abstracted out into a separate model. Likewise in the processors descended from Processor.js, the emit() call is fairly hard coded. Now first please think about how these parts can be decomposed, with separately defined common interfaces, with implementations following those APIs. After creating a structural model, please give me a step-by-step plan on how it may be achieved without breaking anything. The immediate goal is to refactor to facilitate future development, maintaing the current functionality. Please give your responses in complete, individual, separate artifacts.
