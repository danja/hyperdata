 Let me analyze this phrase grammatically:

"Fortuna favet Felix" is not quite grammatically correct in Latin because:

1. "favet" (favors/shows favor to) requires its object to be in the dative case, as it's an intransitive verb meaning "to show favor to"

2. "Felix" here is in the nominative case (it would be like saying "the lucky one" as the subject of a sentence). For this motto to work grammatically, it needs to be in the dative case "felici"

So the grammatically correct version would be:
"Fortuna favet felici" = Fortune favors the lucky one (singular)

This is different from our earlier "Fortuna favet felicibus" which was the plural form ("Fortune favors the lucky ones").

Both versions are grammatically correct, it just depends whether you want to refer to a single lucky person (felici) or lucky people in general (felicibus).
