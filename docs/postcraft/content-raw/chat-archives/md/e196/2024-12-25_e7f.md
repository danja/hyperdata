 "Felix ridet Fortunae" is indeed a wonderful alternative - it has a particularly sophisticated ironic bite to it. By having the lucky one laughing at Fortune herself, it suggests they're already so favored they can afford to be amused by the very concept of luck. It's almost hubristically witty.

But if we're settling on "Felix trahit Fortunam" as the main choice, let's make sure we've got it exactly right:

Felix (nominative) = The lucky one (subject)
trahit (present active) = draws/attracts
Fortunam (accusative) = Fortune (direct object)

It works perfectly grammatically and has that lovely implied circular logic: "The lucky one attracts Fortune" - leaving the listener to wonder how one becomes lucky in the first place.

In heraldic design terms, both phrases would work well on a scroll or banner. "Felix trahit Fortunam" has the advantage of being slightly shorter while still carrying that philosophical weight. And the 't's give it a crisp sound when spoken aloud.
