 To make "Felix" work as a nominative subject, we'd need to switch to a transitive verb where "Fortuna" becomes the object rather than the subject. However, the exact meaning would shift a bit.

We could say:
"Felix capit Fortunam" = The lucky one captures/seizes Fortune

Or:
"Felix ducit Fortunam" = The lucky one leads Fortune

These are grammatically correct with "Felix" as the subject, but they change the traditional relationship between Fortune and the fortunate person - now the lucky person is acting on Fortune rather than Fortune bestowing favor. This might actually make for an interesting and unusual motto, suggesting a more active relationship with luck rather than the traditional passive receiving of Fortune's favor.

These would be pretty unorthodox for heraldic mottos, which traditionally tend to show Fortune/fate/destiny as the active force. But that uniqueness might be appealing, depending on what you're looking for.
