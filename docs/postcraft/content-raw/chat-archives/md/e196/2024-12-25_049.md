 Ah, I understand now - you're looking for something that creates a sort of deliberate tautology or circular logic as a wry commentary on luck itself. That's quite clever!

In that case, I think having "Felix" as the subject would actually work perfectly for this ironic twist. We could say:

"Felix trahit Fortunam" = The lucky one draws/attracts Fortune

This has a nice philosophical implication - suggesting that being lucky is what makes you lucky, a playful subversion of "Fortuna favet fortibus" (Fortune favors the brave). Where the traditional motto suggests bravery as a path to fortune, this one suggests, somewhat humorously, that the only reliable predictor of luck is... luck itself.

It's both grammatically correct and carries that circular logic you're aiming for. The verb "trahit" (draws/attracts) works particularly well here as it suggests an almost magnetic relationship between being lucky and attracting more luck, while still maintaining the formal tone appropriate for a heraldic motto.

This version really captures that wry observation about the nature of luck that you're going for - it's both a proper Latin motto and a subtle joke about the self-fulfilling nature of fortune.
