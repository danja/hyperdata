 Let me help you with a Latin translation for your heraldic motto.

The most natural Latin translation would be "Fortuna favet fortunatis"

Breaking this down:
- Fortuna = Fortune/Luck (as a personified goddess)
- favet = favors/shows favor (present tense of favÄ“re)
- fortunatis = to the lucky/fortunate ones (dative plural)

This maintains the play on words between Fortune and fortunate/lucky that exists in the English version. It's worth noting that while this is a grammatically correct translation, I should mention that since this involves a somewhat rare Latin phrase, you may want to have a Latin scholar verify the translation to ensure it carries exactly the connotations you're looking for in a heraldic context.

Some similar traditional Latin mottos include "Fortuna favet fortibus" (Fortune favors the brave) and "Audentes fortuna iuvat" (Fortune aids the daring), which might also interest you for comparison.
