 I'll address all four follow-up questions about representation theory:

1. Character theory captures the "trace" or "shadow" of representations - like a fingerprint of how the object interacts. It's a simpler way to track the essential features of the representation, similar to how Yoneda lets us work with simpler, concrete versions of abstract concepts.

2. Cayley's theorem shows every group can be viewed as symmetries of a set - this is a concrete representation. It's a perfect example of the Yoneda philosophy: understand objects through their actions rather than their internal structure.

3. Irreducible representations are the "atomic" or fundamental ways an object can act - the basic building blocks. They're like the fundamental relationships in Yoneda's perspective that can't be broken down further.

4. Functors in this context are the "translation mechanisms" - they carry the representation structure between different settings while preserving the essential relationships, just as Yoneda functors preserve the web of relationships.

q1: How does this perspective help in studying modular representations?

q2: Can you explain the role of tensor products in this framework?

q3: How does this connect to representation stability theory?

q4: What's the relationship to representation varieties?
