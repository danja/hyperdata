 I have analyzed the requirements for a term describing cross-project interaction capabilities, identified key concepts in systems architecture and interoperability, and broken this down methodologically.

Task summaries:
1. Evaluated existing terminology in distributed systems
2. Considered semantic aspects of interaction capabilities
3. Analyzed potential terms from standards bodies
4. Assessed applicability across different contexts

Solution: The term "capability profile" is recommended. It precisely describes the interface, protocols, and methods through which one component can interact with others, while being sufficiently generic to apply across different technological contexts. This can be formalized using RDF to describe the specific capabilities of each component.

q1: How would capability profiles be represented in RDF Schema?
q2: What existing ontologies could be leveraged for describing capabilities?
q3: How do capability profiles relate to service discovery mechanisms?
q4: Could capability profiles be used for automated reasoning about system composition?
