 As an expert JavaScript programmer, I understand your request for developing a specialized vocabulary for project management that's both human and machine-comprehensible. Here's a high-level approach to capturing the concepts you've described:

1. Conceptual Dimensions:
   - Scope: zoomLevel (micro to macro)
   - Time: temporalFocus (immediate to long-term)
   - Detail: resolutionDepth (abstract to concrete)
   - Importance: priorityAmplitude (low to high)

2. Navigation Concepts:
   - zoomIn / zoomOut: Adjust scope of focus
   - panContext: Shift focus laterally within a dimension
   - amplifySignificance: Increase importance of an element
   - filterHarmonics: Focus on specific project aspects

3. Interaction Verbs:
   - tune: Adjust project parameters
   - compose: Create new project elements
   - orchestrate: Arrange and coordinate tasks
   - remix: Recombine project components

These terms draw from film, audio, and music production analogies while maintaining clarity for project management contexts.

Q1: How would you prioritize these conceptual dimensions for initial implementation?
Q2: What specific RDF/OWL properties would be most useful for expressing these concepts?
Q3: Can you think of any existing ontologies that might align well with these concepts?
