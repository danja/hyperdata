 Certainly, let's incorporate the focus analogy:

4. Focus Concepts:
   - sharpFocus: High detail on specific elements
   - softFocus: Reduced detail, emphasizing overall patterns
   - depthOfField: Range of elements in clear focus
   - bokeh: Intentional blurring of non-essential elements

These concepts from photography can be applied to project management:

- sharpFocus: Detailed analysis of specific tasks or components
- softFocus: Overview of project structure, losing individual details
- depthOfField: Range of tasks or timeframes under consideration
- bokeh: De-emphasizing less relevant project aspects

Q1: How might these focus concepts interact with the previously mentioned dimensions?
Q2: Can you envision specific use cases for the bokeh concept in project management?
Q3: How would you represent the transition between sharp and soft focus in a user interface?
