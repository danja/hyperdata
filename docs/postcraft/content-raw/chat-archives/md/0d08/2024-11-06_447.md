 Since we're exploring possible etymological connections, there is the Latin word "luna" (moon) and its diminutive form "lunula" which could be related. There's also "lugno" in some Italian dialects. However, since we're dealing with very specific etymological questions about an obscure term, I should note that I may be hallucinating these connections. The best approach would be to consult authoritative Latin and Italian etymological dictionaries to verify any potential connections. Would you like to explore any other possible linguistic connections?
