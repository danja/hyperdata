 From what I understand, "lugno" is an archaic or dialectical Italian variant of "luglio" meaning "July." However, since this is quite specialized linguistic information about a dialectical term, I should note that I may be hallucinating aspects of its usage or meaning. To be completely certain about this term's meaning and historical usage, you would want to consult Italian dialect dictionaries or historical language resources.
