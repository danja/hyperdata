 It appears you're encountering an issue where Python can't find the numpy module, even though you've installed it via the package manager in Termux. This discrepancy can occur for a few reasons. Let's try to resolve this:

1. First, make sure you're using the correct Python version:

   ```
   python --version
   ```

   Check if this matches the version for which numpy was installed.

2. Try installing numpy directly through pip:

   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```

3. If that doesn't work, you can try specifying the Python version:

   ```
   pip3 install numpy
   ```

4. Check your Python path:

   ```
   which python
   ```

   Ensure it's pointing to the Termux Python installation.

5. You can also try to locate where numpy is installed:

   ```
   pip show numpy
   ```

   This will show you the installation location.

6. If none of the above work, you might need to check your PYTHONPATH:

   ```
   echo $PYTHONPATH
   ```

   If it's empty or incorrect, you may need to set it to include the directory where numpy is installed.

7. As a last resort, you could try uninstalling and reinstalling both Python and numpy:

   ```
   pkg uninstall python numpy
   pkg install python numpy
   ```

After trying these steps, attempt to run your script again. If you're still encountering issues, please provide more information about your Termux setup and Python environment.

Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail?
