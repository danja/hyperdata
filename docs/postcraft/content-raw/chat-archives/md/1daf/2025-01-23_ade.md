Now please create three further artifacts to aid in creating an owl2 ontology to cover these concepts: one a requirements specification for what is likely to be needed in the ontology, with overview and a strategy for building it : next steps etc. the other a first pass at the ontology in turtle syntax; thirdly a hypothetical example of the ontology in use.  The ontology should be very highly structured with a layered hierarchy, general to specific, and capture relationships between the concepts.  It should feature rdfs:label and rdfs:summary for all terms.  The example can be that of an agent "Claudio" bookmarking a link "https://hyperdata.it" using a tool called "Squirt" which passes its data to a knowledge store called "Strandz".
Render the documents as complete individual artifacts.
