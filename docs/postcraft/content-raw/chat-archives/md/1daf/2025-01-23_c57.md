Useful list. But what I'm trying to get at is at a tangent. When I save a bookmark, I am expressing some kind of interest to the content at the target. There might also be some relation between that material and that of the previous link I bookmarked, or a piece of writing I did on the same day. That implicit knowledge is what I'm interested in. I want terms to describe, maybe to allow categorization, the kinds of knowledge there and the associated mechanisms. I think it will be useful to capture this kind of thing, which often slips through the net
