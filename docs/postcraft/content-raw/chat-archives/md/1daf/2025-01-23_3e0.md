Yes, that's it. Can you please create two documents, using those lists as a starting point: 1. expanding on the key concepts; 2. expanding on the theoretical frameworks. Maybe try to expand the scope slightly, to include maybe double the number of key points in each. Keep the text terse and formal using technical language as appropriate, but try and make the coverage comprehensive.  Make the docs very structured, cross-referencing between them as necessary (if you include placeholders in the markdown for anchors and link I can tweak to get them to resolve here) : for each element give label, short summary, longer description together with some context for how the element relates to other elements. Render the documents as 2 complete artifacts.
