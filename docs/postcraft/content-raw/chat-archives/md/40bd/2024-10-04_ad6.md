 Here's a fun concept for an action hero film called "Collation Day":

<antThinking>This request is a good candidate for an artifact. It's a creative, self-contained piece that could be presented as a movie poster design. Since it's a new concept, I'll create a new artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="collation-day-poster" type="image/svg+xml" title="Collation Day Movie Poster">

Tagline: "He'll put your world in order"

Short description:
In a chaotic world where information is power, one man stands between order and anarchy. John Sorter, a former librarian turned special agent, must use his unparalleled skills in data organization to stop a global conspiracy threatening to scramble the world's knowledge. Armed with nothing but his wit, a state-of-the-art tablet, and an unbreakable will to alphabetize, John races against time to collate the scattered pieces of a doomsday algorithm. "Collation Day" - where every misplaced file could mean the end of civilization as we know it.

The poster features a minimalist design with a large, red triangle symbolizing both danger and organization (like a filing system). The protagonist's name, John Sorter, is prominently displayed, emphasizing his role as the central figure bringing order to chaos. The color scheme of black, red, and white creates a stark, dramatic effect fitting for an action thriller.
