 Mermaid itself is a static diagram definition language - the rendered diagrams themselves aren't interactive. However, I can help you create several variations of the diagram to demonstrate what adding or removing nodes would look like.

Here are a few approaches people commonly use to achieve "interactive-like" experiences with Mermaid:

1. Using separate diagrams to show different states/views
2. Using click events in the diagram (though these only work in some environments)
3. Using tools/editors that provide a live preview as you edit the Mermaid code

Let me demonstrate what adding a new node and connection would look like:

<antArtifact identifier="messaging-patterns-modified" type="application/vnd.ant.mermaid" title="Messaging Patterns with New Node">
graph TB
    subgraph Point-to-Point
        P2P[Point-to-Point]
        SQ[Synchronous Queue]
        AQ[Asynchronous Queue]
        P2P --> SQ
        P2P --> AQ
    end

    subgraph Publish-Subscribe
        PS[Publish-Subscribe]
        T[Topic-Based]
        C[Content-Based]
        PS --> T
        PS --> C
        NEW[New Pattern] %% Added new node
        PS --> NEW %% Added new connection
    end

    subgraph Message Brokers
        MB[Message Broker]
        RMQ[Queue-Based]
        PB[Pub/Sub-Based]
        H[Hybrid]
        MB --> RMQ
        MB --> PB
        MB --> H
    end

    subgraph Event-Driven
        ED[Event-Driven]
        ES[Event Sourcing]
        CQRS[CQRS]
        EV[Event Bus]
        ED --> ES
        ED --> CQRS
        ED --> EV
    end

    subgraph Pull-Based
        PL[Pull-Based]
        LP[Long Polling]
        BC[Batch Consumer]
        CP[Cursor-Based Polling]
        PL --> LP
        PL --> BC
        PL --> CP
    end

    PL --> PS
    PL --> MB
    PL --> ED
</antArtifact>

If you want to achieve true interactivity, you would typically need to:
1. Use a JavaScript library that can manipulate the Mermaid source code
2. Re-render the diagram when changes are made
3. Build a UI around it to handle the interactions

There are some tools that provide this functionality, like the Mermaid Live Editor (https://mermaid.live/), which gives you a live preview as you edit the code. Would you like me to demonstrate any specific modifications to the diagram?
