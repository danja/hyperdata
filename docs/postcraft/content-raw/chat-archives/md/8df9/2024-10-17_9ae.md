 I have analyzed the problem and identified the key components. I've broken down the problem into steps and will now carry out each task.

1. Identified issue with path handling in CommandUtils.js
2. Compared bad run with good run
3. Located the source of the problem in path construction
4. Proposed a solution to fix the path handling

The issue lies in how the application path is being processed. When a full path is provided, it's not being correctly parsed, leading to an incorrect transmissionsDir. The solution involves modifying the path handling logic in CommandUtils.js to correctly process both relative and absolute paths.

q1: What specific changes are needed in CommandUtils.js?
q2: How can we ensure both relative and absolute paths work correctly?
q3: Are there any other parts of the code that might be affected by this change?
q4: How can we test the solution to ensure it works for all use cases?
