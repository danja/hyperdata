 To create an acronym or short composite term that broadens the concept of MVP beyond the business world and makes it more applicable to general research and development, while keeping in mind agile methodologies, I propose:

PIVOT

This stands for:

Prototype for Iterative Validation and Ongoing Testing

Let me break down why this term could work well:

1. Prototype: This emphasizes the experimental, preliminary nature of the creation, moving away from the "product" focus of MVP.

2. Iterative: This aligns with agile methodologies, emphasizing the cyclical nature of development and improvement.

3. Validation: This keeps the core idea of testing assumptions and hypotheses, which is crucial in both business and research contexts.

4. Ongoing: This suggests continuity and adaptability, reinforcing the idea that this is part of a larger process.

5. Testing: This broadens the concept beyond just customer feedback, encompassing various forms of evaluation and experimentation.

The word "pivot" itself is also relevant in agile and lean startup methodologies, referring to a fundamental change in approach based on learnings. This reinforces the idea of adaptability and responsiveness to new information.

As a term, PIVOT could be used to describe a milestone or subgoal within a larger project that represents a key point for testing core assumptions and gathering data to inform further development. It maintains the spirit of MVP while being more generally applicable to various fields of research and development.
