 This is a common scenario in web development, and there are a few ways to approach it. Webhooks are indeed one option, but let's explore the possibilities to find the best fit for your needs.

1. Webhooks:
Webhooks can certainly be used for this purpose. In this case, you'd set up an endpoint on your server that, when called via HTTPS, triggers the Node.js script. This is a good option if you want external services to be able to trigger your script.

2. Simple HTTP Endpoint:
If you don't need the full webhook functionality, you can create a simple HTTP endpoint in your Node.js application that, when accessed, runs your script. This is similar to a webhook but might be simpler to implement if you don't need features like authentication or payload processing.

3. Reverse Proxy with Nginx:
You can use Nginx as a reverse proxy to forward HTTPS requests to your Node.js application. This allows you to handle the HTTPS connection in Nginx (which is very efficient at this) and pass the request to your Node.js app.

Here's a basic approach combining options 2 and 3:

1. Create an endpoint in your Node.js application:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { exec } = require('child_process');
const app = express();

app.get('/run-script', (req, res) => {
  exec('node /path/to/your/script.js', (error, stdout, stderr) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
      return res.status(500).send('Error running script');
    }
    res.send('Script executed successfully');
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

2. Configure Nginx to proxy requests to your Node.js app:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    ssl_certificate /path/to/your/certificate.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /path/to/your/certificate.key;

    location /run-script {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

This setup allows you to make an HTTPS call to `https://your-domain.com/run-script`, which will trigger your Node.js script.

Remember to consider security implications:
- Add authentication to your endpoint to prevent unauthorized access.
- Use HTTPS to encrypt the communication.
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.

The best approach depends on your specific needs, but this method provides a straightforward way to trigger a script via an HTTPS call using Nginx and Node.js.
