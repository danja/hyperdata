 It seems the extractor unit tests failed, specifically at the assertion checking if the result includes the string "John Doe". Let's analyze the issue and propose some fixes.

1. The main problem appears to be that the extractor is creating blank nodes (_:b4) for literal values instead of using the actual literal value ("John Doe").

2. This issue is likely occurring in the RDFNodeCreator class, where it's not differentiating between different types of literals.

3. To fix this, we need to modify the createNode method in the RDFNodeCreator class to properly handle different types of nodes, especially literals.

Here's a suggested fix for the RDFNodeCreator class:

```javascript
class RDFNodeCreator {
    constructor(rdf) {
        this.rdf = rdf;
    }

    createNode(item) {
        console.log('Creating node for item:', item);
        if (item.type === 'LITERAL') {
            return this.rdf.literal(item.value);
        } else if (item.type === 'URI') {
            return this.rdf.namedNode(item.value);
        } else {
            return this.rdf.blankNode();
        }
    }
}
```

This modification ensures that literal values are properly created as RDF literals, URIs as named nodes, and everything else as blank nodes.

After making this change, run the tests again to see if the issue is resolved.

Q1: Should we add more specific handling for different literal subtypes (e.g., integers, dates)?
Q2: How can we improve the logging to make debugging easier in the future?
Q3: Are there any other parts of the code that might be affected by this change?
Q4: Should we add more comprehensive tests to cover different node types and edge cases?
