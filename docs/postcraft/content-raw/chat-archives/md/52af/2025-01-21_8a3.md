# [Refactor Processor.js to support multiple property values](https://claude.ai/chat/52af9782-61a5-4d1e-9ffc-45d15c0a3a04)

 Let me analyze the existing code and design a systematic approach for implementing the requested changes.

<antThinking>After reviewing the project knowledge, I'll need to create comprehensive test and implementation artifacts. This is a significant refactoring that warrants full file listings in artifacts.</antThinking>

Key observations:
1. `getProperty()` currently returns only first/single value
2. `ProcessorSettings.js` exists but isn't fully utilized 
3. Grapoi queries are used for RDF graph traversal
4. Test coverage needed for both single and multiple values

Required steps:

1. Create unit tests for ProcessorSettings
2. Move property retrieval logic to ProcessorSettings
3. Add getValues() implementation 
4. Update Processor to delegate to ProcessorSettings
5. Modify StringFilter to handle both patterns
6. Add integration tests for new functionality

Let's start with the test file for ProcessorSettings:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



Now let's implement the updated ProcessorSettings class:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



Now let's update the Processor class to delegate to ProcessorSettings:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



Next steps should include:
1. Update StringFilter to handle both single and multiple patterns
2. Create integration tests for new pattern handling
3. Update other processors that use getProperty() 
4. Add documentation for the new functionality

Follow-up questions:

q1: Would you like me to proceed with updating StringFilter next?

q2: Should we add Typescript type definitions for the new functionality?

q3: Would you like me to create additional test cases for error conditions?

q4: Should we create a migration guide for updating existing processors?
