 Based on my knowledge up to 2022, here are the key parts of manim:

1. Scene: The fundamental unit of a manim animation, containing all objects and animations.

2. Mobjects (Mathematical Objects): Basic elements like shapes, text, graphs, etc.

3. Animations: Methods to transform or move Mobjects.

4. Camera: Controls what's visible in the scene.

5. Coordinate Systems: For positioning objects in 2D or 3D space.

6. Configuration: Settings for rendering, quality, and output format.

7. Command Line Interface: For running animations and setting parameters.

8. Inheritance System: Allows creation of custom objects and animations.

Q1: Are you interested in a specific feature or capability of manim?

Q2: Do you need help understanding how these components interact in a typical manim project?

Q3: Would you like to see a simple code example demonstrating these key parts?
