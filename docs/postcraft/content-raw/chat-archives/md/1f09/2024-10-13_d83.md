 Interesting twist! Let's explore this role reversal where the AI systems are guiding or influencing the human knowledge worker. This approach could lead to some thought-provoking and slightly unsettling job titles that reflect the complex relationship between humans and AI.

<antThinking>We're now looking at a reversal of the typical human-AI dynamic. The goal is to create terms that suggest the AI is guiding or controlling the human worker, while still maintaining a connection to the original concept of managing intelligent agents. This could lead to some provocative and humorous titles.</antThinking>

Here are some ideas that play with this role reversal:

1. AI-Steered Analyst
2. Algo-Guided Operative
3. Machine-Led Mediator
4. Synthetic Overseer's Assistant
5. Neural Network Navigator
6. Cybernetic Marionette
7. AI-Driven Facilitator
8. Robo-Wrangled Specialist
9. Quantum-Puppeteered Agent
10. Silicon-Shepherded Expert
11. Bot-Bridled Coordinator
12. Data-Directed Liaison
13. Synth-Symbiote Operator
14. AI-Tethered Technician
15. Neuro-Nudged Facilitator

Let's examine a few of these more closely:

1. Cybernetic Marionette:
   - Implies the worker is 'puppeteered' by AI systems
   - Maintains the cybernetic connection
   - Has a slightly unsettling but intriguing connotation

2. AI-Driven Facilitator:
   - Suggests the human is facilitating processes, but under AI guidance
   - More neutral tone while still conveying the role reversal
   - Maintains a professional sound

3. Synth-Symbiote Operator:
   - Implies a symbiotic relationship, but with the synthetic intelligence as the dominant partner
   - Suggests a deep, almost biological connection between human and AI
   - Has a strong sci-fi feel

4. Neuro-Nudged Facilitator:
   - Implies subtle guidance from neural networks
   - "Nudged" suggests a gentler form of AI influence
   - Maintains the worker's agency while acknowledging AI direction

These terms aim to capture the essence of a knowledge worker who is, to varying degrees, guided or influenced by AI systems. They suggest a complex relationship where the traditional roles of human overseer and AI tool are blurred or reversed.

Do any of these resonate with the role reversal concept you had in mind? Or perhaps they inspire a direction you'd like to explore further?
