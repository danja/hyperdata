I'd like a new term that could be used as a job title. I'd like it to to sound a little futuristic. Cybernetics has this sound, and might be near what's needed with the greek root of helmsman. It will describe a software developer who designs intelligent agents, machine learning and ai subsystems like llms, builds environments for them and guides their behaviour, as well as having a role in their purposeful deployment. A real-world analogy might be a sheep farmer who creates an ecosystem in which the sheep can thrive, cares for thrm on every level,  controls their breeding and manages the needs to shear them for wool. And most significantly herds the sheep, pointing them in the right direction. The term should be reasonable short, like 'shepherd'.
