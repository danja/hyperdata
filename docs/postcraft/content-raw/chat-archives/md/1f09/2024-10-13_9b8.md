 You're very welcome! I'm glad we were able to explore the concept and etymology of "symbiotronic" in a way that met your needs. The journey from discussing AI management roles to landing on "Symbiotronic Engineer" and then delving into its linguistic roots was quite interesting.

This term, "Symbiotronic Engineer," nicely encapsulates the idea of someone working at the intersection of symbiotic relationships and advanced technology, particularly in the context of human-AI integration. It's a forward-looking title that suggests expertise in creating mutually beneficial connections between biological and artificial systems.

If you have any more questions about this concept or if you'd like to explore any related ideas further, please don't hesitate to ask. Good luck with your use of this term!
