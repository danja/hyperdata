 Certainly, I understand the need for a term that sounds good when spoken. Let's explore some more options, drawing from Greek and Latin roots where appropriate. Here are 10 new suggestions:

1. Noomancer (from Greek "noos" meaning mind, and "-mancer" suggesting mastery or control)

2. Syntelligist (from Greek "syn-" meaning together, and "intelligist" as a play on intelligence)

3. Cognos Auriga (Latin, roughly translating to "mind charioteer")

4. Technopastor (combining "techno-" with the Latin "pastor" for shepherd)

5. Aethernaut (play on "astronaut", suggesting navigation of the digital/AI realm)

6. Datathurge (from "data" and Greek "thourgos" meaning creator)

7. Algomind Curator (combining "algorithm" and "mind")

8. Synaptic Steward (referring to the neural network-like nature of AI)

9. Noetic Engineer (from Greek "noÄ“tikos" relating to mental activity)

10. Cybernetic Cultivator (alliterative term emphasizing nurturing aspect)

Among these, "Noomancer" stands out as particularly smooth to pronounce while capturing the essence of the role. It suggests a person who has mastery over artificial minds or intelligence.

"Syntelligist" is another option that rolls off the tongue well and implies working with or bringing together different forms of intelligence.

"Aethernaut" might appeal if you want to emphasize the exploratory and navigational aspects of the role in the digital realm.

Do any of these resonate with you? Or perhaps they spark ideas for further refinement?
