 Interesting request! Let's brainstorm a futuristic job title for this role. We're looking for a term that encapsulates the idea of guiding and nurturing AI systems, similar to how a shepherd cares for and directs their flock. Here are a few possibilities:

1. Noosphere Navigator
2. AI Ecologist
3. Cognitech Helmsman
4. Synthint Cultivator
5. Cyberpherd

Let's break down "Cyberpherd" as it seems to fit your requirements best:

- It's a portmanteau of "cyber" (relating to computers and AI) and "shepherd" (the analogy you provided).
- It's relatively short and easy to pronounce.
- It has a futuristic sound while still being understandable.
- It captures the essence of guiding and nurturing AI systems.

"Cyberpherd" evokes the image of someone who tends to a flock of digital entities, guiding their development and behavior. It implies both technical expertise in AI and a holistic approach to managing these systems.

This term could be used in various contexts:

- Job listing: "Seeking experienced Cyberpherd to oversee our AI ecosystem"
- Business card: "Jane Doe, Senior Cyberpherd at TechFuture Inc."
- Project description: "Our team of Cyberpherds ensures ethical AI development and deployment"

What do you think of "Cyberpherd"? Does it capture the essence of the role you're envisioning? If you'd like to explore more options or refine this one further, I'd be happy to help.
