 Understood. You're looking for something that sounds good, captures the shepherding aspect, but avoids religious overtones. Let's explore 20 more options, focusing on the guiding and nurturing aspects of AI development:

1. Noopoimenist (blending "noo-" for mind and Greek "poimÄ“n")
2. Syntelliherd (combining "syntelligist" with "herd")
3. Algoguide
4. Cybernomad (implying guidance through digital realms)
5. Technodrover (from "drover", a person who drives cattle)
6. Cogniherd
7. Datashepherd
8. Neuroflock Steward
9. Digimentor
10. AI Wrangler
11. Cybertrail Guide
12. Datapasturalist
13. Synthflock Navigator
14. Bitwise Drover
15. Quantum Herdsman
16. Neuroscape Ranger
17. AI Ecosystemist
18. Cognipath Guide
19. Silicoherd (silicon + herd)
20. Technomadic Cultivator

Among these, a few stand out for their balance of futuristic sound and shepherding connotations:

- "Noopoimenist" combines the concept of mind/intelligence with the Greek word for shepherd, though it might be a bit challenging to pronounce.
- "Syntelliherd" builds on your liked "syntelligist" while incorporating the herding aspect.
- "AI Wrangler" is more casual but captures the essence of guiding and managing AI systems.
- "Neuroscape Ranger" suggests navigation and management of complex neural network landscapes.

These options aim to capture the nurturing, guiding, and ecosystem-management aspects of the role without religious implications. Do any of these resonate with you, or perhaps spark ideas for further refinement?
