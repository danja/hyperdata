 Excellent! "Symbio" indeed offers a rich vein to explore, suggesting a mutually beneficial relationship between human and AI. Let's delve into more possibilities using this concept:

<antThinking>We're focusing on the symbiosis concept, which implies a close, mutually beneficial relationship between the human worker and AI systems. This aligns well with the idea of managing intelligent agents while also suggesting a deep integration or interdependence.</antThinking>

Here are some ideas revolving around the symbiosis concept:

1. Technosymbiont
2. AI Symbionaute
3. Cybersymbiotic Engineer
4. Synthelligence Symbiost
5. Neurosymbiosis Specialist
6. Datasymbiot
7. Quantum Symbiotic Operator
8. Algosymbiont Coordinator
9. Symbiointelligence Manager
10. Cognosymbiotic Facilitator
11. Symbiotronic Engineer
12. Neurosynergist (implying symbiotic synergy)
13. Symbiomind Cultivator
14. AI Symbioticist
15. Datasymbiogenesis Expert

Let's examine a few of these more closely:

1. Technosymbiont:
   - Combines "techno" (technology) with "symbiont"
   - Implies a mutually beneficial relationship with technology/AI
   - Sounds scientific and futuristic

2. AI Symbionaute:
   - Blends "AI," "symbio," and a play on "naut" (traveler)
   - Suggests someone who navigates a symbiotic relationship with AI
   - Has an exploratory, adventurous connotation

3. Synthelligence Symbiost:
   - Combines "synthetic intelligence" with "symbiost"
   - Implies a specialist in symbiotic relationships with artificial intelligences
   - Has a strong sci-fi feel while maintaining scientific credibility

4. Symbiomind Cultivator:
   - Suggests nurturing a symbiotic relationship between human and artificial minds
   - Retains the cultivation aspect from earlier iterations
   - Implies active development and care of the human-AI relationship

These terms capture the essence of a deep, mutually beneficial relationship between the human worker and AI systems. They suggest someone who not only manages intelligent agents but also forms a symbiotic bond with them, potentially blurring the lines between overseer and partner.

Do any of these symbiosis-based terms align with your vision? Or perhaps they spark ideas for further refinement or exploration?
