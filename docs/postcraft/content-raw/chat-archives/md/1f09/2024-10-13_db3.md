 Certainly! Let's explore some options incorporating "farmer" or its synonyms, along with some neologisms derived from Greek or Latin roots:

<antThinking>The user wants more options specifically including "farmer" or related terms, including neologisms from Greek or Latin. I'll focus on creating terms that blend the concept of farming/cultivation with AI and intelligence, keeping in mind the user's appreciation for "intelligist" and humorous yet accurate analogies.</antThinking>

1. AI Agronom (from Greek "agros" for field)
2. Datacultor (play on "cultivator")
3. Cognifarmer
4. Synthtelligence Agrarian
5. Nooculturist (from Greek "noos" for mind)
6. Cybernetic Colonus (Latin "colonus" for farmer)
7. Intellifarm Steward
8. Algo-agriculturist
9. Dataponic Cultivator (play on "hydroponic")
10. Neural Husbandman
11. Technopeasant (a humorous take)
12. Silico-agronomist
13. Synapse Sower
14. Cybernetic Yeoman
15. AI Cropmaster

Among these, a few stand out for their blend of accuracy, humor, and linguistic intrigue:

- "AI Agronom" combines the futuristic "AI" with the Greek-derived "agronom," suggesting someone who manages the 'fields' of artificial intelligence.

- "Datacultor" is a neat portmanteau that implies cultivation of data and AI, while sounding professional and slightly playful.

- "Nooculturist" has a nice ring to it, blending the concept of mind cultivation with a futuristic sound.

- "Synthtelligence Agrarian" is longer but comprehensively captures the idea of farming synthetic intelligences.

- "Technopeasant" offers a humorous juxtaposition of high-tech work with a traditional farming term, similar to the "plumber" analogy for network engineers.

Do any of these align closer with what you're envisioning? Or perhaps they spark ideas for further refinement?
