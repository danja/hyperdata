I want to create my own logger called 'logi', primarily for node but browser support would be desirable too. It should be usable in development and production. To help me, please follow these hierarchical steps, complete A steps 1, 2, 3...  before moving to B 1, w, 3 etc  : 
A. Goal : identify requirements, best practices and current approaches
1. Identify the five most popular logging libraries for node and/or browser js
2. For each, note their key features and any architectural patterns used, together with any notable features of implementation
3. Compile these characteristics into a single set of requirements and design concepts for an ideal logger. Note this.
B. 
1. Examine the current code of transmissions in the project knowledge files to see how logging is currently used and implemented
2. Describe how logi, the ideal logger for transmissions, might be implemented
