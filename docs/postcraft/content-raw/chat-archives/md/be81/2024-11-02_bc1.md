I'm looking for terms to add to a vocabulary for a particular software development methodology, loosely based around agile techniques, and which will ultimately become part of the prj project ontology. So far I have 'spike', to refer to a  short-lived exploratory subproject, 'pivot' to represent a landmark, pseudo-deadline kind of requirements spec. Those are both discrete points, by analogy like impulses in signals. I'd like a definition for 'wave', something that captures a continuous process. A nearby word would be 'flow' as used in the psychological sense, but that word is too overloaded, 'wave' can be new. It must make sense in the context of day-to-day project development.  The temporal aspect is significant, but there is also what might be called knowledge space. Can you think in this conceptual zone, give me short descriptions of these terms that would be consistent with, and clearly  differentiate each other. Also any other terms you think might fit, and your general thoughts, please.
