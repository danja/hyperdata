 Let me think about analogous concepts from signal processing and synthesis that might better capture these development flow concepts.

For 'Current' (representing established workflow patterns), some signal/synthesis terms to consider:

1. "Carrier" - like a carrier wave in signal processing, it's the fundamental pattern that carries other modulations. This could well capture the idea of the base workflow that supports other development activities.

2. "Baseline" - while used in many fields, in signal processing it represents the reference level. However, this might be too static to capture the flow aspect.

3. "Resonance" - this could nicely capture how a team finds its natural working frequency/pattern, like a resonant circuit finding its optimal frequency.

For 'Undertow' (representing hidden forces working against progress), possible alternatives:

1. "Noise Floor" - in audio/signal processing, this represents the accumulated unwanted signals that limit clarity. This very nicely maps to technical debt and hidden challenges.

2. "Distortion" - represents unwanted modification of a signal. However, might be too negative/extreme for what we want to convey.

3. "Damping" - from both signal processing and physics, represents forces that reduce oscillation/movement over time. This could be a very good fit as it's more neutral than "undertow" while still capturing the slowing effect.

4. "Attenuation" - gradual loss of signal strength over distance/time. Similar to damping but more specific to signal processing.

I think "Carrier" and "Noise Floor" might be the strongest candidates:

- "Carrier" better captures the idea of established process as something that actively supports and enables other work, rather than just being a flow. It suggests both stability and purpose.

- "Noise Floor" more precisely describes the accumulation of small issues that collectively impact performance, without the slightly threatening connotations of "undertow". It's also more technically accurate in terms of how these issues manifest.

Both terms would fit naturally in the existing ontological framework while providing more precise technical metaphors. They also maintain the wave/signal theme but shift it from water to electromagnetic/audio waves, which might actually be more appropriate for software development processes.

Would you like me to:
1. Revise the ontology with these alternative terms?
2. Explore more signal processing concepts that might be relevant?
3. Consider how these terms might relate differently to existing ontologies?
