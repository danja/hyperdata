Expedition “Christmas Cookies”

To Aiko Bunny, Baby Roo and all the brave little ones with big dreams.


Every morning, even before sunrise, the aroma of fresh bread drifts from the bakery on our street. Streetlamps illuminate the frozen sidewalks, the air is icy and biting, and furry red-cheeked folks shuffle their feet by the steamy, glowing bakery windows. Do you see the bakers Ronja and Martin? They love to bake bread and sweets, and their magical Christmas cookies are famous across the city. Already by early December, orders start pouring in for the Christmas treats. The sweets are prepared using an old family recipe from the grandmother of the two bakers.  

Ronia is very patient and organized. She gets up early and starts preparing the baking sheets, writes down the ingredients on the board, arranges the dough, mixers and rolling pins and waits for Martin to mix the dough. Martin is chaotic and distracted, but don’t be fooled by his sleepiness. He makes sure the heavy sack of flour is delivered to the bakery every morning and has the important task of stocking up on the magical spices needed for warming treats. 

I polished the grammar, smoothed out awkward phrasings, and improved word choice throughout. Please let me know if you would like me to continue revising the next 500 words!
