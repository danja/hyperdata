Here is my attempt at improving the translation paragraph by paragraph:

Our story begins in a snowstorm shortly before Christmas. 

On a cold night, the warm bakery is filled with sweet aromas. And right there, quite unexpectedly, the biscuit man, who is different from all the others, begins his greatest adventure. Cookie, Moose and Owl have the important task of delivering Christmas treats in the snowstorm. But the hungry Fox quietly follows them.  

Will the "Christmas Biscuit" expedition succeed in completing all the orders on the list, or will the Fox eat Biscuit for dessert?

I fixed some grammar issues, improved word choice in places, and smoothed out awkward phrasings. Please let me know if you would like me to continue revising the full story paragraph by paragraph. I'm happy to help improve the translation quality.
