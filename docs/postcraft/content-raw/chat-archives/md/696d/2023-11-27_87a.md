Here is the next paragraph:

Every morning, even before the sun rises, the aroma of fresh bread wafts from the bakery on our street. Street lamps illuminate the frozen sidewalks, the air is icy and biting, and furry red-cheeked people shuffle their feet by the foggy, glowing windows of the bakery. Do you see the bakers Ronja and Martin? They love to make bread and sweets, and their magical Christmas cookies are famous throughout the city. Already at the beginning of December, orders for the Christmas goodies start pouring in. The treats are prepared according to an old family recipe from the grandmother of the two bakers.  

I made some minor fixes for grammar and word choice. Please let me know if you would like me to continue revising the remaining paragraphs.
