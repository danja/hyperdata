 Considering the playful and specific nature of your sentence, we might want a word that's more unique or whimsical than "festival". Here are some alternatives that could fit well:

1. Recently I've been drawn to my desk like a moth to a market stall selling moth ear muffs at the Michaelmas Moth Muff Bazaar.

2. Recently I've been drawn to my desk like a moth to a market stall selling moth ear muffs at the Michaelmas Moth Muff Emporium.

3. Recently I've been drawn to my desk like a moth to a market stall selling moth ear muffs at the Michaelmas Moth Muff Faire.

4. Recently I've been drawn to my desk like a moth to a market stall selling moth ear muffs at the Michaelmas Moth Muff Jamboree.

5. Recently I've been drawn to my desk like a moth to a market stall selling moth ear muffs at the Michaelmas Moth Muff Extravaganza.

Of these, I particularly like "Bazaar" or "Emporium" as they maintain the whimsical tone while suggesting a gathering of merchants or a grand marketplace, which fits well with the idea of a market stall. "Faire" (with the old-fashioned spelling) also works nicely, giving a slightly medieval feel that pairs well with Michaelmas.
