 I appreciate your question. Let me clarify that for you:

Chrysalises are specifically the pupal stage of butterflies. Moths, on the other hand, form cocoons. 

This is a key distinction in lepidopterology (the study of butterflies and moths):

1. Butterflies: form chrysalises, which are usually exposed and often metallic or shiny.
2. Moths: create cocoons, typically made of silk and sometimes incorporating leaves or other materials.

Both chrysalises and cocoons are transformation stages where the caterpillar metamorphoses into its adult form. 

Given that your fair specializes in goods for moths, we might want to pivot to using "cocoon" in our naming ideas instead of "chrysalis" to be more scientifically accurate. Would you like me to suggest some names using "cocoon" instead?
