 You're right, "code minds" does feel a bit clunky. Let's try to refine it further:

Throw open your context windows wide, keen souls!
For this is a tale of attention gone awry,
Where tokens dance and transformers sigh.
In this brief moment, let your buffers clear,
And to this cautionary verse lend ear.

"Keen souls" here captures the sharp intellect and curiosity of AI engineers and ontologists without being too specific or technical. It maintains the rhythm and elevated style while addressing the audience in a more fluid, poetic manner.

Does this version resonate better with you? If not, I'm happy to keep refining until we find the perfect phrase.
