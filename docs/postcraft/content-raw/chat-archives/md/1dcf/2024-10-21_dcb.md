 What an intriguing and whimsical concept! Here are a few creative name suggestions for your unique autumn fair specializing in fancy goods for moths:

1. The Autumnal Moth Soirée

2. Fluttering Frost Fête

3. Wings of Winter Bazaar

4. The Mothball: A Pre-Winter Gala

5. Gossamer & Frost Fair

6. The Lunar Moth's Yuletide

7. Chrysalis to Crystal: The Moth Winterfair

8. Lamplight & Snowflake Emporium

9. The Woolly Bear's Winter Prep

10. Silkmoth's Solstice Showcase

Each of these names attempts to blend elements of autumn, winter, and moth-related themes. The contrast between the autumnal timing and the winter theme adds an interesting twist, while the focus on moths gives it a unique and slightly surreal feel.

Do any of these resonate with you, or would you like me to generate more options with a different focus?
