 Yes, there is a well-known brand of beer that you might find at Oktoberfest that begins with the letter P:

Paulaner

Paulaner is one of the six breweries that are permitted to serve beer at the Munich Oktoberfest. It's a major German brewery, founded in 1634 in Munich, and is particularly famous for its Oktoberfest beer.

Other notable Oktoberfest beers don't start with P, but include:

- Augustiner
- Hacker-Pschorr
- Hofbräu
- Löwenbräu
- Spaten

While Paulaner is the only P-starting major brand officially served at Munich's Oktoberfest, you might find other P-starting beers at Oktoberfest-style celebrations elsewhere, such as Pilsner Urquell (Czech) or various craft Pilsners. However, these aren't traditional Munich Oktoberfest beers.
