 Your instinct to tighten the verse is good. Let's see if we can refine it further for better scansion:

Throw open your context windows wide, keen souls!
For this is a tale of attention astray.
In this brief moment, let your buffers clear,
And to this cautionary verse give ear.

Here are the tweaks and their reasoning:
1. Changed "gone awry" to "astray" to maintain the rhythm while shortening the line.
2. Replaced "lend ear" with "give ear" for a more archaic feel that fits the Shakespearean style.

These small changes help the lines flow more evenly and maintain a consistent meter. The rhyme scheme (ABCB) is preserved, and each line now has a more similar syllable count, improving the overall rhythm.

Does this version feel more polished to you? If you'd like any further adjustments, please let me know.
