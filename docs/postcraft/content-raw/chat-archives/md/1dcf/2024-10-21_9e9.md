 The plural of proboscis is proboscises.

There's also a less common plural form "proboscides" (pronounced pruh-BOS-uh-deez), which comes directly from the Latin plural. However, "proboscises" is more widely used and recognized in modern English.

So if you were referring to multiple moth mouthparts, you could say:

"The Michaelmas Moth Muff & Proboscises Fair"

Or if you wanted to use the rarer form for a more exotic flair:

"The Michaelmas Moth Muff & Proboscides Fair"

Both would be correct, with "proboscises" being the more standard choice.
