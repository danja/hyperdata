# [Ontology for Bridging Declarative and Procedural Knowledge](https://claude.ai/chat/b53a3a20-eb5f-47b5-a727-da40c3188c90)

 Analyzing this knowledge representation challenge through the lens of transmissions:

Key observations:
- Processors represent atomic-ish units of transformation
- The scale aligns with LLM context capabilities
- Need to bridge declarative and procedural knowledge domains

Relevant prior art:
- DOLCE ontology's concept of endurants vs perdurants
- OWL-S process model for semantic web services
- Frame-based knowledge representation (Minsky)
- Flow-based programming patterns

Potential unified model structure:

```turtle
@prefix ko: <http://purl.org/stuff/knowledge/> .

ko:KnowledgeAspect
  a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:subClassOf [
    a owl:Class ;
    owl:oneOf (
      ko:Declarative 
      ko:Procedural
      ko:Embodied
      ko:Communicative
    )
  ] .

ko:TransformationUnit
  rdfs:subClassOf ko:ProcessingElement ;
  ko:hasAspect ko:Procedural ;
  ko:granularity "LLM-context" .
```

Questions:
q1: Should we model knowledge flow patterns similar to transmissions pipelines?
q2: How to represent the relationship between declarative models and their procedural implementations?
q3: Could embodied aspects be modeled as specialized processors with physical constraints?
q4: What role do events/messages play in bridging these knowledge dimensions?
