I'd like to use some of the conceptual construction of transmissions as a basis for an ontology to use in the context of knowledge representation. It should have aspects, facets or dimensions (term needed) that differentiate between declarative knowledge (exemplified by hierarchies of classes and properties and instance data) and computational knowledge, in the sense of information transformation and reasoning (what we find in most software), embodiment, in the domain of sensors and actuators, and communication, as the transfer of knowledge. As a starting point, consider the Processor class and its implementations. While not atomic in a strict sense, they do wrap up a kind of unit of processing. This unit happens to be around the optimum scale for working within an llms context window. Please consider the other 'dimensions' from a similar perspective, see if you can find any coherent way such thing may be described. Check prior art in modeling such things, then brainstorm, see if any approaches may offer some kind of unified view.
