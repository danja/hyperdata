 Here's a polemic on conceptual path dependency in knowledge representation:

Our models of knowledge and cognition remain trapped by historical metaphors - clockwork minds, computer processing, neural networks. Even 'emergence' is typically viewed through reductionist lenses inherited from physics and biology.

Modern AI developments reinforce these limitations. LLMs process knowledge as statistical patterns in text, reproducing and amplifying existing conceptual frameworks. The 'scaling hypothesis' itself follows a simplistic more-is-better trajectory.

What we lack is a fundamentally new vocabulary for true collective intelligence. Ant colonies don't scale up mouse behavior - they exhibit qualitatively different organizational principles. Similarly, human/AI knowledge societies may require entirely novel conceptual frameworks rather than scaled-up individual cognition models.

q1: How might we detect when our conceptual models are constrained by historical analogies?

q2: What phenomena in collective intelligence have no individual-level analogue?

q3: Could we develop metaphors based on emergence itself rather than lower-level mechanisms?

q4: How do we avoid having this discussion itself be trapped in old thought patterns?
