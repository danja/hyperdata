 Analyzing the questions to find fresh approaches:

q1: Pattern recognition in how we frame problems might come from emergence itself - watch for recurring "comfortable" analogies as warning signs. Are we really seeing clockwork/computation/neural patterns everywhere, or just defaulting to familiar models?

q2: Collective phenomena without individual analogues:
- Language evolution
- Market price discovery
- Cultural meme propagation 
- Scientific paradigm shifts
These arise only through interaction, can't be reduced to individual behaviors.

q3: New metaphors from emergence could include:
- Phase changes (water->steam isn't "scaled up" water)
- Crystallization patterns
- Strange attractors
But we must avoid falling into the trap of just using these mechanistically.

q4: This discussion seems trapped in academic analysis patterns. Perhaps we need:
- New forms of representation beyond text/logic
- Direct observation of emergence rather than modeling it
- Accepting irreducibility rather than seeking mechanisms
- Focus on enabling conditions rather than causal chains

The core challenge appears to be: how do we think about what we can't think about using our existing thought patterns?
