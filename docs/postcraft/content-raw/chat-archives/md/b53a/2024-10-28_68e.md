 Reviewing relevant prior art for unified knowledge models in agent societies:

Key frameworks:
- NKRL (Narrative Knowledge Representation Language) - bridges static/dynamic knowledge
- BDI (Belief-Desire-Intention) agent architecture 
- Activity Theory - mediated action perspective
- Enactivist cognitive models - knowledge through interaction

Common patterns emerging:
- Mediation between internal models and external manifestation
- Knowledge transformation through interaction
- Social construction of shared understanding
- Protocol-based communication patterns

q1: Could transmissions-style pipelines model agent internal knowledge processing pipelines AND inter-agent communication protocols?

q2: How to represent knowledge state changes as agents interact with environment/other agents?

q3: What role could shared ontologies play as coordination mechanisms between autonomous agents?

q4: How to model emergent knowledge from agent interactions while preserving individual agent perspectives?
