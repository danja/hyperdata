There is an issue with the mount points used by Docker for Fuseki, relevant log below. What I would like is for Fuseki to have a single mount point, with everything else in subdirectories below. I think this might fix the problem. I would like the database storage to all be under `fuseki/stores` . There should be three datasets persistent between Docker runs, `ds` , `semem` , `test-db`as well as one in-memory `test-mem` 
The current `config/fuseki/config.ttl` is close, but it looks like the Docker config is the main problem. Please create a revised version as well as `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` if necessary as individual artifacts containing full source code.
