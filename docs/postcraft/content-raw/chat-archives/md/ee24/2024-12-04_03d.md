# [Ontology for Implementation Types and Completion Criteria](https://claude.ai/chat/ee24375b-76b1-413f-bfda-23613830a5dc)

 I will explore expressing feature requirements and optionality patterns.

Task summaries:
1. Mapped feature requirements as class expressions using owl:Restriction
2. Used n3 rules for capturing state transitions and conditions
3. Created pattern for optional features using qualified cardinality restrictions
4. Structured properties to work consistently across rule systems

Solution:
Express core feature requirements through OWL class expressions while using N3/SWRL rules for dynamic state validation. Features are modeled with hasRequiredFeature and hasOptionalFeature object properties, with cardinality restrictions defining minimums. Rules capture completion logic independently of rule language.

q1: Would a hybrid of OWL DL restrictions and rules be maintainable?
q2: How can feature dependencies be expressed in N3?
q3: Should optionality be on the feature or requirement level?
q4: What rule patterns would work across both N3 and SWRL?
