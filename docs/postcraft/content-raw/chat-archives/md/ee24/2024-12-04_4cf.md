Please start with brainstorming the following and then try to formulate it as concrete deliverables, why we can move onto after. In the project ontology it would be useful to have terms relating to implementation types such as "minimum viable product", "proof of concept", "complete version". There is overlap between these, I don't know how to juggle things being broadly applicable but with clear distinctions. There should be some form of tie-in to the existing notions of goals and tasks. After you have considered that, please think about how we'd add a means of expressing criteria for completion, like a kind of constraint problem. Maybe shacl could help?
