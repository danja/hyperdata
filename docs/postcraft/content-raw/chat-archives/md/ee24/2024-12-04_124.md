 Yes, using OWL classes makes good sense. Let me expand on a more comprehensive solution.

Task summaries:
1. Defined ImplementationType as owl:Class with subclasses ProofOfConcept, MinimumViableProduct, CompleteVersion
2. Added transitive property evolvesTo to represent maturity progression
3. Created object properties hasMaturityLevel and requiresFeature 
4. Defined union class DeliverableFeature to capture required capabilities

Solution:
Define implementation types as an OWL class hierarchy allowing reasoner to infer type relationships. Features are modeled as classes that can be composed to define requirements. Maturity levels are represented as ordered instances of MaturityLevel class with explicit evolution paths defined through properties.

q1: How can circular evolution patterns be prevented in the ontology?
q2: Should feature requirements be defined through object properties or class expressions?
q3: Would SWRL rules help capture complex maturity conditions?
q4: How can we represent optional vs required features for each type?
