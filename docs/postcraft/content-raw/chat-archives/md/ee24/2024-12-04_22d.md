# [Ontology for Implementation Types and Completion Criteria](https://claude.ai/chat/ee24375b-76b1-413f-bfda-23613830a5dc)

 I have analyzed the key concepts around implementation types and completion criteria in ontology design.

Task summaries:
1. Defined core implementation type concepts and their relationships
2. Mapped overlap between implementation stages
3. Connected types to existing goal/task structure 
4. Developed completion criteria representation system
5. Integrated constraint validation approach

Solution:
Create an ontology module that defines implementation types as subclasses of a DeliveryType class, with properties indicating maturity level and required features. Link these to goals and tasks through properties like hasDeliveryType. Use SHACL shapes to define completion criteria as validated constraints against resource properties.

q1: Would SHACL be better than OWL restrictions for defining completion criteria?
q2: How could we represent the evolution between different implementation types?
q3: Should implementation types be classes or instances?
q4: What properties would best capture the maturity level of a deliverable?
