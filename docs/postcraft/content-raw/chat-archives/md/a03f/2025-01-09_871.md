Before trying your change I'd like you to explain the current problem. As I see it, DirWalker is propagating a load of messages, which are being picked up by subsequent processors. This appears to be working fine. Once DirWalker has finished, it emits a single message with the done flag. When the messages reach the Unfork processor,  all should be ignored except for the one with the done flag. But it seems many of the messages are being terminated prematurely, including the one that should be propagated . What is causing the terminations? Is there maybe somewhere where the same message object is being referred to, where there should be a structuredClone? Or is it something completely different? Please examine the code carefully and have a good think.
