 You're right - we should focus on fixing the packer processors. Looking at `src/applications/packer` in the repository context, we need a proper implementation of the FileContainer processor which combines all the files into one output.

<antThinking>This needs to create a single output file containing all files from the repository with appropriate headers and formatting. Since it's a substantial piece of code that will be reused, it should be created as an artifact.</antThinking>

These processors work together to:
1. FileContainer collects and organizes all files
2. CommentStripper removes comments from code files
3. Generated output includes file statistics and directory structure
4. Files are formatted with proper headers and spacing

q1: Would you like me to explain how these processors interact with the packer transmission pipeline?
q2: Should we add more file type handling in CommentStripper?
q3: Would you like to see a test case for these processors?
q4: Should we implement any additional output formats?
