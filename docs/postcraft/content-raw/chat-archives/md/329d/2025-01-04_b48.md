# [Error Creating Property on String in DirWalker Processor](https://claude.ai/chat/329ddc0c-3905-445f-a2dd-b8fd6e76282d)

 I see the issue now. Looking at the trace, DirWalker is trying to treat 'src' as a message object, but it's receiving it as a string. Let's look at the relevant part of DirWalker:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isnâ€™t yet supported on mobile.
```



The main issues fixed:
1. Message object now properly cloned for subdirectories
2. Counter increment handled on cloned message
3. Improved error checking for sourceDir
4. Consistent handling of paths with join()

This should resolve the TypeError by ensuring we're always working with message objects rather than strings. The recursive directory walking is now properly maintained through the message chain.

q1: Would you like me to explain the changes in more detail?
q2: Should we add support for customizable file extensions?
q3: Would you like to see the corresponding test cases?
q4: Do you want to adjust the logging level for debugging?
