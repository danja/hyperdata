# [Error Creating Property on String in DirWalker Processor](https://claude.ai/chat/329ddc0c-3905-445f-a2dd-b8fd6e76282d)

 The error persists because we need to fix the factory class for the packer processors to ensure they're properly registered. Let me create that:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



Now we need to update AbstractProcessorFactory to register the packer processors:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



The error you're seeing is because FileReader is being passed an RDF Literal as a path. We need to put the processors in the right directory and update the configuration. Let me create an about.md to document usage:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



These files should go in:
- src/processors/packer/FileContainer.js
- src/processors/packer/CommentStripper.js
- src/processors/packer/PackerProcessorsFactory.js
- src/applications/packer/about.md

q1: Would you like me to explain how to test this setup?
q2: Should we add pre-commit hooks to auto-generate repo packs?
q3: Would you like me to add handling for binary files?
q4: Should we add configuration options for file filtering?
