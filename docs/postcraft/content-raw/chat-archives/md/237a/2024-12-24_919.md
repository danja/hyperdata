 Translation:
"What do you find more important in your work?"
Left side: "An inspiring work environment"
Right side: "Creating societal impact"

The image shows a slider/scale comparing two workplace priorities: having an inspiring environment versus making a meaningful impact on society. This represents a common workplace values assessment that helps people reflect on their professional motivations.

This is a valid comparison as both factors can significantly influence job satisfaction and career choices. Neither option is inherently better - it's a personal preference that varies by individual and can shift throughout one's career.
