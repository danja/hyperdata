The goal today is to create nodejs es modules that will take Turtle syntax RDF and render is as a  graph diagram. The form-a-matic repo contains an example of parsing Turtle syntax, the json-ld-playground repo includes code for rendering a visualization of RDF using the D3 library.
Please follow these steps :
1. identify the code in the json-ld-playground repo that is used to generate visualizations. List the filenames.
2. examine the form-a-matic repo to find the JS represention it makes of the RDF model from the Turtle file 
3. locate whichever point in the json-ld-playground visualization code that is most appropriate to take the the JS representation of Turtle and pass it to the visualizer
4. modify and/or create the necessary code to read a Turtle file and render a visualization
