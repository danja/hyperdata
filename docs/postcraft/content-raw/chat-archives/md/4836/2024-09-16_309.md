 To modify the script to show directories with the most content (measuring recursively), we'll need to change the approach slightly. Here's a modified version that accomplishes this:

<antThinking>This script is a good candidate for an artifact. It's a substantial, self-contained piece of code that the user might want to modify or reuse. It's not just a simple snippet, but a full command that performs a specific task. Creating a new artifact for this modified script would be appropriate.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="dir-size-script" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Bash script to find directories with most content">
#!/bin/bash

# Find directories and their sizes, sort by size, and display the top 30
du -hd 4 | sort -rh | head -n 30
</antArtifact>

This script does the following:

1. `du` (disk usage) command is used instead of `find`. It summarizes disk usage of each directory, recursively.
2. `-h` option makes the output human-readable (e.g., 5.2G instead of 5242880).
3. `-d 4` limits the depth to 4 levels of subdirectories. You can adjust this number as needed.
4. `sort -rh` sorts the output in reverse order (-r) and considers human-readable sizes (-h).
5. `head -n 30` limits the output to the top 30 entries.

To use this script:

1. Save it to a file, e.g., `dir_size.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x dir_size.sh`
3. Run it in the directory you want to analyze: `./dir_size.sh`

This script is simpler than the original and doesn't require `awk` or `numfmt` because `du` handles the size formatting.

If you want to exclude certain directories or have more control over the depth, we can modify the script further. Would you like me to explain any part of this script or suggest any additional features?
