 Certainly, we can modify the script to exclude specific named directories. We'll use the `--exclude` option of the `du` command to achieve this. Here's an updated version:

<antThinking>This is a direct modification of the previous "dir-size-script" artifact. We're updating it to include the ability to exclude directories, which makes it more versatile and useful. We'll use the same identifier to show the evolution of the script.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="dir-size-script" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Bash script to find directories with most content, excluding specified directories">
#!/bin/bash

# Directories to exclude (add more as needed, separated by backslash and pipe)
EXCLUDE_DIRS="node_modules\|.git\|.cache"

# Find directories and their sizes, excluding specified directories,
# then sort by size and display the top 30
du -hd 4 --exclude="$EXCLUDE_DIRS" | sort -rh | head -n 30
</antArtifact>

Here's what changed in this updated script:

1. We added a variable `EXCLUDE_DIRS` that contains a list of directories to exclude. In this example, it's set to exclude 'node_modules', '.git', and '.cache' directories.

2. The `du` command now includes the `--exclude` option, which takes a pattern. We pass our `EXCLUDE_DIRS` variable to this option.

3. The rest of the command remains the same.

To use this script:

1. Save it to a file, e.g., `dir_size_exclude.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x dir_size_exclude.sh`
3. Run it in the directory you want to analyze: `./dir_size_exclude.sh`

You can easily modify the `EXCLUDE_DIRS` variable to include any additional directories you want to exclude. Just add them to the list, separated by `\|` (backslash and pipe). For example:

```bash
EXCLUDE_DIRS="node_modules\|.git\|.cache\|build\|dist"
```

This would exclude 'node_modules', '.git', '.cache', 'build', and 'dist' directories.

If you want to make the script more flexible, you could modify it to accept exclude patterns as command-line arguments. Would you like me to show you how to do that?
