 I see the issue. The problem is in how the exclude argument is being constructed and passed to the `du` command. Let's modify the script to fix this:

<antThinking>We're updating the "dir-size-script" artifact again to fix the exclude functionality based on the user's modifications and the error they're seeing. This update will make the script work as intended.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="dir-size-script" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="bash" title="Bash script to find directories with most content, excluding specified directories">
#!/bin/bash

EXCLUDE_DIRS=("node_modules" "packages" "ppm" ".git")
TARGET_DIR="${1:-.}"

# Construct the exclude arguments
EXCLUDE_ARGS=""
for dir in "${EXCLUDE_DIRS[@]}"; do
    EXCLUDE_ARGS+="--exclude=$dir "
done

echo "Target directory: $TARGET_DIR"
echo "Exclude arguments: $EXCLUDE_ARGS"

du -hd 4 $EXCLUDE_ARGS "$TARGET_DIR" | sort -rh | head -n 30
</antArtifact>

Here's what changed and why:

1. We removed the attempt to use brace expansion (`{...}`) in the `EXCLUDE_ARGS`. While this works in some contexts, it's not necessary or helpful for `du`'s `--exclude` option.

2. We construct `EXCLUDE_ARGS` by adding `--exclude=` before each directory name. This is the correct syntax for `du`.

3. We removed the `./` prefix from the excluded directories. `du` will match these patterns anywhere in the path, so `./` is not needed and can sometimes cause issues.

4. We put `"$TARGET_DIR"` in quotes to handle paths with spaces correctly.

5. We've adjusted the echo statements to make the output clearer for debugging.

This script should now work correctly. It will exclude the specified directories regardless of where they appear in the directory structure.

To use this script:

1. Save it to a file, e.g., `dir_size_exclude.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x dir_size_exclude.sh`
3. Run it, optionally specifying the directory to analyze:
   - To analyze the current directory: `./dir_size_exclude.sh`
   - To analyze a specific directory: `./dir_size_exclude.sh /path/to/directory`

The script will now correctly exclude the specified directories and show you the sizes of the remaining directories, sorted from largest to smallest.

If you're still having issues, please let me know the output you're seeing, and we can troubleshoot further.
