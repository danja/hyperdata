 You're absolutely right - let's step back from testing/deployment and focus purely on the correct Docker Compose healthcheck syntax.

Looking at the source file, there's actually an example right in front of us - the working Prosody healthcheck:

```yaml
  xmpp:
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "prosodyctl", "status"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
```

Since this syntax pattern works, let's adapt it for Fuseki:

```yaml
  fuseki:
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3030/$/ping"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
```

q1: Should we first confirm curl is available in the Fuseki image?

q2: Would you like to know alternative health check commands if curl isn't available?

q3: Should we look at the Fuseki image's Dockerfile to see what tools are installed?

q4: Would you like to test just this single line change first?
