# [Lightweight Docker Container Monitoring Setup](https://claude.ai/chat/cc2d63e3-746b-417d-a551-760eaa48b74b)

I want to set up this Docker container as a box for experiments. There will be a bunch of smallish services, fuseki for sparql and prosody for xmpp from images, several of my own from node with nginx. I'd like to be able to get a simple status message for service x, y, z using existing kit, without too much overhead. I've heard grafana and prometheus mentioned in this kind of context, but I don't know what they are like in terms of overhead. Something with a pretty dashboard might be nice, but again, not too much overhead. By overhead I'm meaning not only for the machine, but also for me cognitively and anyone else that might want to use this setup without server admin knowledge.
