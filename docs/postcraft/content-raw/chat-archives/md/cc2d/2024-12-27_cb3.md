 I acknowledge analyzing the requirements and breaking down the tasks. Here's the solution approach:

A lightweight monitoring stack using cAdvisor for container metrics, combined with a simple custom health endpoint for each service, exposed through a unified dashboard in Node.js Express.

Task summaries:
1. Add basic health check endpoints to Node services
2. Configure Fuseki/Prosody built-in monitoring
3. Create central monitoring service using Express
4. Implement simple dashboard UI

Solution: Use existing Docker health checks, add custom /health endpoints to Node services, and create a minimal monitoring dashboard service. This provides basic up/down status, resource usage, and service-specific metrics without the complexity of Grafana/Prometheus. The dashboard can be accessed via standard web browser and provides a straightforward view of system health.

q1: Would you like to see how to implement basic health check endpoints for the Node services?

q2: Should we explore the built-in monitoring capabilities of Fuseki and Prosody?

q3: Would you like to see a simple implementation of the central monitoring dashboard?

q4: Would you prefer to start with just Docker's native health checks before adding more complexity?
