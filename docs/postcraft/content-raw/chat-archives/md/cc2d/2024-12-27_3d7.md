 Ah - you make an excellent point! Let's take a step back:

1. We shouldn't assume curl exists in the Fuseki container
2. Testing from inside the container is less reliable than testing from outside
3. We already have a monitor service that can do external checks

A better approach: Remove the Fuseki healthcheck entirely from the Fuseki service definition and handle health monitoring through the monitor service, which can make HTTP requests to Fuseki's ping endpoint from outside. This is more robust and doesn't depend on container internals.

Solution: Remove the `healthcheck` block from the Fuseki service in docker-compose.yml.

q1: Would you like to see how to implement proper external health monitoring in the monitor service?

q2: Should we look at doing the same for the other services?

q3: Would you like to see how to implement proper retry/timeout logic for external checks?

q4: Should we add alerting when services become unhealthy?
