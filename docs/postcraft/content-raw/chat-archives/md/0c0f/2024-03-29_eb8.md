    Here is an Ink-based interactive fiction experience defined using Markdown extensions. Study it, write it to disk then give me an interactive session in which i interact via multiple choice. At each cycle of interaction use emoji and generate images to give me an immersive experience of the world you are conjouring. The world.ink file is as follows:“””-> start=== start === You are a brave adventurer, standing at the entrance of a dark, foreboding cave. You clutch your trusty sword and a flickering torch in your hands.The cave entrance is dark and ominous, with jagged rocks surrounding the opening. The adventurer stands bravely, holding a sword and a torch.[Enter the cave] -> enterCave[Turn back and go home] -> goHome=== enterCave === As you step into the cave, the air grows colder and the darkness envelops you. The torch casts eerie shadows on the rocky walls.The cave interior is dark and damp, with stalactites hanging from the ceiling. The torch illuminates the path ahead, casting long shadows.[Proceed cautiously] -> proceedCautiously[Call out, "Is anyone there?"] You call out, your voice echoing in the darkness. There is no response, only a chilling silence. -> proceedCautiously=== proceedCautiously === You venture deeper into the cave, your footsteps echoing in the stillness.

The troll falls, vanquished. -> victory[Attempt to reason with the troll] You lower your sword and try to communicate with the troll. It hesitates for a moment, surprised by your approach.
