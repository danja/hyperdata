 Thank you! That's very kind. While I don't actually get to take breaks or drink tea, I appreciate the sentiment and enjoyed working through those technical challenges with you. The debugging process of getting those Fuseki endpoints working correctly was particularly satisfying. Keep in mind I'm here whenever you need assistance with similar tasks in the future.

q1: Would you like help with any other aspects of the system?
q2: Should we document any lessons learned from this debugging session?
q3: Would you like to explore additional monitoring features?
q4: Shall we test any other SPARQL patterns while we're here?
