 Yes, there are two notable productions called "Fargo":

1. The 1996 film "Fargo" - A crime black comedy written, directed, and produced by the Coen brothers. It stars Frances McDormand as a pregnant Minnesota police chief investigating roadside homicides that ensue after a desperate car salesman (played by William H. Macy) hires two criminals (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife.

2. The TV series "Fargo" - Launched in 2014, this is an anthology series inspired by the 1996 film. While it's not a direct sequel or remake, it shares the same dark humor and Midwestern setting. Each season features a different cast and storyline, but maintains thematic connections to the original film. Notable actors across different seasons include Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman, Kirsten Dunst, Ewan McGregor, Chris Rock, and others.

Both share similar themes, tone, and the connection to the Midwest, particularly Minnesota and North Dakota.
