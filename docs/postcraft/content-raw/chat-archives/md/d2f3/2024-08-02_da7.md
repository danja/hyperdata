 Based on the test results, it appears that some tests are failing or encountering errors. Let's address these issues:

1. The file-pipeline test is timing out. This could be due to an asynchronous operation not completing or an infinite loop.

2. The PostcraftPrep tests are failing due to missing or incorrectly named methods. It seems that the implementation of PostcraftPrep has changed since these tests were written.

3. The StringReplace tests are passing successfully.

Here are some suggestions to address these issues:

1. For the file-pipeline test:
   - Review the implementation to ensure all asynchronous operations are properly handled.
   - Consider increasing the timeout for this specific test if it's a long-running operation.

2. For the PostcraftPrep tests:
   - Update the test cases to match the current implementation of PostcraftPrep.
   - Ensure that the methods `extractName`, `extractTargetFilename`, and `extractLink` exist in the PostcraftPrep class.
   - Update the `extractTargetFilename` test to provide the necessary `targetDir` property in the context object.

3. For the passing StringReplace tests:
   - Good job! These tests are working as expected.

To fix these issues:

1. Review and update the file-pipeline implementation and test.
2. Update the PostcraftPrep class and its corresponding tests to align with the current implementation.
3. Run the tests again after making these changes to ensure all tests pass.

Q1: Would you like me to provide updated code for the PostcraftPrep tests?
Q2: Should we investigate why the file-pipeline test is timing out?
Q3: Are there any other tests we should add to improve coverage?
