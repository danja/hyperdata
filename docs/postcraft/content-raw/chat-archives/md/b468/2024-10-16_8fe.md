 I'd be happy to work through these tasks with you one at a time. Let's start with the first task:

1. Review the notion of meme in the sense used by Richard Dawkins and Susan Blackmore and any subsequent research and discussion.

The concept of meme was introduced by Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book "The Selfish Gene." Dawkins proposed memes as cultural analogues to genes, serving as units of cultural transmission or imitation. The term is derived from the Greek word "mimema," meaning "something imitated."

Key points about memes according to Dawkins:
- Memes are replicators, similar to genes in biological evolution.
- They can be ideas, behaviors, or styles that spread from person to person within a culture.
- Memes undergo a process of evolution, including variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance.

Susan Blackmore, in her 1999 book "The Meme Machine," expanded on Dawkins' concept:
- She argued that memes are the basis of cultural evolution, shaping human behavior and culture.
- Blackmore introduced the idea of "memeplexes" - groups of memes that replicate together.
- She explored how memes might influence human consciousness and the concept of self.

Subsequent research and discussion:
1. Criticism and debate:
   - Some scholars question the scientific validity of memes, arguing that cultural transmission is more complex than the meme concept suggests.
   - Others debate whether memes can be considered discrete units like genes.

2. Memetics:
   - An interdisciplinary field studying memes and cultural evolution emerged, though it remains controversial.

3. Digital memes:
   - The internet has given rise to a new understanding of memes as viral content (images, videos, phrases) that spread rapidly online.

4. Cognitive approaches:
   - Dan Sperber's "epidemiology of representations" offers an alternative framework for understanding cultural transmission based on cognitive science.

5. Cultural evolution studies:
   - Researchers like Robert Boyd, Peter Richerson, and Joseph Henrich have developed more nuanced models of cultural evolution without necessarily using the term "meme."

6. Neurological basis:
   - Some researchers have explored the potential neurological basis for meme transmission and retention.

7. Application in various fields:
   - The meme concept has been applied in fields such as marketing, social media analysis, and information warfare.

This review provides a foundation for understanding memes. Would you like me to proceed to the second task, or do you need any clarification on this first part?
