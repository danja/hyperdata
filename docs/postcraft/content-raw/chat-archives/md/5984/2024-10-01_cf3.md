 Certainly, I'll list the top open-source JavaScript engines for Java on Android, considering your priorities of Node.js compatibility, popularity, feature coverage, and maintenance. Here's a rundown of the most relevant options:

1. Duktape
   - Compatibility with Node: Limited, but can run pure JavaScript
   - Popularity: High for embedded use
   - Feature coverage: Good for ECMAScript 5.1 with some ES6 features
   - Maintenance: Active, last release in 2023

2. J2V8
   - Compatibility with Node: High, as it's based on V8
   - Popularity: Moderate
   - Feature coverage: Excellent, supports most modern JavaScript features
   - Maintenance: Active, but less frequent updates

3. Rhino
   - Compatibility with Node: Limited
   - Popularity: High, especially for older projects
   - Feature coverage: Good for ES5, some ES6 support
   - Maintenance: Still maintained, but less active

4. QuickJS
   - Compatibility with Node: Limited, but good ES6+ support
   - Popularity: Growing
   - Feature coverage: Excellent, supports up to ES2020
   - Maintenance: Active, frequent updates

5. Nashorn (deprecated in Java 11+, but still usable)
   - Compatibility with Node: Limited
   - Popularity: Was high when bundled with Java
   - Feature coverage: Good for ES5 and some ES6
   - Maintenance: No longer actively maintained

6. GraalVM JavaScript (part of GraalVM)
   - Compatibility with Node: High, includes a Node.js implementation
   - Popularity: Growing, especially in enterprise environments
   - Feature coverage: Excellent, supports latest ECMAScript features
   - Maintenance: Very active, frequent updates

Among these options, considering your priorities:

1. J2V8 might be the best overall choice due to its high Node.js compatibility and good feature coverage. However, it can be complex to set up.

2. Duktape is a solid choice if you need a lightweight option and don't require full Node.js compatibility.

3. GraalVM JavaScript offers the best Node.js compatibility and feature coverage, but it might be overkill for simple projects and can be resource-intensive.

4. QuickJS is worth considering if you need modern JavaScript features but don't necessarily need full Node.js compatibility.

Remember that full Node.js compatibility on Android is challenging to achieve, as many Node.js APIs rely on system-level features that aren't available in the Android runtime environment. You'll likely need to create custom bindings or shims for certain Node.js functionalities regardless of which engine you choose.
