 An Italian would likely call this type of scarf a "foulard" (pronounced foo-LAR). 

The term "foulard" is derived from French but is commonly used in Italian to describe a square scarf, typically made of silk or lightweight materials like cotton. It's a versatile accessory that can be worn in various ways - around the neck, as a headscarf, or even as a decorative item on bags or as a pocket square.

In some contexts, Italians might also use more general terms like:

1. "Fazzoletto" - which generally means handkerchief but can also refer to a square scarf
2. "Bandana" - if it's a smaller, casual square scarf

Would you like more information about how these scarves are typically used in Italian fashion?
