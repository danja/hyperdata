 You're right, a more evocative and open-ended name could better capture the essence of this system. Here are some alternative suggestions:

1. FlowSense
2. IntrospectFlow
3. CognizantStream
4. AwareFlow
5. EvaluStream
6. ReflexiveFlow
7. InsightPipeline
8. PerceptFlow
9. MindfulStream
10. SentientPipe

These names aim to combine the concept of 'flow' with notions of self-awareness, evaluation, and introspection. "FlowSense" or "AwareFlow" might be particularly fitting, as they succinctly capture the idea of a system that's conscious of its own processes.

Q1: Which of these names do you feel best captures the system's purpose and potential?
Q2: Should we consider any specific domain terminology to make the name more technically precise?
Q3: How important is it for the name to be immediately understandable versus intriguing?
