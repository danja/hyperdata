 Excellent choice. FlowSense effectively captures the essence of a self-aware, evaluative system integrated into the flow of operations.

Let's proceed with refining the FlowSense concept and its integration into the Transmissions engine:

1. Core Components:
   - SenseCollector (formerly MetricCollector)
   - SenseRegistry (formerly MetricRegistry)
   - SenseEvaluator (formerly MetricEvaluator)
   - SensePluginManager (formerly PluginManager)
   - FlowLogger (formerly LogIntegrator)
   - EvalCardParser (formerly EvaluationCardParser)

2. Integration:
   - Extend Processor with FlowSense capabilities
   - Implement FlowSenseProcessor for pipeline insertion
   - Add FlowSense configuration to transmission files

3. Implementation steps:
   - Define interfaces for core components
   - Implement SenseCollector and SenseRegistry
   - Create FlowSenseProcessor prototype
   - Develop EvalCardParser for RDF Turtle input
   - Integrate with existing logging system

Q1: How can we ensure FlowSense adapts to different types of 'senses' beyond traditional metrics?
Q2: What mechanisms should we put in place to manage the performance impact of FlowSense?
Q3: How can we design FlowSense to be useful for both development and production environments?
