 If the src/services/* files are not listed under classes when you run JSDoc, there could be several reasons for this. Let's explore some possible causes and solutions:

1. JSDoc configuration:
   Ensure that your JSDoc configuration file (usually jsdoc.json or jsdoc.conf.json) includes the correct paths to your source files.

2. Class syntax:
   Make sure you're using the ES6 class syntax in your service files. JSDoc might not recognize classes if they're defined using older patterns.

3. Export statement:
   Verify that your classes are properly exported using the `export default` or `export` statements.

4. JSDoc comments:
   Ensure that you have JSDoc comments for your classes, including the `@class` tag if necessary.

5. File extensions:
   Check if JSDoc is configured to recognize the file extensions you're using (e.g., .js, .mjs, etc.).

To help diagnose the issue, I'd recommend:

1. Double-checking your JSDoc configuration file.
2. Verifying the class syntax and export statements in your service files.
3. Running JSDoc with the `--debug` flag to get more detailed output about what files are being processed.

Q1: Can you share your JSDoc configuration file contents?
Q2: Are there any error messages or warnings when you run JSDoc?
Q3: Have you tried running JSDoc on a single service file to see if it's recognized correctly?
