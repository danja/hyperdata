 I see. If FileCopy.html exists but isn't appearing in the index, this suggests that JSDoc is processing the file but not including it in the generated documentation index for some reason. Let's explore some potential causes and solutions:

1. Class documentation:
   Ensure that the FileCopy class has a proper JSDoc comment block right above its declaration. It should include the `@class` tag.

2. Module documentation:
   Add a module documentation block at the top of the file. This can help JSDoc understand the file's structure better.

3. Visibility:
   Check if you're using any tags that might be affecting visibility, like `@private` or `@ignore`.

4. JSDoc configuration:
   Verify that your configuration isn't excluding certain files or using a template that might be filtering out some classes.

5. Inheritance:
   If FileCopy extends another class, make sure the parent class is also documented properly.

Here's an example of how the top of your FileCopy.js file might look with proper JSDoc comments:

```javascript
/**
 * @module FileCopy
 */

/**
 * FileCopy class for copying files and directories.
 * @class
 * @extends Service
 */
class FileCopy extends Service {
    // ... rest of the class
}
```

Q1: Does adding or modifying the JSDoc comments as shown above help with the indexing issue?
Q2: Are other service files appearing in the index, or is this issue specific to FileCopy?
Q3: What version of JSDoc are you using, and have you considered updating to the latest version if you're not already using it?
