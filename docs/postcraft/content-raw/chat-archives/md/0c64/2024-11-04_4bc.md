 Let me explain the Pareto frontier through a simple example.

The Pareto frontier is the set of all possible solutions where you can't improve one objective without worsening another. The classic example is a trade-off between cost and quality:

Consider buying a laptop with two main criteria:
1. Price (lower is better)
2. Performance (higher is better)

If we plot different laptops on a graph:
- X-axis: Price
- Y-axis: Performance

The Pareto frontier would be the curve showing the best possible performance at each price point. Laptops on this frontier represent optimal trade-offs - to get better performance, you must pay more money; to spend less money, you must accept lower performance.

Laptops not on the frontier are "dominated" because you can find other laptops that are:
- Same price but better performance, or
- Same performance but cheaper, or 
- Both cheaper AND better performing

Key points about Pareto frontiers:
- Help find optimal solutions with competing objectives
- No "perfect" solution exists - involves trade-offs
- Solutions below the frontier are suboptimal
- Can involve more than 2 objectives (though harder to visualize)

Common applications include:
- Product design (cost vs features)
- Investment (risk vs return)
- Public policy (different societal goals)
- Engineering (performance vs reliability)

The main insight is that with multiple competing objectives, there's rarely one "best" solution - rather a set of optimal trade-offs to choose from based on your priorities.
