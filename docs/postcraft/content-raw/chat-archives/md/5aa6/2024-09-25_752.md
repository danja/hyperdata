# [Automatically Rendering JSON and Markdown as RDF](https://claude.ai/chat/5aa6d089-8c61-4ff7-b00a-be0d4f40a504)

 Certainly, I can help you come up with some expansions for GRLLR that relate to your project of automatically rendering JSON and markdown data as RDF. Here are a few possibilities:

1. Gleaning Resource Linkages from Lightweight Representations

2. Graph Rendering of Lightweight Linked Resources

3. Generating RDF from Lightweight Language Resources

4. Gleaning RDF from Lightweight Linguistic Representations

5. Graph Resource Linking from Lightweight Renditions

Each of these expansions tries to capture the essence of what you're doing - transforming lightweight formats like JSON and Markdown into more structured RDF representations. The "Gleaning" aspect is retained from GRDDL in some options to maintain that connection.

Do any of these resonate with you? I can brainstorm more options if you'd like, or we can discuss how to refine these to better fit your specific needs.
