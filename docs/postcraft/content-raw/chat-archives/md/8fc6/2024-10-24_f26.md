Do you recognise the following from research anywhere : Tensor Structure Design:

Basic Dimensions:
```
C[r, a, p, t] where:
r = representation type (logical, probabilistic, linguistic...)
a = abstraction level
p = precision/formality degree
t = contextual thickness
```

Measuring Components:
- Internal Consistency (Ic)
  * Self-referential coherence within a representation
  * Measurable through contradiction detection
  * Logical systems: proof consistency
  * Probabilistic systems: distribution stability
  * Could be quantified as distance between repeated samplings

- Cross-Representation Stability (Cs)
  * How well meaning preserves across transforms
  * Measurable through:
    - Round-trip translation loss
    - Invariant feature preservation
    - Semantic drift metrics
  * Numeric range: 0 (complete loss) to 1 (perfect preservation)
