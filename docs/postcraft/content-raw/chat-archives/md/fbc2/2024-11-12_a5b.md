 I've reviewed the PROV, IBIS and W6 ontologies from the project files.

Task summaries:
1. Analyzed W6's interrogative structure (who/what/why/when/where/how)
2. Mapped IBIS's issue-position-argument framework to intent sequences
3. Examined PROV's activity-entity-agent tracking for action flows
4. Identified complementary aspects across ontologies

Solution:
A composite approach leveraging:
- W6 for basic intent categorization using its six fundamental questions
- IBIS for capturing the deliberative aspects through Position and Argument classes
- PROV for tracking the actual execution flow via Activity and Agent classes
- Intent-action mappings using PROV's wasGeneratedBy and wasAssociatedWith, combined with IBIS's respondsTo

This provides traceable intent-to-action paths while maintaining decision context.

q1: Could W6's interrogative properties be extended to capture more nuanced intents?

q2: How might IBIS's argumentation structure help resolve conflicting intents?

q3: Could PROV's influence model represent intent propagation between agents?

q4: What role could qualified associations play in intent attribution?
