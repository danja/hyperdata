 I've analyzed this in terms of semantic interpretation and pragmatic meaning representation.

Task summary steps:
1. Identified core intent classification dimensions
2. Evaluated semantic frameworks for intent modeling  
3. Mapped intent categories to ontological structures
4. Designed capture mechanism integrating NLP and knowledge representation

Solution:
Intent can be modeled through a layered approach combining:
- Speech act classification (inform/request/commit/express)
- Domain action categorization (query/transact/navigate/etc)
- Sentiment/affect detection
- Contextual resolution using dialogue state tracking
- Knowledge graph embedding of intent-action mappings

This allows capture of both explicit and implicit intent through multi-modal analysis, grounded in semantic web standards for interoperability.

q1: How could speech acts be formally represented in RDF?

q2: What role could reinforcement learning play in improving intent detection?

q3: How might intent ontologies be aligned across different agent frameworks?

q4: What methods exist for handling ambiguous or compound intents?
