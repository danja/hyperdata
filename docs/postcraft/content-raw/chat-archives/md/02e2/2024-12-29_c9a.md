 I'll create code for adaptive context sizing and overlap handling.

<antThinking>This requires relatively complex code for text segmentation and window management. An artifact would be appropriate for this reusable functionality.</antThinking>
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



Now let's integrate this with the ContextManager:
```

```


```

```



Key features added:
1. Adaptive window sizing based on input length
2. Overlapping windows to maintain context continuity 
3. Smart merging of overlapping content
4. Token estimation for optimal segmentation
5. Configurable overlap ratios and window sizes

The ContextWindowManager handles the technical aspects of text segmentation, while the ContextManager uses it when needed to handle large contexts.

Q1: Would you like to see integration tests for these new features?
Q2: Should we add support for custom tokenization?
Q3: Would you like to see implementation of priority-based window selection?
Q4: Should we add performance optimizations for large context processing?
