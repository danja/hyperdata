 Certainly, I'll provide a brief comparison of turndown and the alternatives based on your priorities:

1. Turndown:
   Pros:
   - Very popular (over 1.5 million weekly downloads on npm)
   - Actively maintained (last update within the last 6 months as of my knowledge cutoff)
   - Highly extensible with a plugin system
   - Good documentation
   
   Cons:
   - Slightly larger bundle size compared to some alternatives

2. html-to-markdown:
   Pros:
   - Lightweight
   - Simple to use
   
   Cons:
   - Less popular (about 30,000 weekly downloads)
   - Less actively maintained
   - Limited extensibility compared to turndown

3. node-html-markdown:
   Pros:
   - Claims to be faster than turndown
   - Actively maintained
   - Growing in popularity (about 100,000 weekly downloads)
   
   Cons:
   - Less extensive documentation
   - Fewer options for customization compared to turndown

Given your priorities:

1. Popularity: Turndown is the clear winner.
2. Maintenance: Both turndown and node-html-markdown are well-maintained.
3. Extensibility: Turndown offers the most options for customization and extension.

Based on these factors, turndown seems to align best with your priorities. It's the most popular, well-maintained, and offers the most extensibility. However, if performance is a critical factor for your use case, you might want to benchmark turndown against node-html-markdown.
