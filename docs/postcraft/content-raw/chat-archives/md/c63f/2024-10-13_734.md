 I have analyzed the question, identified key concepts and components, and broken down the problem into tasks. Here's a summary of the solution:

1. Analyzed existing pipeline structure in Transmission.js
2. Reviewed simple function operation in NOP.js
3. Considered approaches for adding recursion support
4. Selected the most promising approach: Nested Pipelines
5. Designed implementation strategy for Nested Pipelines

The chosen solution involves implementing Nested Pipelines, allowing recursion by defining pipelines that can contain other pipelines. This approach maintains the existing structure while adding flexibility for recursive operations.

Implementation steps:
1. Modify Transmission class to support nested pipelines
2. Create a new RecursivePipeline processor
3. Update TransmissionBuilder to handle nested pipeline definitions
4. Implement recursive execution logic in the execute method
5. Add safeguards to prevent infinite recursion

This solution provides a flexible and maintainable way to add recursion support to the existing Transmissions system.

q1: How would the Transmission class need to be modified to support nested pipelines?
q2: What safeguards could be implemented to prevent infinite recursion?
q3: How might the TTL configuration files need to be updated to define nested pipelines?
q4: What are the potential performance implications of implementing nested pipelines?
