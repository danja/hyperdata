 Alternatives to nested pipelines for achieving recursive functionality include:

1. Function-based recursion: Implement recursion within individual processors, allowing them to call themselves or other processors directly.

2. Iterator pattern: Use an iterator to repeatedly process data through a single pipeline until a condition is met.

3. Stack-based execution: Maintain a stack of processors or pipeline stages, allowing dynamic pushing and popping for recursive-like behavior.

4. Event-driven recursion: Implement a pub/sub system where processors can emit events that trigger re-execution of parts of the pipeline.

5. State machine approach: Define pipeline stages as states, with transitions allowing revisiting of previous states for recursive-like flows.

The function-based recursion approach is likely the simplest to implement but may sacrifice some of the declarative nature of the current system.

q1: How would function-based recursion impact the current processor interface?
q2: What are the trade-offs between nested pipelines and the iterator pattern approach?
q3: How might a stack-based execution model be implemented within the current architecture?
q4: What advantages does the event-driven recursion approach offer for complex workflows?
