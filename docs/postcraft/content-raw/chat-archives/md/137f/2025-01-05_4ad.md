 Yes, we can transfer files directly to your Ubuntu machine, but iPhones are a bit more restrictive than Android - they use the "Lightning" connector (a small, rectangular connector that can plug in either way up).

You'll need:
1. A Lightning-to-USB cable (should have come with the phone)
2. The software I mentioned before to handle the iPhone's security protocols

Once we install the necessary tools, we can view and transfer photos, videos, and certain other files. However, it won't be quite as straightforward as Android's drag-and-drop.

Let's start with checking what's taking up space on the phone:
1. Go to Settings
2. General
3. iPhone Storage

This will show you what's using up space. Common culprits are:
- Photos/Videos
- Messages (especially if they contain photos/videos)
- Apps

Would you like me to walk you through setting up the Ubuntu tools now? Also, do you have the Lightning cable available? If not, you might need to purchase one - they're widely available and don't need to be Apple brand.

To clear up some iCloud space quickly, we could also delete any large files from iCloud without deleting them from the phone first, if you'd like to try that approach.
