 To mount the iPhone as a drive on Ubuntu over WiFi, we'll need to use the AFC (Apple File Conduit) protocol. However, even after installation, this is typically less reliable over WiFi than USB - Apple's security model makes network mounting quite restrictive.

However, we can try. Here's what we need:

```bash
# Install required packages
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libimobiledevice6 libimobiledevice-utils ifuse usbmuxd
```

Then try:
```bash
# Create mount point if you haven't already
mkdir ~/iphone

# Try to pair and mount (this may or may not work over WiFi)
idevicepair pair
ifuse ~/iphone
```

Given Apple's restrictions, this might not work reliably over WiFi. I'm now thinking we should explore:

1. Would you be able to get a Lightning-to-USB cable? This would make the process much more straightforward and reliable.

2. Or if you're mainly concerned about specific types of data like photos, we could use a more targeted solution that works well over WiFi.

What specific types of data are you most concerned about saving from the phone? This might help us find the most practical solution given the WiFi-only constraint.
