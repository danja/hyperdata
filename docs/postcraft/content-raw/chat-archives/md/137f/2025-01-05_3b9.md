 I'm very sorry for your loss. Losing a parent is incredibly difficult, and I hope you're taking care of yourself during this time.

Regarding the iPhone - I'll help you through the key steps to set it up as your own device. First, we need to make sure you can fully access and reset the phone:

1. Does the phone currently have a passcode or is it locked to your mother's Apple ID? If so, you'll need to:
   - Have her Apple ID password, or
   - Have documentation of inheritance/death certificate to work with Apple Support to unlock it

Once you have access, here are the main steps:

1. Back up any photos or data you want to keep from your mother's phone
2. Go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings
3. After the reset, you can set up the phone as new:
   - Create or sign in with your own Apple ID
   - Set up Face ID/Touch ID
   - Choose your preferred settings

Would you like me to guide you through any of these specific steps? Also, what's your current situation with the phone - do you have full access to it, or do you need help with the initial unlocking process?
