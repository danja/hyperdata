 Yes, temporarily upgrading iCloud is actually one of the most straightforward solutions! Here's how:

1. Check current usage:
   - Go to Settings
   - Tap her Apple ID at the top
   - Select "iCloud"
   - You'll see the storage bar and what's using space

2. Buy more storage temporarily:
   - In the same iCloud screen
   - Tap "Manage Storage" or "Manage Account Storage"
   - Select "Change Storage Plan" or "Buy More Storage"
   - Plans are typically:
     - 50GB ($0.99/month)
     - 200GB ($2.99/month)
     - 2TB ($9.99/month)

You can:
1. Upgrade
2. Do a full backup
3. Download what you want
4. Cancel the subscription (you'll still have the rest of the month you paid for)

Want to check how much storage you need first? Go to:
Settings > General > iPhone Storage
This will show exactly what's taking up space.

Would you like me to guide you through checking the storage usage first, or should we jump straight to upgrading iCloud?
