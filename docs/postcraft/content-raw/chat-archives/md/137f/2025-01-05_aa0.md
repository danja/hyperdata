 Ah, that's actually helpful to know. For Ubuntu, we'll want to use an alternative to iTunes since it's not available for Linux. Here's how we can handle this:

1. For basic file transfer (photos, videos, etc):
   - Install libimobiledevice (this is the Linux tool for iOS devices)
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install libimobiledevice6 libimobiledevice-utils
   ```
   - Install ifuse to mount the iPhone:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ifuse
   ```
   - Create a mount point:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/iphone
   ```
   - Connect and mount the iPhone:
   ```bash
   ifuse ~/iphone
   ```

2. For photos specifically, you could also use gPhotos:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install gphoto2
   ```

The iCloud backup is probably still your safest bet for a complete backup:
1. Go to Settings
2. Make sure you're connected to WiFi
3. Check available iCloud storage (Settings > [Apple ID name] > iCloud)
4. If needed, you can buy temporary extra storage just for the backup

Would you like me to walk you through either:
1. Setting up the Ubuntu tools to access the phone
2. Checking iCloud storage and doing a backup there

Also, do you know if your mother was using iCloud backup already? We can check this in Settings.
