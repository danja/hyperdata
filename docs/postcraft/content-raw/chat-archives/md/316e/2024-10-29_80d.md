# [Evaluating WD-40 as a Lubricant](https://claude.ai/chat/316e8b86-b3dd-4cef-add0-26663c2c0ecc)

 I've analyzed the requirements for woodwind instrument lubrication.

Task summaries:
1. Clarinet key oil needs to be non-corrosive and instrument-safe
2. Must be long-lasting and clean
3. Must not affect wood/cork components
4. Viscosity requirements are specific

Solution: Generic lubricating oil is superior to WD-40 for clarinet joints, but specialized key oils are best. They're formulated specifically for instrument mechanics, with optimal viscosity and no harmful additives.

q1: What specific brands of key oil are recommended for clarinets?
q2: How often should clarinet joints be re-oiled?
q3: What damage can incorrect oils cause to clarinet mechanisms?
q4: Should different oils be used for different parts of the clarinet?
