# [Git clone error: RPC failed, unexpected disconnect](https://claude.ai/chat/283488b8-c37b-4354-b4fd-0deeb4369e9c)

 This error message indicates that there was a problem during the Git clone operation. Let's break down what happened and suggest some possible solutions:

1. The clone operation started successfully and began downloading objects.

2. However, it encountered an error during the download process:
   - RPC (Remote Procedure Call) failed
   - curl error 92: HTTP/2 stream was not closed cleanly
   - Unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
   - Early EOF (End of File)

These errors typically suggest network issues or problems with the connection to the GitHub server. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check your internet connection to ensure it's stable.

2. Try the clone operation again. Sometimes transient network issues resolve themselves on a retry.

3. If you're behind a firewall or using a VPN, try disabling them temporarily to see if they're interfering with the connection.

4. Use the `--verbose` flag to get more information:
   ```
   git clone --verbose --depth 1 https://github.com/danja/hyperdata.git
   ```

5. If the problem persists, you can try cloning without the `--depth 1` option:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/danja/hyperdata.git
   ```

6. You could also try using SSH instead of HTTPS if you have SSH access set up:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:danja/hyperdata.git
   ```

7. If none of the above work, you might want to check if there are any issues with GitHub's servers or your local Git installation.

If you continue to experience problems, you may want to consult your network administrator or reach out to GitHub support for further assistance.

Would you like me to explain any part of this error message or the suggested solutions in more detail?
