 This error message indicates a problem with installing or configuring the Node.js package in Termux. The main issue is that the system can't find a required library (`libicui18n.so.73`). Let's break down the error and suggest some solutions:

1. The error states that the executable "node" cannot be linked because it's missing the library "libicui18n.so.73".

2. This caused the post-installation script for the nodejs package to fail.

3. As a result, dpkg (the package management system) encountered an error while processing the nodejs package.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Update your package lists and upgrade existing packages:
   ```
   pkg update
   pkg upgrade
   ```

2. If that doesn't work, try reinstalling Node.js:
   ```
   pkg remove nodejs
   pkg install nodejs
   ```

3. If you're still encountering issues, you might need to install the missing ICU (International Components for Unicode) library:
   ```
   pkg install libicu
   ```

4. After installing libicu, try installing Node.js again:
   ```
   pkg install nodejs
   ```

5. If none of the above work, you can try clearing Termux's package cache and then reinstalling:
   ```
   pkg clean
   pkg install nodejs
   ```

6. As a last resort, you might want to consider using a different version of Node.js. You can specify a version like this:
   ```
   pkg install nodejs-lts
   ```
   This installs the Long Term Support version, which might be more stable in some environments.

If you continue to experience issues after trying these steps, it might be worth checking if there are any known issues with the current Node.js package in Termux, or if your Termux installation needs updating.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these steps or explain anything in more detail?
