 Task 1: Generalized problem description

"Semantic Gap in Information Retrieval for Contextual Queries"

This problem involves the mismatch between a user's query intent and the available information in a knowledge base due to:

1. Contextual language use (e.g., slang, idioms)
2. Implicit knowledge assumptions
3. Lack of semantic understanding in the retrieval system

The challenge is to bridge this semantic gap to provide relevant results even when the exact query terms are not present in the corpus.

Q1: How does this problem relate to word sense disambiguation?
Q2: What role does entity linking play in addressing this issue?
Q3: How might query expansion techniques be applied here?
Q4: What are the limitations of purely lexical matching in this scenario?
