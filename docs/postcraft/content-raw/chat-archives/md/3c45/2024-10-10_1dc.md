I'd like you to be innovative in the field of knowledge storage and retrieval (for search, question answering, creative generation  etc). The problem to address is that of "unknown unknowns". 
You have four tasks, please think deeply about each, using your knowledge of existing knowledge representation approaches, and be creative about imagining new ways of using them. 
 
Task 1. Create a better, generalized description of the kind of problem described here that would be clearer to a knowledge engineer : A big document corpus on natural foods has been analyzed and stored in a vector dB, search implemented using nearest neighbour. A user asks "why is maple syrup considered the bee's knees?", with the slang  "bee's knees" in the sense of "best thing". The corpus contained information on maple syrup and bees, but not the slang, so the search returns information about honey.
Aspects of this relate to the phrases "searching for a needle in a haystack" and "for want of a nail".

Task 2. Currently at my disposal are three systems that each support knowledge representation, storage and retrieval. A vector dB as above, a graph knowledgebase using the rdf model with a sparql interface and a gpt llm. The LLM contains a massive amount of general knowledge, the vector dB and sparql store contain knowledge derived from the natural foods corpus. How might these three be used in concert to solve the problems contained in task 1.?

Task 3. What knowledge representation systems might be added to the three of Task 2, to potentially increase utility? Consider existing ones and also please imagine any new ones that might help. Only consider their operation at a high conceptual level, just enough to provide some requirements specifications, we can work on implementation details later.

Task 4. Synthesize all your thoughts on the preceding tasks and suggest how an integrated, unified system might be developed, including support for new knowledge representation systems.
