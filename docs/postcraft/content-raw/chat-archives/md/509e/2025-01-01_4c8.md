 I'll address each question, building on the documentation we've created:

For Q1 about basic usage, let's create a practical example:

<antThinking>A code example artifact would be valuable to show the practical implementation of semem. This should be comprehensive yet straightforward enough for new users.</antThinking>
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



For Q2 regarding configuration, here's a detailed guide:
```

```



For Q3 about the memory retrieval algorithm:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```





For Q4 about troubleshooting:
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isn’t yet supported on mobile.
```



These documents together provide a comprehensive guide to understanding, using, and troubleshooting semem. Let me know if you need clarification on any specific aspect.

Q1: Would you like more details about the memory decay and reinforcement mechanisms?
Q2: Should we explore the SPARQL integration in more depth?
Q3: Would you like to see how to implement custom storage backends?
Q4: Should we discuss the concept extraction and graph building process?
