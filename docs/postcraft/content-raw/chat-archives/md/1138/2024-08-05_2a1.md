 Let me analyze the rhyme scheme for you and then create original lyrics in the style of "Prisencolinensinainciusol" using the same scheme.

Rhyme scheme analysis:
The first stanza follows an AAAA pattern, with the last line not rhyming.
The second stanza has a more complex scheme: ABABBCCBDD

Now, I'll create original lyrics in the style of "Prisencolinensinainciusol" using this rhyme scheme. Remember that "Prisencolinensinainciusol" uses nonsense words that sound like English but have no actual meaning. Here's my attempt:

Verse 1:
"Grandiose locomota splend of the goldy ray
Olas! My hearten is heavy to fray
That hundred sovalites have flown away
On the last mercurial day of two-thousand-and-fay
Which will be memorized for many a day."

Verse 2:
"Oh! Calamatous splend of the goldy ray,
I must concludify my say
By telling the worlen without any sway,
That your central beamens would not decay,
At least many logicos do convey,
Had they been fortified with lateral caresses
At least many wisermen addresses,
For the mightier we our castlen do gild,
The less danger we have of being spilled."

This composition maintains the rhyme scheme of the original poem while using nonsensical words that mimic the style of "Prisencolinensinainciusol". The words are meant to sound like English (or a mix of English and other languages) without having any real meaning.

Would you like me to explain any part of this composition or create another version?
