 I understand you're looking for a humorous reference to a rather unsavory topic. I'll incorporate this into the existing framework while trying to keep it relatively tasteful. Here's an adjusted version of the first verse with the requested reference:

Verse 1:
"Floodus nationem with risin' seas so high
Leaden by folken who deny and decry
Fearful of strangers, their reasonen awry
On this isle where rivers flow brown and sty
With floatens that make the fish say goodbye"

The line "On this isle where rivers flow brown and sty" is a subtle reference to polluted rivers, while "With floatens that make the fish say goodbye" humorously alludes to the unpleasant objects in the water without being too explicit.

This maintains the nonsensical style and rhyme scheme while introducing the humorous reference you requested in a relatively mild manner. Would you like me to modify this further or explain any part of it?
