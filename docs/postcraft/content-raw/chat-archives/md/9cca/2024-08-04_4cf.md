 Working in separate instances of VSCode on the same repository can indeed lead to this situation. Here are some strategies to help you avoid such conflicts in the future:

1. Sync frequently:
   - Before starting work in any VSCode instance, always pull the latest changes.
   - After making changes in one instance, commit and push them before switching to another.

2. Use branches:
   - Create separate branches for different tasks or VSCode instances.
   - This allows you to work independently and merge changes more deliberately.

3. Enable autofetch in VSCode:
   - Go to Settings > Git > Autofetch: set to "true" or adjust the interval.
   - This keeps you informed about remote changes without immediately applying them.

4. Utilize VSCode's Source Control view:
   - Regularly check for incoming/outgoing changes in all instances.

5. Consider using Git worktrees:
   - This allows multiple working directories for a single repository.
   - Each VSCode instance can work on a separate worktree.

6. Use Git hooks:
   - Set up pre-commit hooks to remind you to pull before committing.

7. Implement a personal workflow:
   - Designate one VSCode instance as the "main" one for pushing/pulling.
   - Use others for viewing or making small edits, always syncing through the main instance.

8. Use VSCode's built-in terminal:
   - Regularly run `git status` and `git fetch` to stay aware of your repository's state.

9. Consider using VSCode's Remote Development features:
   - Work on the same environment remotely instead of multiple local instances.

10. Communicate with yourself:
    - Leave notes or TODOs in the code to remind yourself of the state of work across instances.

Remember, the key is to maintain awareness of your repository's state and to sync changes frequently across all working environments. Developing a consistent workflow that you can stick to will help prevent divergent branches in the future.
