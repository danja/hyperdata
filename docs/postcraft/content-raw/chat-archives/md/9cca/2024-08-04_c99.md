 Based on the image, it appears you're experiencing issues with the SSH service on your system. Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

1. The `systemctl status sshd` command shows that the `sshd.service` unit could not be found.

2. However, `systemctl status ssh` shows that the SSH service exists, but it's in a failed state. The service is loaded but disabled, and it failed to start with an exit code.

3. You attempted to enable the SSH service with `systemctl enable ssh`, which required authentication.

4. After authentication, there was an error: "update-rc.d: error: Permission Denied"

This suggests that there might be permission issues preventing the service from being enabled or started properly. Here are some steps you could try:

1. Ensure you have sufficient permissions. Try prefixing the commands with `sudo`:
   ```
   sudo systemctl enable ssh
   sudo systemctl start ssh
   ```

2. Check the SSH configuration file for any errors:
   ```
   sudo sshd -t
   ```
   This will test the configuration without actually starting the service.

3. Check the system logs for more detailed error messages:
   ```
   sudo journalctl -u ssh
   ```

4. Verify the permissions of the SSH configuration files:
   ```
   ls -l /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
   It should be owned by root and have permissions 644.

5. If all else fails, you might need to reinstall the SSH server:
   ```
   sudo apt-get remove --purge openssh-server
   sudo apt-get install openssh-server
   ```

Remember to be cautious when working with SSH, especially if you're connected remotely, as you might lock yourself out. Always have a backup method to access the system if possible.
