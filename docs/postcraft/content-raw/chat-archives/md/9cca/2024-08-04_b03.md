 The error message and the process list you've provided indicate that there's a mismatch between the service name and the actual running process. This situation is common when the SSH service name differs between distributions or when the system is using a different init system. Here's what we can deduce:

1. The error message suggests that the system doesn't recognize `sshd.service`, which is the typical systemd service name for SSH.

2. However, the `ps` command shows that `sshd` processes are indeed running on your system.

This could mean one of a few things:

1. Your system might not be using systemd, but another init system like SysV init.
2. The SSH service might be named differently on your system.

To resolve this, try the following steps:

1. Check if you're using systemd:
   ```
   ps -p 1
   ```
   If the output shows "systemd", you're using systemd.

2. If you're using systemd, try to find the correct service name:
   ```
   systemctl list-units | grep ssh
   ```
   This might show you the correct name of the SSH service.

3. If you're not using systemd, you might need to use the appropriate command for your init system. For example, with SysV init:
   ```
   service ssh restart
   ```
   or
   ```
   /etc/init.d/ssh restart
   ```

4. You can also try to find the init script:
   ```
   ls /etc/init.d/ | grep ssh
   ```

5. If all else fails, you can manually restart the SSH daemon:
   ```
   killall sshd
   /usr/sbin/sshd
   ```
   (Be careful with this approach, especially if you're connected via SSH, as it might disconnect you)

Remember to be cautious when restarting SSH services, especially if you're connected remotely, as you might lose your connection. Always have a backup method to access the system if possible.
