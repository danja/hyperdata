 Certainly. I'll create a glossary of key terms that might be less familiar to a lay reader, including new concepts like "cognitive proprioception".

<antThinking>A glossary is an excellent candidate for an artifact. It's substantial, self-contained, and likely to be referenced multiple times. I'll create a new artifact for this glossary.</antThinking>

# Glossary of Key Terms in Consciousness and Cognition

## Proprioception
The body's ability to sense its own position, movement, and actions without visual input. Often called the "sixth sense."

## Cognitive Proprioception
The mind's ability to monitor and sense its own thoughts, emotions, and mental processes. This includes self-reflection and metacognition.

## Metacognition
Thinking about one's own thinking. The ability to reflect on, understand, and control one's learning and thought processes.

## Default Mode Network (DMN)
A network of interacting brain regions that is active when a person is not focused on the outside world, often associated with daydreaming, self-reflection, and thinking about others.

## Theory of Mind
The ability to attribute mental states â€” beliefs, intents, desires, emotions, knowledge, etc. â€” to oneself and others, and to understand that others have beliefs, desires, intentions, and perspectives different from one's own.

## Interoception
The sense of the internal state of the body. This includes the perception of physical sensations related to internal organ function, such as respiration, heartbeat, satiety, and the autonomic nervous system.

## Embodied Cognition
The theory that many features of cognition are shaped by aspects of the entire body. It emphasizes the role that the body plays in shaping the mind.

## Meme
An idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture. Analogous to a gene in that it self-replicates, mutates, and responds to selective pressures.

## Emergent Property
A characteristic of a system that results from the interactions of its parts, not inherent in or predictable from the properties of the individual parts.

## AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
A hypothetical type of intelligent computer system that would have the ability to understand, learn, and apply its intelligence to solve any problem, much like a human can.

## Behaviorism
A systematic approach to understanding behavior that focuses on observable behaviors and how they are affected by the environment, rather than internal mental states.

## Predictive Processing
A theory of brain function which proposes that the brain constantly generates and updates a model of the world to predict and explain sensory inputs.

## Mirror Neurons
A type of brain cell that fires both when an animal acts and when it observes the same action performed by another, thus "mirroring" the behavior of the other.

## Narrative Identity
The internalized, evolving story of the self that a person creates to provide their life with unity, purpose, and meaning.

## Extended Mind Theory
The idea that the mind extends beyond the skull, incorporating tools, technologies, and even other people into its cognitive processes.

I've created a glossary artifact that defines key terms related to consciousness and cognition, including the new concept of "cognitive proprioception". This glossary should help lay readers better understand the concepts discussed in our previous exchanges.

The definitions are written in plain language, avoiding jargon where possible, and providing relatable examples or analogies where appropriate. This should make the complex topics we've discussed more accessible to a general audience.

Is there anything in the glossary you'd like me to expand on or clarify further?
