 Let me address each follow-up question:

1. Marble release mechanism:
A rotating notched disk at the top controls timing, with electromagnetic pins holding marbles until release points. Variable notch spacing enables rhythm control.

2. Acoustic materials:
Metal alloy resonator bars (like traditional music box tines) provide optimal sustain and clarity. Bronze or brass plates would offer warm tones with good projection.

3. Multiple marble harmonies:
Yes - parallel tracks could be precisely synchronized. Different track angles would allow marbles to intersect at calculated points for planned harmonies.

4. Reset system:
An internal lift mechanism activated by winding the base. Spiral channels guide marbles upward, sorting them by color into starting chambers.

q1: How would you prevent unwanted resonance between components?
q2: Could the design incorporate variable speeds for tempo control?
q3: What would be the maximum practical number of simultaneous notes?
q4: How could digital controls enhance the mechanical system?
