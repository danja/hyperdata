 I acknowledge the need for a fresh non-marble mechanism.

Solution summaries:
- Replaced marbles with floating magnetic rings
- Created levitating note triggers using electromagnets
- Developed 3D holographic score display
- Implemented contactless sound generation

The redesigned concept uses electromagnetically levitated rings that rotate in three dimensions. As each ring passes through laser detection gates, it triggers specific notes. The rings' height, rotation speed, and orientation encode musical information. A central holographic display shows the current score position using ring positions.

q1: How could temperature changes affect the electromagnetic levitation precision?
q2: What sampling rate would be needed for accurate note triggering?
q3: Could the rings be programmed to create visual patterns synchronized with the music?
q4: How would power consumption be optimized for longer play times?
