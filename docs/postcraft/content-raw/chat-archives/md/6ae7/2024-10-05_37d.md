 To list recent push calls made to a remote server, you can use the `git reflog` command. Here's how you can do it:

<antThinking>This request is for a specific Git command and its usage, which is relatively brief and doesn't require a separate artifact. Keeping it in the conversation flow will make it easier for the user to follow up with questions.</antThinking>

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to your Git repository.

3. Run the following command:

   ```
   git reflog show origin/main
   ```

   Replace `main` with the name of your branch if it's different.

This command will show you the reflog for the remote branch, which includes push operations. Each entry will have a timestamp, allowing you to see when the pushes occurred.

If you want to see more detailed information about the pushes, including the commit messages, you can use:

```
git log origin/main -p
```

Again, replace `main` with your branch name if necessary.

These commands will show you the recent changes pushed to the remote server. Is there any specific information about the pushes you're looking for?
