I'd like a way of writing similar to Lewis Carroll's technigue for writing at night, but for toki pona. I'd like to know your thoughts on how to make a good combination of alphabet characters, parts of words and words and if useful, phrases that would be both simple to learn and efficient in use. Ultimately it would be good to make easy  mappings between this and attempto controlled english and logic languages like prolog and description logics. Use html and svg to render images.
