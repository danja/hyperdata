 I've analyzed the problem and identified key components for a solution. I'll now break down the problem into steps and carry out each task.

1. Identify resource allocation issues in the YAML file.
2. Determine options for overriding resource demands.
3. Propose a solution to modify the YAML file.
4. Provide steps to implement the solution.

Solution summary:
The error is due to CPU resource allocation exceeding available resources. To resolve this, we need to modify the YAML file to reduce CPU demands. This can be done by editing the file directly or using environment variables for overrides.

Here's a brief description of the solution:
1. Edit the YAML file to reduce CPU limits and reservations.
2. Use environment variables to override CPU allocations.
3. Remove CPU specifications entirely if fine-grained control isn't necessary.

q1: What are the specific services with CPU allocations exceeding the available resources?
q2: How can we use environment variables to override resource allocations in Docker Compose?
q3: What are the trade-offs of removing CPU specifications versus reducing them?
q4: Are there any services that could be combined or removed to reduce overall resource usage?
