 Acknowledged. Analysis complete.

Based on geological periods before turtles (which first appeared in the Late Triassic):
- Pre-Paleozoic Era (Hadean/Archaean): "The Primordial Epoch"
- Early Paleozoic: "The Ancestral Times"
- Key focus on Permian period: "The Pre-Chelonian Age"

Most fitting term: "The Pre-Chelonian Era" - technically accurate while maintaining antediluvian style.

q1: How did early reptilian evolution lead to turtle development?
q2: What other major species emerged in the Pre-Chelonian Era?
q3: What geological conditions characterized this period?
q4: Are there any transitional fossils between pre-turtle and turtle species?
