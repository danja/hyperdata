 In UK English slang, "tasty" can have a few different meanings beyond its literal sense of something being delicious:

1. Attractive or good-looking: It's often used to describe an attractive person, especially in a somewhat casual or cheeky way. For example, "That new bartender is pretty tasty!"

2. Impressive or excellent: It can be used to describe something that's particularly good or impressive. For instance, "Did you see his new car? It's a tasty little number!"

3. Difficult or challenging: In some contexts, particularly related to sports or confrontations, "tasty" can mean tough or potentially violent. For example, "The match is going to be tasty - the two teams really don't like each other."

4. Expensive or high-quality: Sometimes it's used to describe something that's of high value or quality. "He's got a tasty job in the City" might mean a well-paying job in London's financial district.

5. Risky or dangerous: In certain contexts, it might describe a situation that's potentially hazardous or tricky. "Things got a bit tasty when the police showed up at the party."

The exact meaning often depends on the context in which it's used. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these uses or provide more examples?
