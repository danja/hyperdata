 Let me help you understand inheritance laws in this situation. First though, I should ask: Do you currently have a valid will? This would significantly affect how your estate would be distributed.

If you don't have a will, your estate would be subject to intestacy rules. Since you have both UK citizenship and Italian residency, this creates an interesting cross-border inheritance situation governed by the EU Succession Regulation (Brussels IV) and UK inheritance laws.

For EU residents (including Italy), the default position is that the law of your country of habitual residence applies to your entire estate - both movable property (like money, investments) and immovable property (real estate). So Italian succession law would likely apply to most of your estate.

Under Italian inheritance law, in the absence of a will and with only a father and brother as close relatives:
- Your father, as a parent, would be entitled to inherit most of your estate
- Your brother would have inheritance rights only if your father disclaimed his inheritance

However, UK property (if you own any) may be treated differently since the UK didn't opt into Brussels IV. UK assets would likely follow UK intestacy rules.

Would you like me to explain more about any specific aspect of this situation? For instance, we could discuss making a will to ensure your wishes are followed, or look deeper into how specific types of assets would be handled.
