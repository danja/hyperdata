 In that case, I'd strongly recommend making a will for two key reasons:

1. Simplicity: Without a will, your heirs would need to navigate both Italian and UK bureaucracy to prove their inheritance rights. Italian inheritance procedures can be particularly complex and time-consuming, often requiring multiple visits to notaries and translations of documents. A clear will would significantly streamline this process.

2. Tax Optimization: Both Italy and the UK have inheritance taxes, but with proper planning you can minimize the tax burden:

- In Italy, direct relatives (including parents and siblings) benefit from generous tax allowances. Each heir gets a â‚¬1 million exemption, with only 4% tax on amounts above that.
- Property transfers specifically have additional complexities in Italy, involving local notaries and registration requirements.

A practical solution could be:
- Make a will in Italy (since that's where your main asset is)
- Have it drafted by a notary in Italian, with an English translation
- Clearly specify your chosen heir(s)
- Consider including a "living will" section about funeral arrangements to prevent any confusion
- Include details of all bank accounts and assets to make them easier to locate

Would you like me to explain more about the specific process of making a will in Italy or about inheritance tax optimization strategies?
