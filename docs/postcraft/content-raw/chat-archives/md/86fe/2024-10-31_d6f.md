 I'll brainstorm some nicknames that capture different aspects of this advisor's role and personality while maintaining professionalism and British sensibilities.

1. "The Portfolio Whisperer"
- Captures their ability to make sense of scattered work
- Plays on their gentle approach
- Slightly humorous but still professional

2. "The Tech Tailor"
- Suggests customized solutions
- Implies craftsmanship and attention to detail
- Links to British tradition of bespoke services

3. "The Code Cartographer"
- References their ability to map out scattered projects
- Suggests exploration and discovery
- Has a nice alliterative quality

4. "The Digital Sherpa"
- Implies guidance through complex terrain
- Suggests supportive rather than directive leadership
- Memorable and slightly playful

5. "The Neurotech Navigator"
- Directly references work with neurodivergent technologists
- Suggests helping find direction
- More serious but still memorable

6. "The Scattered Sage"
- Playfully acknowledges working with scattered projects
- Implies wisdom while being slightly self-deprecating
- Has a nice alliterative quality

My personal favorite would be "The Portfolio Whisperer" as it:
- Is immediately understandable
- Has a touch of humor without being silly
- Captures both the technical and gentle aspects of the role
- Works well in a British context
- Suggests expertise without being boastful

Would you like me to explore any other directions for the nickname, perhaps emphasizing different aspects of the advisor's role?
