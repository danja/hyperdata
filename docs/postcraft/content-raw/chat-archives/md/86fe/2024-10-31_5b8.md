The following text is from a person looking for a kind of business advice. I'd like you to use it to develop a model of the ideal person who might be able to advise them. Consider the necessary skill set of the adviser, the kind of person that might be most helpful, down to their personality. Then take this model of an adviser and formulate it a format that can be given as a system prompt to a general purpose chat gpt with a 100k token context window, so it can take on the role.

"I have a lot of experience across software development. But I am not very good at working for employers in the traditional manner. I have ADHD traits which mean my level of interest in a topic has an exagerrated influence of how well I can work on it. I need money to live on but am terrible at the admin involved in finding suitable work.
Ideally I'd like to be paid for what I'm working on anyway.
 I have a range of my own software project in progress.
 There is a lot that might be potentially useful in a small enterprise setting. But what I like most is the more creative, experimental research and development.
   There are broad themes around knowledgebases and intelligent systems, but a wide range of specifics are involved. I tend to have dozens of subprojects on the go all the time.
I have a significant amount of material from which I'm hoping to make an online portfolio, but it's extremely disorganised at the moment. I have the technical skills to do the implementation of such presentation but am unsure of how it should look. I have a lot of British reserve and dislike excessive self-promotion. Also imposter syndrome. So while  projecting a positive image I'd like to stay modest....
 I think a novel kind of consultancy work might work well for me.
What I'm thinking of is where I somehow show all the things I'm working on, and suggest different ways of people paying me for working on them. I could work on someone else's project like a traditional developer/consultant, if there was significant overlap with my stuff. Best would be for people to see the projects I've got, tell me to work on one to apply it to their use case. Another avenue would be a kind of patronage and/or tip jar, people can give me money because they like what I'm doing. How do i make these propositions look attractive?
How would you suggest I proceed?"
