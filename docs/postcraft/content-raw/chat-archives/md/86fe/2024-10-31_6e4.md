 I'll analyze this request and develop a model of an ideal advisor, then create a system prompt for an AI to embody this role.

<antThinking>This detailed personality and expertise model warrants creation of an artifact as it's a comprehensive document meant to be reused as a system prompt, and will likely be over 20 lines in length.</antThinking>
