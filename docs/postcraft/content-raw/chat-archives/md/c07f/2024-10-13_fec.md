 JavaScript supports lambdas through its arrow function syntax and anonymous functions. Let me explain how this works and then discuss how we might map these to JSON structures.

1. JavaScript Lambdas

JavaScript supports lambdas in two main ways:

a) Arrow functions (introduced in ES6):
```javascript
const square = x => x * x;
```

b) Anonymous functions:
```javascript
const square = function(x) { return x * x; };
```

Both of these are ways to create function objects without naming them, which is the essence of lambda expressions.

2. Mapping Lambdas to JSON Structures

JSON doesn't directly support functions, as it's a data serialization format. However, we can represent the structure of a lambda in JSON and then use that representation to reconstruct the function in JavaScript. Here's an approach:

<antThinking>This explanation involves a substantial code example that demonstrates a complete system for representing and reconstructing lambda functions. It's self-contained, likely to be reused or modified, and represents a standalone piece of work. This makes it a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>

<antArtifact identifier="lambda-to-json" type="application/vnd.ant.code" language="javascript" title="Lambda to JSON Converter">
// Convert a lambda to a JSON representation
function lambdaToJson(fn) {
  return {
    params: fn.toString().match(/(?<=\().*(?=\))/)[0].split(',').map(p => p.trim()),
    body: fn.toString().match(/(?<=\{).*(?=\})/)[0].trim()
  };
}

// Reconstruct a lambda from its JSON representation
function jsonToLambda(json) {
  return new Function(...json.params, `return ${json.body}`);
}

// Example usage
const originalLambda = (x, y) => x * y + 5;
const jsonRepresentation = lambdaToJson(originalLambda);
console.log('JSON representation:', JSON.stringify(jsonRepresentation, null, 2));

const reconstructedLambda = jsonToLambda(jsonRepresentation);
console.log('Reconstructed lambda result:', reconstructedLambda(3, 4));
</antArtifact>

This system works as follows:

1. `lambdaToJson` function:
   - Converts a lambda function to a JSON-serializable object.
   - It extracts the parameters and function body using regex.

2. `jsonToLambda` function:
   - Reconstructs a lambda function from its JSON representation.
   - It uses the `Function` constructor to create a new function.

3. The example demonstrates converting a lambda to JSON and back.

This approach has some limitations:
- It only works for simple lambdas.
- It doesn't preserve closure information.
- It uses `eval`-like functionality (the `Function` constructor), which can be a security risk if used with untrusted data.

For more complex scenarios or when security is a concern, you might consider alternatives like serializing the entire logic of your application and using a safe subset of JavaScript that can be parsed and executed in a controlled environment.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation or provide more examples of how this could be used in practice?
