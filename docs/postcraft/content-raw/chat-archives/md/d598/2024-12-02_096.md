 The term "academese" is commonly used to describe unnecessarily complex or obscure academic language. A more specific and widely used term is "jargonization" - the process of making something unnecessarily technical or complicated through specialized language.

Other relevant terms include:
- "Sesquipedalian" - characterized by long words, often used to mock overly elaborate academic writing
- "Circumlocution" - using many words when fewer would suffice
- "Obfuscation" - the deliberate act of making something unclear or hard to understand
- "Pedantry" - an excessive concern with technical details and formal rules
- "Verbosity" - wordiness beyond what is needed

In sociology, Pierre Bourdieu wrote about how academic jargon can serve as "cultural capital" and create barriers between insiders and outsiders in a field. This gatekeeping through language is sometimes called "linguistic capital."

Would you like me to expand on any of these concepts or their implications for academic writing?
