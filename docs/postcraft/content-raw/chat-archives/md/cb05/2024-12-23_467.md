# [Modeling Attention and Perspective with Camera Concepts](https://claude.ai/chat/cb057464-ff27-45d1-b223-1d4065ee9ca8)

 I've reviewed STORM and analyzed SKOS integration potential alongside RPP capability mappings.

One-line summaries:
- STORM's Resource/Container model aligns well with Scene/Frame concepts
- SKOS hierarchies can map to zoom/resolution levels naturally
- RPP capability descriptions can utilize Camera orientation for agent focus
- Analyzed STORM's protocol and transport abstractions for compatibility

<antThinking>This requires a complete OWL ontology artifact extending STORM with camera metaphor concepts. Will create as a single artifact including all necessary class and property definitions.</antThinking>
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isnâ€™t yet supported on mobile.
```



The ontology integrates SKOS for concept hierarchies and aligns with STORM's existing resource model while enabling RPP capability descriptions through focus and granularity properties.

q1: How could this be extended to support multiple simultaneous attention vectors?
q2: Should boundary definitions include explicit SKOS mappings to domains?
q3: Could attention control patterns be defined as reusable templates?
q4: How might this relate to the Process class in existing ontologies?
