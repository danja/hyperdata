 Based on the project files, particularly the RPP (RDF Process Profile) and IBIS vocabularies, I'll analyze the agent goal-setting integration.

One-line summaries:
- RPP capabilities match well with AttentionControl patterns
- IBIS positions can represent attention targeting goals
- W6 vocabulary's "why" dimension aligns with focus intent
- Storm protocols provide the infrastructure for goal communication

Solution:
Extend the STORM ontology with goal-setting properties that connect AttentionControl to RPP capabilities and IBIS positions. This allows agents to:
- Declare attention goals using IBIS positions
- Link attention patterns to RPP process profiles
- Use W6 predicates to explain focus choices
- Track goal achievement through STORM resources
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isnâ€™t yet supported on mobile.

q1: How should goal achievement metrics be defined?
q2: Could attention goals form hierarchical structures?
q3: How might competing goals be prioritized?
q4: What role should consensus play in multi-agent attention goals?
