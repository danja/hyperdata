I'm trying to find terms and their descriptions to capture a set of ideas to use in knowledge engineering and project management. Call the main notion a "Camera". The general idea is about the attention given to a subject matter in various conceptual dimensions. I want to use the terms in project management. Drawing on the photographic camera, the pan and tilt can offer an analogy for a general direction or vector in the information space, but those words aren't quite right. "Zoom" is great for the notion of changing the level of knowledge granularity, similar to to the abstract pyramid of data, information, knowledge, wisdom. But somehow expressed more concretely, so it can be applied to specific practical projects. Something along the lines of "Scene" is needed, to give the context. But the word "Camera" already carries this meaning in its Latin etymology : room. In practice I want to use constructs expressing containership of collections, probably named graphs best for that. These could be ontologies, document collections, datasets and vector stores (possibly using the Data Cube (qb) Vocabulary) or suchlike. What do you suggest for crystalizing this? rh and check for concurrencies and interop potential with the existing vocabularies in your project knowledge and elsewhere.
