 I have analyzed the requirements for a vocabulary to model attention and perspective in knowledge engineering using camera metaphors, and reviewed the provided files.

One-line summaries of tasks completed:
- Examined camera terminology for conceptual mapping potential
- Analyzed spatial and perspective aspects in existing ontologies
- Evaluated container hierarchies in RDF named graphs
- Assessed integration with existing vocabularies like IBIS, W6, and Dublin Core

Solution:
Create an ontology with core classes Camera (attention controller), Frame (bounded view), Vector (direction+magnitude), and Resolution (detail level). Use named graphs for scenes/contexts. Integrate with Dublin Core for basic metadata, W6 for perspective aspects, and IBIS for reasoning chains.

Example term mappings:
- Camera -> :AttentionControl 
- Frame -> :InformationBoundary
- Vector -> :DirectionalFocus 
- Resolution -> :DetailGranularity
- Scene -> :NamedGraphContext

q1: Should the ontology include explicit temporal aspects for capturing attention evolution?
q2: How could vector stores be integrated using the Data Cube vocabulary?
q3: What role could SKOS play in managing different levels of conceptual abstraction?
q4: How might this integrate with agent capability descriptions in the RPP vocabulary?
