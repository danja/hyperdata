 To identify bottlenecks in existing code like Transmissions, you can follow these steps:

1. Profiling: Use Node.js built-in profiling tools or third-party profilers to measure execution time of different parts of the code.

2. Logging: Add strategic logging statements to track execution time of key functions or operations.

3. Analyze async operations: Look for areas where asynchronous operations might be causing delays.

4. Memory usage: Monitor memory consumption to identify potential memory leaks or excessive memory usage.

5. Database queries: If applicable, examine database query performance and optimization opportunities.

6. Code review: Manually inspect the code for inefficient algorithms or unnecessary operations.

7. Load testing: Simulate high loads to identify scalability issues.

8. Use performance monitoring tools: Implement tools like New Relic or Datadog for continuous performance monitoring.

Q1: What specific Node.js profiling tools would be most effective for analyzing Transmissions?
Q2: How can we implement efficient logging without significantly impacting performance?
Q3: Are there any common bottlenecks typically found in pipeline-based architectures like Transmissions?
