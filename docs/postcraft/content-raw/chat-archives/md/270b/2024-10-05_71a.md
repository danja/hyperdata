 Q1: Specific Node.js profiling tools effective for analyzing Transmissions:

1. Node.js built-in profiler: Use --prof flag to generate V8 profiler output
2. clinic.js: Provides CPU, memory, and I/O profiling with visual output
3. 0x: Flame graph profiler for Node.js, useful for identifying hot code paths
4. v8-profiler-next: Programmatically control V8 profiler for targeted analysis

Q2: Implementing efficient logging without significantly impacting performance:

1. Use asynchronous logging libraries like pino or winston
2. Implement log levels and configure appropriately in different environments
3. Use sampling for high-volume log events
4. Employ buffering and batching for log writes
5. Consider using a centralized logging service for offloading processing

Q3: Common bottlenecks in pipeline-based architectures like Transmissions:

1. Serial processing: Slow stages bottleneck entire pipeline
2. Memory management: Inefficient data passing between stages
3. I/O operations: Blocking I/O in any stage affects overall throughput
4. Event loop blocking: Long-running synchronous operations
5. Improper error handling: Unhandled errors breaking the pipeline flow

Q1: How can we integrate profiling tools directly into the Transmissions codebase for continuous monitoring?
Q2: What strategies can be employed to optimize memory usage in a pipeline architecture?
Q3: How might we implement parallel processing in Transmissions to alleviate bottlenecks?
