 In systems like package.json and .gitignore, where files and directories are filtered according to include and exclude lists, there are some common conventions for how the rules are applied. Here's an overview:

1. Order of precedence:
   - Generally, more specific rules take precedence over more general rules.
   - Later rules usually override earlier rules.

2. Pattern matching:
   - Asterisk (*) matches any number of characters except slashes.
   - Double asterisk (**) matches any number of characters including slashes.
   - Question mark (?) matches a single character except a slash.
   - Square brackets ([abc]) match any one character inside the brackets.

3. Directory indicators:
   - A slash (/) at the end of a pattern indicates a directory.
   - A slash at the beginning of a pattern indicates the root of the project.

4. Negation:
   - An exclamation mark (!) at the beginning of a pattern negates it, meaning "don't ignore" in .gitignore or "do include" in package.json.

5. Comments:
   - Lines starting with # are treated as comments.

6. Empty lines:
   - Empty lines are ignored.

7. Case sensitivity:
   - Patterns are usually case-sensitive, but this can depend on the operating system.

Here's how these conventions typically apply in .gitignore and package.json:

.gitignore:
- Each line specifies a pattern for files or directories to ignore.
- Negation with ! can be used to explicitly include files that would otherwise be ignored.

package.json (in the "files" field):
- Specifies which files should be included when the package is published.
- If not specified, it defaults to including all files except those ignored by .gitignore.
- The "files" field acts as a whitelist, while .npmignore (if present) acts as a blacklist.

It's worth noting that while these conventions are common, the exact behavior can vary between different systems and tools. For the most accurate information, it's always best to consult the specific documentation for the tool you're using.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these conventions?
