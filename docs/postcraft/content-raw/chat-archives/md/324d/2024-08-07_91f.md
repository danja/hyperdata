 The order of application between blacklists and whitelists can vary depending on the specific system, but there's a general principle that's commonly followed:

1. Blacklist (exclude) is typically applied first.
2. Whitelist (include) is then applied to the remaining set.

This order is logical because:

1. First, you remove everything you don't want (blacklist).
2. Then, from what's left, you specify what you do want (whitelist).

However, it's important to note some specifics:

1. In .gitignore:
   - It's primarily a blacklist system.
   - The ! (negation) acts as a kind of whitelist within the blacklist.
   - Rules are processed top to bottom, with later rules overriding earlier ones.

2. In package.json:
   - The "files" field acts as a whitelist.
   - If both package.json "files" and .npmignore exist, .npmignore is applied first (as a blacklist), then the "files" whitelist is applied.

3. Some systems might apply whitelist first, then blacklist. This is less common but does exist in some specialized scenarios.

The exact behavior can depend on the specific tool or system you're using. For critical applications, it's always best to test the behavior or consult the official documentation of the specific tool you're working with.

Would you like me to elaborate on how this works in any particular system?
