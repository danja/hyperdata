 Thank you for providing that updated information about ARC2. It's great to hear that the project is still actively maintained and has progressed to version 3.1.0. The move to PHP 8 only is indeed a significant change.

Regarding PHP 8, yes, I'm familiar with it. PHP 8 was a major update to the PHP language, introducing several new features and improvements. Here are some key points about PHP 8:

1. JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation: This can provide performance improvements for certain types of applications.

2. Union Types: Allows for more precise type declarations.

3. Named Arguments: Improves code readability and flexibility when calling functions.

4. Attributes: Provides a native way to add metadata to classes, without relying on docblock annotations.

5. Match Expression: A more powerful and expressive version of the switch statement.

6. Nullsafe Operator: Simplifies null checks in method calls.

7. Improved Type System: Including mixed type, static return type, and more.

8. Constructor Property Promotion: Simplifies the declaration of class properties.

9. Improved Error Handling: With consistent error messages and exceptions.

The shift to PHP 8 only for ARC2 3.x likely allows the project to take advantage of these new features and optimizations. It also means that users of ARC2 3.x will need to ensure their WordPress installation (and server) supports PHP 8.

For a WordPress site looking to use ARC2 3.x, this would mean:

1. Ensuring the web server runs PHP 8.0 or later.
2. Verifying that WordPress itself is compatible with PHP 8 (which it should be for recent versions).
3. Checking that all other plugins and themes are PHP 8 compatible.

Would you like more information on any specific aspect of PHP 8 or how it might affect using ARC2 with WordPress?
