 I'll need to provide some context about my knowledge cutoff and the nature of software versioning before answering your question about the most recent version of ARC2.

My knowledge cutoff is in April 2024, so I can confidently speak about versions released up to that point. However, software projects, especially open-source ones like ARC2, can release new versions frequently. 

As of my last update, the most recent stable version of ARC2 I'm aware of was version 2.5.1. This version was released on October 11, 2021. 

However, I want to emphasize that there could have been newer releases since then that I'm not aware of. The best way to get the most up-to-date information would be to check the official ARC2 GitHub repository or its release page.

If you're considering using ARC2 for a project, I'd recommend verifying this information and checking for any more recent releases or important updates. Software versioning can change rapidly, and it's always best to use the most recent stable version for security and feature improvements.

Would you like me to provide more information about ARC2 2.5.1 or discuss how to check for the most current version?
