I'd like to explore ways of running progressive web apps inside the pulsar environment. Do you know of any existing examples of this being done? I like the idea of being able to develop the app in the same environment, with live updates/continual integration. The apps should be capable of running standalone in a regular browser or on a mobile device, with an independent http server providing various facilities in a loosely-coupled fashion, using a variety of http methods to enable read/write operations. When used within the pulsar environment, the server could provide hooks, 2-way connectors to the facilities in the rest of pulsar. Can you please think about this, identify the concrete requirements and give me a plan for building an initial proof of concept that implements all these features.
