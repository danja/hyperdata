A project pivot is here defined as a kind of milestone or landmark date by which certain tasks should have been done. There is a strong analogy with a mechanical pivot, it's a point at which a change of direction may be called for. The project today is a software project involving software pipelines so as well as components like a an engine transmission, plumbing may be involved. Today is Halloween.
A promotional poster, like a movie poster,  is needed for this project pivot. Imagine a conceptual  notion that incorporates all the key features  you find in your project knowledge about it. Make it spooky. Now, be creative and condense all this into a description of a striking image that even the most stupid graphic designer will understand and be able to paint.
