 A dark, industrial scene dominated by a massive, rusted transmission mechanism, its gears forming a spiral that seems to pull the viewer in. At its center, a glowing pipeline pulses with ethereal data, like luminescent liquid. Victorian-era brass pipes twist around the scene, some leaking ghostly vapors of RDF triples.

The focal point is a mechanical pivot joint, crafted to resemble a Jack-o'-lantern's face, its eyes flickering with Node.js logos. Data streams flow through transparent pipes, forming a spiderweb pattern that connects different mechanical components labeled with ES module imports.

In the shadows, semi-transparent JSON objects float like spectral entities, being transformed into Markdown documents by steampunk-styled processing units. The entire scene is bathed in an eerie blue glow from multiple computer monitors showing transmission diagrams.

A banner across the bottom reads "TRANSMISSIONS: Where Data Flows Meet Dark Arts"

q1: Should we incorporate AGI-related imagery given Claude's involvement?
q2: Would adding Semantic Web iconography make it too busy?
q3: Should we emphasize the Unix pipeline inspiration more explicitly?
q4: Would a Soviet-style constructivist alternative be worth exploring?
