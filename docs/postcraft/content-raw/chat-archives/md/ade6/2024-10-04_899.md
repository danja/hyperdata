 To write the sequence C C F C D Bb in Italian sol-fa (also known as solfeggio or solfège), we use the following syllables:

Do Do Fa Do Re Sib

Here's a breakdown:

- C = Do
- F = Fa
- D = Re
- Bb = Sib (Si bemolle)

In Italian sol-fa, B-flat is called "Si bemolle", which is often abbreviated to "Sib". This differs from some other solfège systems where Bb might be called "Te" or "Ta".

It's worth noting that in fixed-do solfège systems (which is common in Italy), these syllables always correspond to the same pitches regardless of the key, unlike in movable-do systems where "Do" would be the tonic of whatever key you're in.

Would you like me to explain more about Italian solfège or how it compares to other systems?
