 In the key of C major:

English: Bb is the flattened 7th scale degree.

Italian: Sib Ã¨ il settimo grado abbassato della scala.

In both languages, we can break this down further:

English:
- Bb = B-flat
- 7th scale degree = leading tone
- Flattened = lowered by a half step

Italian:
- Sib = Si bemolle
- Settimo grado = seventh degree
- Abbassato = lowered

In the context of C major, Bb (or Sib in Italian) is a non-diatonic note, as the normal 7th degree would be B natural. The presence of Bb often implies a temporary shift to the key of F major (the subdominant of C major) or could be part of a secondary dominant chord leading to F.

Would you like me to elaborate on the function of Bb in C major or explain any other aspects of music theory in English and Italian?
