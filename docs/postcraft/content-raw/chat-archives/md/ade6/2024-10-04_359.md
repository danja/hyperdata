 Yes, the Bb in the key of C major often seeks resolution, though its exact behavior depends on the musical context. Let's explore this:

1. As part of a dominant seventh chord:
   If the Bb is part of a G7 chord (G-B-D-F), it creates tension that typically resolves to C. In this case, the Bb (as the 7th of the chord) would resolve downward to A.

2. In a secondary dominant:
   Bb might be part of a C7 chord (C-E-G-Bb), functioning as V7/IV. This would typically resolve to F major, with the Bb moving to A.

3. In modal mixture:
   Bb could be borrowed from the parallel minor (C minor), often moving to A or G.

4. As part of a Neapolitan chord:
   In a Db major chord (Db-F-Ab), the Bb would typically resolve upward to B natural.

In Italian, we might describe this tendency as:

"Il Sib cerca spesso una risoluzione, tipicamente muovendosi verso il La o il Si naturale, a seconda del contesto armonico."

(The Bb often seeks resolution, typically moving to A or B natural, depending on the harmonic context.)

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these resolutions or discuss how they might be used in a composition?
