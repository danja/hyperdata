 Let me revise the prompt to be even more precise and literal for the AI:

"Create a single panel comic-style illustration with a vertical thermometer gauge on the left side, mounted with two gray metal brackets. The background is cream colored. From top to bottom, show exactly five positions of a black and white cat:
1. Top: Cat completely limp and elongated, drooping over an invisible shelf
2. Second: Cat stretched out but alert, triangular ears visible, tail extended straight
3. Middle: Cat in sphinx position, sitting upright with curved tail
4. Fourth: Cat curled in a C-shape, eyes closed
5. Bottom: Cat compressed into a perfect circle shape

The thermometer should have a red mercury column and bulb. Each cat should be simple line art but clearly showing black and white fur patches. Title below reads 'THERMOMETER FOR CAT OWNERS' in capital letters. Everything should be drawn with clean, simple black lines in a minimalist cartoon style."

q1: Should we specify exactly where the black and white patches should be on the cat?
q2: Would you like to add specific temperature markers on the thermometer?
q3: Should we make the mounting brackets more or less prominent?
q4: Should we add a slight shadow under each cat position?
