 Thank you for sharing the image. Here's a detailed DALL-E prompt crafted to recreate this with a black and white cat:

"A minimalist illustration of a thermometer diagram showing cat behavior at different temperatures. Five stages showing a black and white cat: At the top, the cat is completely stretched out and melting like liquid; below that, the cat is lounging with tail extended; middle shows the cat sitting alertly with tail curved; fourth position shows the cat in a tight curled sleeping position; bottom shows the cat as a perfect circle. Simple line art style with pale yellow background, black frame lines, and a red thermometer on the left with mounting brackets. Clean, cartoon style with simple lines but maintaining photorealistic cat textures."

q1: Would you like to adjust the level of detail in the cat's fur texture?
q2: Should we specify the exact temperature markings on the thermometer?
q3: Would you like to modify the background color from pale yellow?
q4: Should we add whiskers or other fine details to make the cat more distinctive?
