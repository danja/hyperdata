 Here's a concise summary:

RDF Process Profile (RPP) is a lightweight XML-based specification from 2001 that describes processes using RDF (Resource Description Framework). It aims to standardize how data processors are described, moving away from data-centric approaches toward resource-centric ones. RPP allows both online and offline processes to be represented as web resources, with descriptions of all required resources needed to carry out data processing. The specification includes a vocabulary of classes (like Profile, Component, Algorithm) and properties (like location, availability, input/output) that can be used to describe processes. RPP is designed to be extensible and can serve as a foundation for more sophisticated layers of process description, potentially enabling automated process discovery and execution.
