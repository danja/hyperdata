 This error indicates that the PyQt5.sip module is missing. This is a common issue when working with PyQt5. Here's how you can resolve it:

1. First, try reinstalling PyQt5 with pip:

```
pip uninstall PyQt5
pip install PyQt5
```

2. If that doesn't work, you might need to install PyQt5-sip separately:

```
pip install PyQt5-sip
```

3. If you're still having issues, you can try installing both packages together:

```
pip install PyQt5 PyQt5-sip
```

4. In some cases, you might need to install the system-level Qt dependencies. On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can do this with:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5.sip
```

5. If you're using a virtual environment, make sure you've activated it before running these commands.

6. As a last resort, you could try uninstalling and reinstalling all related packages:

```
pip uninstall PyQt5 PyQt5-sip
pip install PyQt5 PyQt5-sip
```

After trying these steps, run your script again and see if the error is resolved. If you're still encountering issues, please let me know and I can provide further assistance.
