 It seems you're encountering an issue while trying to clone the REAL-Video-Enhancer repository from GitHub. The error message suggests that the connection is being closed prematurely, possibly due to network issues or server-side problems. Here are a few things you can try to resolve this:

1. Increase the buffer size and timeout:
```
git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
git config --global http.lowSpeedLimit 0
git config --global http.lowSpeedTime 999999
```

2. Try a shallow clone first:
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/TNTwise/REAL-Video-Enhancer.git
```
After this completes, you can fetch the rest of the history:
```
cd REAL-Video-Enhancer
git fetch --unshallow
```

3. Use Git Large File Storage (LFS) if the repository uses it:
```
git lfs clone https://github.com/TNTwise/REAL-Video-Enhancer.git
```

4. Try cloning with SSH instead of HTTPS (if you have SSH set up with GitHub):
```
git clone git@github.com:TNTwise/REAL-Video-Enhancer.git
```

5. If possible, try from a different network or use a VPN.

6. As a last resort, you could try downloading the ZIP file of the repository from GitHub's web interface and then initializing it as a Git repository locally.

If none of these solutions work, the issue might be on GitHub's side, and you may need to wait and try again later.

Would you like me to explain any of these solutions in more detail?
