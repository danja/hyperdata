Ok, I know how to do the DNS A records and certs.  I don't understand what the role of "container internal DNS with custom network bridge" would be or how to "Implement service discovery pattern". I see the value in "separate dev/prod compose files" but haven't really got a clue how to do this with Docker. Where would the environment variables live? I would like to keep things as simple as possible, in particular so that colleagues that aren't familiar with network admin and docker can easily set up and use instances of tbox. 
Taking all this into consideration, alongside what I have already,  can you please provide me with a proposal for the system architecture, with enough description for me to get an idea of how the components fit together. Render this proposal as an artifact. Then please create a second artifact containing step-by-step instructions for me to follow to implement the proposed system.
