 I'll help create an abstract and outline for "Semantic Web++" that builds on these historical perspectives while incorporating recent technological developments. Let me start with the abstract:

<antThinking>This is a good candidate for an artifact as it's a structured academic document that will likely be referenced or modified, and will be longer than 20 lines.</antThinking>
```
Viewing artifacts created via the Analysis Tool web feature preview isnâ€™t yet supported on mobile.
```



I've created an abstract and detailed outline for "Semantic Web++". The article positions itself as a bridge between the original Semantic Web vision and modern AI capabilities, particularly focusing on how LLMs and related technologies have addressed many of the historical challenges faced by Semantic Web adoption.

Key aspects I've highlighted include:
- The integration of flexible LLM-based understanding with formal semantic structures
- The role of modern infrastructure in enabling practical semantic systems
- How intelligent agents and natural language interfaces have made semantic technology more accessible
- The balance between formal semantics and practical utility

Would you like me to expand on any particular section or adjust the focus of certain areas?
