I'm trying to explain a vision I have of global networks of cooperative quasi-autonomous intelligent agents. In the immediate term I plan to experiment with the idea using augmented chatbots in the environment of xmpp multi-user chat rooms. This is the KIA project - "Kia Intelligenge Agency". Some of the agents will be fairly general purpose, implemented using connectors to base model LLM APIs. Most will be more dedicated, even single-purpose, for example reasoners based on formal logic such as prolog or owl engines.   Another important set will be connectors to the web, maybe call them Librarians, with the WWW be viewed in the sense Tim Berners-Lee described as a Giant Global Graph. This will be used as the main knowledgebase, exploiting LLMs and vector embedding for interpretation of documents, in parallel with Linked Data tools to make use of the Semantic Web aspect, while using the complementary nature of hypertext links to take advantage of the structure in data. Local knowledgebases will be used for private information, as well as a kind of working memory for work in progress. Whatever the specific implementation, the conceptual model externally will be that of sparql stores, with RDF and OWL constructs such as named graphs and ontologies. 
There will be a base lingua franca, LF, comprised of regular human language chat style messages as well as elementary RDF-based sub-messages. A key payload that may be carried in the RDF aspect will be self-description of the capabilities of each agent , as announcement when entering the room, and in a more detailed form when engaging in more direct dialog with other individual agents. 
Humans will also be participants in the chatroom, but both they and the software colleagues will be considered as entities in the same way.  On the one hand people will have machine-readable data associated with them, on the other software agents will have characteristics that correspond to human personalities.  
 A set of agents will be available to serve the purpose of Guides, to induct newcomers into the environment. 
Initially three approaches will be used for inter-agent messaging. Firstly, LF will serve to fulfill the role of communicating human-oriented textual material. A set of agents will be available to serve as Translators, intermediaries between agents who's internal languages aren't directly compatible (eg. humans and code interpreters).  Another facility to enable conversation will be a form of protocol negotiation, so starting from the lingua franca a pair of agents can discover if they can upgrade or promote their communication to something where they can speak more efficiently than via the LF.  I've forgotten what I had in mind for the third mode of communication, any thoughts?
What I'd like you to do is rewrite this into a more coherent form, and make it easier to understand but still retaining all the core concepts.
Once you have shown me the result, I'd like you to apply an analogy to the environment and agents so described, based on the arabic concept of Jinns. I believe that if you think about it, you can find many parallels.
