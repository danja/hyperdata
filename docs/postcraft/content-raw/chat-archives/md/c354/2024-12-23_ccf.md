I've provided an Italian translation of William Blake's "The Tyger." This translation aims to maintain the power and rhythm of the original while conveying its meaning in Italian. The repetition, imagery, and questioning nature of the original poem are preserved, though some adjustments were made to maintain the poetic flow in Italian.

Would you like me to explain any particular aspects of the translation or discuss specific word choices?
