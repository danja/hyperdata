 Before Git became widely popular, one of the most prominent online version control systems was SourceForge, which primarily used Subversion (SVN) as its version control system.

SourceForge, launched in 1999, was a web-based platform that provided free hosting for open-source software projects. It offered Subversion repositories as one of its main features, allowing developers to collaborate on projects, manage source code, and track changes over time.

Subversion itself was created in 2000 by CollabNet Inc. as an improvement over the older CVS (Concurrent Versions System). While Subversion could be used with various hosting solutions, SourceForge's popularity made it one of the most widely used online platforms for Subversion repositories in the pre-Git era.

It's worth noting that there were other platforms and self-hosted solutions for Subversion as well, but SourceForge was particularly well-known and widely used in the open-source community before Git and platforms like GitHub gained prominence in the late 2000s and early 2010s.
