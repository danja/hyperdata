 It appears you're encountering an error while trying to clone the 'hyperdata-static' repository from GitHub. The error message suggests there was a problem with the network connection during the cloning process. Here's a breakdown of what's happening and some potential solutions:

1. The cloning process started successfully and began enumerating objects.
2. An RPC (Remote Procedure Call) failure occurred, specifically a curl error 92.
3. The connection was unexpectedly terminated before all the data was received.

This error can occur due to various reasons, including:
- Unstable network connection
- Firewall or antivirus interference
- GitHub server issues
- Large repository size

Here are some steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Retry the clone operation:
   Sometimes, simply trying again can work if it was a temporary network issue.

2. Use a shallow clone:
   ```
   git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-static.git
   ```
   This will only fetch the most recent commit, which can help if the repository is large.

3. Increase the buffer size:
   ```
   git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
   ```
   Then try cloning again.

4. Use Git LFS if the repository uses large files:
   ```
   git lfs clone https://github.com/danja/hyperdata-static.git
   ```

5. Check your network connection and try on a different network if possible.

6. Temporarily disable your firewall or antivirus to see if they're interfering.

7. If the problem persists, you can try downloading the repository as a ZIP file from the GitHub website as an alternative.

If none of these solutions work, the issue might be on GitHub's end, in which case you may want to wait a while and try again later, or contact GitHub support if the problem continues.

Would you like me to explain any of these solutions in more detail?
