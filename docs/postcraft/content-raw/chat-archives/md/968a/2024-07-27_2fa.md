 This error indicates that Node.js is unable to find the 'rdf-ext' package that is being imported in your TransmissionBuilder.js file. This typically occurs when the package is not installed or not properly linked in your project. Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

1. Make sure 'rdf-ext' is listed in your package.json:
   Open your package.json file and check if 'rdf-ext' is listed under "dependencies" or "devDependencies".

2. If it's not in package.json, install it:
   ```
   npm install rdf-ext
   ```

3. If it is in package.json, try reinstalling all dependencies:
   ```
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

4. Check if you're using ES modules:
   If your package.json has `"type": "module"`, or if you're using `import` instead of `require`, make sure your import statement is correct:
   ```javascript
   import rdfExt from 'rdf-ext';
   ```
   Or if you're importing specific parts:
   ```javascript
   import { someFunction } from 'rdf-ext';
   ```

5. Verify Node.js version:
   Some packages require a specific Node.js version. Check if your Node.js version meets the requirements of 'rdf-ext'.

6. Check for path issues:
   Ensure that the path in the error message is correct and that TransmissionBuilder.js is where you expect it to be.

7. If you're using a monorepo or a complex project structure, make sure your Node.js module resolution is set up correctly.

If none of these steps solve the problem, there might be an issue with how the 'rdf-ext' package is published or with your Node.js setup. In that case, you might want to:

- Check the 'rdf-ext' documentation for any special installation instructions.
- Look for any GitHub issues related to this problem on the 'rdf-ext' repository.
- Try creating a minimal reproduction of the problem and seek help from the 'rdf-ext' maintainers or the Node.js community.

Would you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail?
