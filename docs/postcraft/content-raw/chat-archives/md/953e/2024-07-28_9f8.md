 I apologize for the persisting issue. The error suggests that the Baseline class is still not being recognized properly. Let's try a few more troubleshooting steps:

1. Verify the file structure:
   Ensure that your repository has the following structure:
   ```
   StoneRDF/
     BaselineOfStoneRDF.package/
       BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st
   ```

2. Check the .filetree file:
   In the BaselineOfStoneRDF.package directory, create or update a .filetree file with the following content:
   ```json
   {"packageExtension" : ".package",
   "propertyFileExtension" : ".json" }
   ```

3. Update the Metacello loading script:
   Try specifying the exact package location:
   ```smalltalk
   Metacello new
     baseline: 'StoneRDF';
     repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main/BaselineOfStoneRDF.package';
     load.
   ```

4. Clear Metacello cache:
   Before trying to load again, run this in a Playground:
   ```smalltalk
   Metacello resetSystemCache
   ```

5. Manually load the Baseline:
   If the above doesn't work, try manually loading the Baseline class:
   ```smalltalk
   "First, ensure the repository is cloned locally"
   Iceberg enableMetacelloIntegration: true.
   Iceberg remoteTypeSelector: #httpsUrl.
   Metacello new
     baseline: 'StoneRDF';
     repository: 'gitlocal:///path/to/your/local/StoneRDF';
     load.
   ```
   Replace '/path/to/your/local/StoneRDF' with the actual path to your locally cloned repository.

6. Check for conflicting packages:
   Look in your Pharo image for any existing packages or classes that might conflict with 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'.

Q1: After trying these steps, are you able to see the BaselineOfStoneRDF class in your Pharo System Browser?

Q2: Can you confirm that the BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st file is being correctly read from your repository by Metacello?

Q3: Have you tried loading this baseline in a fresh Pharo image to rule out any potential conflicts with existing code in your current image?
