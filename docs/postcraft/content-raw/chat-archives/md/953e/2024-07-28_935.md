 Thank you for providing that information. Let's adjust the Metacello loading script to use your correct GitHub username:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
    baseline: 'StoneRDF';
    repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';
    load.
```

This script assumes that:
1. Your GitHub username is 'danja'
2. The repository name is 'StoneRDF'
3. The main branch is called 'main'

If any of these assumptions are incorrect, please adjust the script accordingly. For example, if your main branch is called 'master' instead of 'main', you would change ':main' to ':master'.

Now, to address the original error:

1. Ensure that the BaselineOfStoneRDF class is defined in your project. It should be in a file named 'BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st' in the 'BaselineOfStoneRDF.package' directory.

2. Double-check that this file is committed to your GitHub repository and is in the correct branch.

3. Verify that the class name in the file matches exactly: it should be 'BaselineOfStoneRDF', not 'BaselineOfStoneRdf' or any other variation.

4. Make sure the Baseline class is a subclass of BaselineOf, like this:

```smalltalk
BaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF
    instanceVariableNames: ''
    classVariableNames: ''
    package: 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'
```

5. Ensure that the baseline: method is correctly defined:

```smalltalk
BaselineOfStoneRDF >> baseline: spec
    <baseline>
    spec for: #common do: [
        "Your project structure definition here"
    ]
```

After making these checks and any necessary corrections, try loading the project again using the Metacello script provided at the beginning of this response.

Q1: Can you confirm that the BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st file exists in your GitHub repository and that it's in the correct location?

Q2: Have you recently made any changes to the repository structure or the Baseline class that might explain this error?

Q3: Are you able to browse the BaselineOfStoneRDF class in your Pharo image after attempting to load it, even if it fails?
