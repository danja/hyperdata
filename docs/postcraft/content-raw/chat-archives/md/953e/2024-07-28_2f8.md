 The error message "Error: project, baseline, or configuration not specified" suggests that the Metacello script you're trying to execute is missing some crucial information. This typically happens when the Metacello new method is not properly configured before attempting to load or execute an action.

Let's address this issue step by step:

1. First, ensure you're using the correct Metacello script. It should look something like this:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'StoneRDF';
  repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';
  load.
```

2. If you're certain that this is the script you're using, try breaking it down into separate steps to identify where the error is occurring:

```smalltalk
| metacello |
metacello := Metacello new.
Transcript show: 'Created Metacello instance'; cr.

metacello baseline: 'StoneRDF'.
Transcript show: 'Set baseline'; cr.

metacello repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main'.
Transcript show: 'Set repository'; cr.

metacello load.
Transcript show: 'Attempted to load'; cr.
```

Execute this in a Playground and check the Transcript after each step to see which one fails.

3. If the error persists, try explicitly specifying the project:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
  project: 'StoneRDF';
  baseline: 'StoneRDF';
  repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';
  load.
```

4. Verify that your repository structure is correct. The baseline file should be at:
   `StoneRDF/BaselineOfStoneRDF.package/BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st`

5. If you're still having issues, try clearing Metacello's cache and trying again:

```smalltalk
Metacello resetSystemCache.
```

Then run your loading script again.

Q1: Which step in the broken-down script (if you tried it) fails?

Q2: Can you confirm that your GitHub repository is public and accessible?

Q3: Have you tried loading any other projects using Metacello recently, and if so, were they successful?
