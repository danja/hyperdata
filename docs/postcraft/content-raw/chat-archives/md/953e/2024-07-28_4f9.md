 The error message indicates that the key 'BaselineOfStoneRDF' was not found in the Dictionary. This suggests that the Baseline class for the StoneRDF project is either not properly defined or not loaded into the Pharo image.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the BaselineOfStoneRDF class is correctly defined and loaded. Here are the steps to fix this:

1. Check if the BaselineOfStoneRDF class exists in your project. It should be defined in a separate package, typically named 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'.

2. If the class doesn't exist, create it with the following basic structure:

```smalltalk
BaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF
    instanceVariableNames: ''
    classVariableNames: ''
    package: 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'

BaselineOfStoneRDF >> baseline: spec
    <baseline>
    spec for: #common do: [
        "Define your project structure here"
        spec 
            package: 'StoneRDF-Core';
            package: 'StoneRDF-Tests' with: [ spec requires: #('StoneRDF-Core') ].
        spec 
            group: 'default' with: #('Core' 'Tests');
            group: 'Core' with: #('StoneRDF-Core');
            group: 'Tests' with: #('StoneRDF-Tests')
    ]
```

3. Make sure this Baseline class is committed to your repository.

4. Update your Metacello loading script to use the correct repository URL and branch:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
    baseline: 'StoneRDF';
    repository: 'github://yourusername/StoneRDF:main';
    load.
```

Replace 'yourusername' with your actual GitHub username and 'main' with the appropriate branch name if different.

5. Try loading the project again using this updated Metacello script.

If you've followed these steps and are still encountering issues, you may need to debug the Metacello loading process or check for any other dependency conflicts in your Pharo image.

Q1: How can I verify that the BaselineOfStoneRDF class is correctly loaded in my Pharo image?

Q2: What are some common mistakes in defining a Baseline class that could lead to this error?

Q3: How can I use the Pharo tools to inspect and debug the Metacello loading process if I'm still having issues?
