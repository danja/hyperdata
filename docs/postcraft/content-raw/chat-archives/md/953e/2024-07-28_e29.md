 Thank you for providing that information. The fact that you can fetch the baseline file content directly from GitHub is a good sign. It confirms that the file exists and is accessible. Now let's try to understand why Metacello is having trouble loading it.

Given this information, here are a few things we can try:

1. First, let's ensure that the baseline class is properly formatted. Copy the content you received in the Transcript and save it directly into your Pharo image. You can do this by executing the following in a Playground:

```smalltalk
| baselineContents |
baselineContents := 'BaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF
    instanceVariableNames: ''''
    classVariableNames: ''''
    package: ''BaselineOfStoneRDF''

{ #category : #baselines }
BaselineOfStoneRDF >> baseline: spec [
    <baseline>
    spec for: #common do: [
        "Define your project structure here"
        spec 
            package: ''StoneRDF-Core'';
            package: ''StoneRDF-Tests'' with: [ spec requires: #(''StoneRDF-Core'') ].
        spec 
            group: ''default'' with: #(''Core'' ''Tests'');
            group: ''Core'' with: #(''StoneRDF-Core'');
            group: ''Tests'' with: #(''StoneRDF-Tests'')
    ]
]'.

OpalCompiler new
    source: baselineContents;
    evaluate.
```

2. After executing this, try loading your project again:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'StoneRDF';
  repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';
  load.
```

3. If you're still encountering issues, it's possible that Metacello is having trouble with the repository URL. Let's try specifying the exact location of the baseline:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'StoneRDF';
  repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main/BaselineOfStoneRDF.package';
  load.
```

4. If none of the above work, there might be an issue with the project structure. Ensure that your GitHub repository has the following structure:

```
StoneRDF/
  BaselineOfStoneRDF.package/
    BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st
  StoneRDF-Core.package/
    (your core classes here)
  StoneRDF-Tests.package/
    (your test classes here)
```

Q1: After manually adding the baseline class to your image, are you able to browse it in the System Browser?

Q2: When you try to load the project after manually adding the baseline class, do you get a different error message?

Q3: Can you confirm that your GitHub repository structure matches the one described in step 4?
