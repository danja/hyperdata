 I apologize for the confusion. I see that the image is still showing the incorrect syntax. Let's fix this step-by-step:

1. First, clear your Playground completely.

2. Now, copy and paste the following code into your Playground:

```smalltalk
BaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF
	instanceVariableNames: ''
	classVariableNames: ''
	package: 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'.

BaselineOfStoneRDF compile: 'baseline: spec
	<baseline>
	spec for: #common do: [
		"Define your project structure here"
		spec 
			package: ''StoneRDF-Core'';
			package: ''StoneRDF-Tests'' with: [ spec requires: #(''StoneRDF-Core'') ].
		spec 
			group: ''default'' with: #(''Core'' ''Tests'');
			group: ''Core'' with: #(''StoneRDF-Core'');
			group: ''Tests'' with: #(''StoneRDF-Tests'')
	]'.
```

3. Select all of this code and execute it (Cmd+D or Ctrl+D, or right-click and select "Do it").

4. After executing, try to browse the class to ensure it's properly defined:

```smalltalk
BaselineOfStoneRDF browse
```

5. If the class is now properly defined, try loading your project:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'StoneRDF';
  repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';
  load.
```

This approach defines the class and then compiles the method separately, which should avoid any syntax issues in the Playground.

Q1: After executing this new code, are you able to browse the BaselineOfStoneRDF class without errors?

Q2: Does the baseline: method appear correctly when you browse the class?

Q3: When you try to load the project after these changes, what happens? Does it load successfully or do you get an error message?
