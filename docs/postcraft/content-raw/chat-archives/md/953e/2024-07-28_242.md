 I apologize for not clarifying that. The Transcript is a tool window in Pharo that might not be immediately visible. Here's how to find and open it:

1. In the Pharo window, look at the top menu bar.

2. Click on "Tools" in the menu bar.

3. In the dropdown menu, select "Transcript".

Alternatively, you can use the following keyboard shortcut:

- On Windows/Linux: Ctrl + O + T
- On macOS: Cmd + O + T

If the Transcript window was already open but not visible, these steps will bring it to the foreground.

Once you've opened the Transcript, you should see the output from the code you executed. If you don't see any output, you may need to run the code again.

Remember, you can also clear the Transcript at any time by right-clicking inside it and selecting "Clear" from the context menu, or by executing `Transcript clear` in a Playground.

Q1: Were you able to locate and open the Transcript window?

Q2: Do you see any output in the Transcript after running the diagnostic code?

Q3: If you're seeing output, does it match the expected format I described earlier, or is it different?
