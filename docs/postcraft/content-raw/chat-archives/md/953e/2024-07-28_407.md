 The error message you're seeing indicates a syntax error in the baseline definition. Specifically, it's complaining about an unexpected end of statement after "BaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF". This suggests that there's an issue with how the class definition is formatted. Let's correct this:

1. Here's a properly formatted version of your baseline class. Copy this entire block and execute it in a Playground:

```smalltalk
BaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF
	instanceVariableNames: ''
	classVariableNames: ''
	package: 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'.

BaselineOfStoneRDF >> baseline: spec [
	<baseline>
	spec for: #common do: [
		"Define your project structure here"
		spec 
			package: 'StoneRDF-Core';
			package: 'StoneRDF-Tests' with: [ spec requires: #('StoneRDF-Core') ].
		spec 
			group: 'default' with: #('Core' 'Tests');
			group: 'Core' with: #('StoneRDF-Core');
			group: 'Tests' with: #('StoneRDF-Tests')
	]
]
```

2. After executing this, check if the BaselineOfStoneRDF class is now properly defined in your image. You can do this by trying to browse the class:

```smalltalk
BaselineOfStoneRDF browse
```

3. If the class is now properly defined, try loading your project again:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'StoneRDF';
  repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';
  load.
```

4. If you're still encountering issues, it's possible that there's a problem with the project structure or the contents of the packages referenced in the baseline. Ensure that your GitHub repository contains the 'StoneRDF-Core' and 'StoneRDF-Tests' packages, and that they contain valid Smalltalk code.

Q1: After executing the corrected baseline class definition, are you able to browse the BaselineOfStoneRDF class without errors?

Q2: When you try to load the project after correcting the baseline class, do you get a different error message or does it load successfully?

Q3: Can you confirm that your GitHub repository contains the 'StoneRDF-Core' and 'StoneRDF-Tests' packages, and that they contain valid Smalltalk code?
