 I see the issue now. The BaselineOfStoneRDF class doesn't exist yet in your Pharo image, which is why you're getting this prompt. Let's create the class first, then define its method. Here's how to do it step by step:

1. In your Playground, clear everything and paste this code:

```smalltalk
BaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF
    instanceVariableNames: ''
    classVariableNames: ''
    package: 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'.
```

2. Select this code and execute it (Cmd+D or Ctrl+D, or right-click and select "Do it").

3. Now that the class is created, let's define the baseline method. Add this code to your Playground (you can keep the previous code):

```smalltalk
BaselineOfStoneRDF compile: 'baseline: spec
    <baseline>
    spec for: #common do: [
        "Define your project structure here"
        spec 
            package: ''StoneRDF-Core'';
            package: ''StoneRDF-Tests'' with: [ spec requires: #(''StoneRDF-Core'') ].
        spec 
            group: ''default'' with: #(''Core'' ''Tests'');
            group: ''Core'' with: #(''StoneRDF-Core'');
            group: ''Tests'' with: #(''StoneRDF-Tests'')
    ]'.
```

4. Select this new code and execute it.

5. Now, let's verify that the class and method are correctly defined:

```smalltalk
BaselineOfStoneRDF browse.
```

Execute this line to open the class browser for BaselineOfStoneRDF.

6. If everything looks correct in the class browser, try loading your project:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'StoneRDF';
  repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';
  load.
```

Execute this to attempt loading your project.

Q1: Were you able to create the BaselineOfStoneRDF class without errors?

Q2: After defining the baseline method, can you see it correctly in the class browser?

Q3: What happens when you try to load the project using the Metacello script? Do you get any error messages?
