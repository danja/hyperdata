 Thank you for that information. An empty Transcript and the error message you're seeing indicate that the code is still failing to execute properly due to the 'BaselineOfStoneRDF' key not being found. This suggests that Metacello is unable to locate or load your baseline class. Let's try to diagnose this further:

1. First, let's verify that Metacello can access your repository. Run this code in a Playground:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
    repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';
    get.
```

2. If that doesn't produce an error, let's try to manually load the baseline file:

```smalltalk
FileStream readOnlyFileNamed: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main/BaselineOfStoneRDF.package/BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st' do: [:stream |
    Transcript clear;
        show: stream contents;
        cr].
```

3. If both of these fail, there might be an issue with how Metacello is configured to access GitHub. Try running:

```smalltalk
Iceberg remoteTypeSelector: #httpsUrl.
```

Then attempt to load your baseline again.

4. If you're still encountering issues, let's try to load the repository using Iceberg directly:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
    baseline: 'StoneRDF';
    repository: 'gitlocal:///path/to/your/local/StoneRDF';
    load.
```

Replace '/path/to/your/local/StoneRDF' with the actual path to your locally cloned repository.

5. If none of these work, there might be an issue with the baseline file itself or its location in the repository. Double-check that:
   - The file is named exactly 'BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st'
   - It's located in a folder named 'BaselineOfStoneRDF.package'
   - This package folder is in the root of your repository

Q1: Which of these steps were you able to complete successfully, and which ones resulted in errors?

Q2: Can you confirm that you can see the 'BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st' file in your GitHub repository through a web browser?

Q3: Have you tried cloning your repository locally and loading it from the local copy to rule out any GitHub access issues?
