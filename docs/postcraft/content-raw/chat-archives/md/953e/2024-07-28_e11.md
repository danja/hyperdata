 Thank you for providing that detailed feedback. It seems the error occurs when trying to execute the `load` command. This suggests that the baseline and repository are being set correctly, but there's an issue when Metacello tries to actually load the project. Let's investigate further:

1. First, let's try to get more information about what Metacello is seeing. Replace the `load` command with `get` and run this script:

```smalltalk
| metacello |
metacello := Metacello new.
metacello baseline: 'StoneRDF'.
metacello repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main'.
metacello get.
```

This should attempt to fetch the project information without actually loading it.

2. If that doesn't provide more insight, let's try to manually locate and load the baseline file:

```smalltalk
| baselineContents |
baselineContents := (ZnClient new
    url: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danja/StoneRDF/main/BaselineOfStoneRDF.package/BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st';
    get) contents.
Transcript clear; show: baselineContents; cr.
```

This will attempt to directly fetch the baseline file from GitHub and display its contents in the Transcript.

3. If both of these fail, there might be an issue with how Metacello is configured to access GitHub. Try running:

```smalltalk
Iceberg remoteTypeSelector: #httpsUrl.
```

Then attempt to load your baseline again.

4. If you're still encountering issues, let's try to load a known working baseline to rule out any issues with your Pharo image or Metacello installation:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
  baseline: 'PetitParser';
  repository: 'github://moosetechnology/PetitParser/src';
  load.
```

Q1: What output do you see when you try to use the `get` command instead of `load`?

Q2: Are you able to manually fetch and view the contents of your baseline file using the ZnClient script provided?

Q3: Does the attempt to load PetitParser (or another known working baseline) succeed where your project fails?
