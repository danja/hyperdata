 Thank you for providing the content of your BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st file. The baseline definition looks correct, but there are a couple of minor issues that need to be addressed:

1. The class definition and the method definition should be separated by an empty line or a comment line for better readability and to ensure proper parsing.

2. The method definition is missing the square brackets that should enclose the method body.

Here's the corrected version of your BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st file:

```smalltalk
BaselineOf subclass: #BaselineOfStoneRDF
    instanceVariableNames: ''
    classVariableNames: ''
    package: 'BaselineOfStoneRDF'

{ #category : #baselines }
BaselineOfStoneRDF >> baseline: spec [
    <baseline>
    spec for: #common do: [
        "Define your project structure here"
        spec 
            package: 'StoneRDF-Core';
            package: 'StoneRDF-Tests' with: [ spec requires: #('StoneRDF-Core') ].
        spec 
            group: 'default' with: #('Core' 'Tests');
            group: 'Core' with: #('StoneRDF-Core');
            group: 'Tests' with: #('StoneRDF-Tests')
    ]
]
```

Make these changes to your BaselineOfStoneRDF.class.st file, commit them to your repository, and then try loading the project again using the Metacello script:

```smalltalk
Metacello new
    baseline: 'StoneRDF';
    repository: 'github://danja/StoneRDF:main';
    load.
```

This should resolve the "KeyNotFound: key 'BaselineOfStoneRDF' not found in Dictionary" error you were experiencing.

Q1: After making these changes and committing them, are you able to successfully load the project without errors?

Q2: Do you have the StoneRDF-Core and StoneRDF-Tests packages in your repository, as referenced in the baseline?

Q3: Have you considered using a continuous integration service like GitHub Actions to automatically test your baseline and project loading on each commit?
