# [Transmission Spawning Capabilities in Repopack](https://claude.ai/chat/f32a82e8-1031-4fe0-9d8d-8dfc40d0bdff)

 I have analyzed the provided files and key concepts around transmission spawning capabilities.

1. Located relevant code in repopack-transmissions under TransmissionBuilder.js
2. Found modular loading system with ModuleLoader.js
3. Identified WorkerPool.js implementation for parallel processing
4. Noted integration points in Processor.js base class

Summary: The codebase has core components needed for transmission spawning through the WorkerPool class and module loading infrastructure, but the feature appears incomplete. The most promising approach would be to extend the existing WorkerPool.js implementation to handle sub-transmission creation and lifecycle management.

q1: Should we complete the WorkerPool implementation for handling sub-transmissions?
q2: Would it be better to implement transmission spawning at the Processor level instead?
q3: How should spawned transmission messaging be integrated with the parent transmission?
q4: What configuration format would best describe sub-transmission relationships?
