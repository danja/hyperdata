    Act as an academic research expert. Draft a comprehensive research paper outline on "Sociological aspects of Fake News in Current Affairs". The outline should be well-structured, starting with a compelling introduction that states the problem or question, the relevance of the topic, and the objectives of the research. It should then detail the main points and subpoints, incorporating relevant literature and methods of investigation. Ensure that the proposed research is sound, innovative, and contributes to the existing body of knowledge in the field. Conclude the outline with expected results or implications, and a bibliography of primary and secondary sources. Ensure that all sources are credible and up-to-date. The final product should serve as a roadmap for drafting a full-fledged research paper.
