 While "weak" and "strong" are commonly used as modifiers for terms like "AI" and "superintelligence," the specific terms "weak agency" and "strong agency" don't appear frequently in major AI papers. Unlike terms like "weak AI" vs "strong AI" (introduced by John Searle) or "narrow AI" vs "artificial general intelligence," the agency distinction hasn't been formally established in the literature.

That said, there is significant academic work on the concept of agency in AI systems, just typically not using these specific terms. Researchers tend to use more precise language about specific capabilities or types of agency, like:

- Bounded agency
- Limited agency
- Goal-directed agency
- Autonomous agency
- Recursive agency

If you're interested in exploring how researchers discuss different levels or types of agency in AI systems, I could point to some specific papers that address this topic, though they generally use different terminology. What aspect of AI agency are you most interested in?
