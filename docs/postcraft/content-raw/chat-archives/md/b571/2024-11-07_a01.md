 I aim to be precise in discussing these terms, as they're used somewhat differently across the AI and philosophy communities. While the terms are occasionally used informally, there isn't a widely accepted formal definition of "weak agency" and "strong agency" in the academic literature.

Some researchers use "weak agency" to refer to systems that can take actions to achieve specific, pre-defined goals but lack more sophisticated capabilities like:
- Long-term planning
- Abstract reasoning about their own goals
- Ability to modify their objectives
- Understanding of their role as an agent

"Strong agency" is sometimes used to describe systems with more sophisticated capabilities like:
- Ability to set and modify their own goals
- Complex planning and metacognition
- Understanding of their own agency and role
- Ability to reason about and modify their own decision-making processes

However, I should note that this dichotomy is somewhat oversimplified, and agency likely exists on more of a spectrum. The terms are also sometimes used differently in different contexts (e.g., philosophy vs. AI development).

Would you like to explore any particular aspect of agency in more detail? I'm curious about what context you're considering these terms in.
