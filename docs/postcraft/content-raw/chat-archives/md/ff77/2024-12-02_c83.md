 Several cognitive concepts relate to this type of recognition confusion:

"Tip of the tongue phenomenon" (presque vu) comes close, but that's more about being unable to recall a known word/name.

"Context-dependent memory" might apply - you knew the characters but didn't recognize them in this different context.

The "familiarity paradox" or "partial recognition" describes when something is simultaneously familiar and unfamiliar, though these aren't formal psychological terms.

The "Baker-baker paradox" is related - it's easier to remember someone is a baker than if their surname is Baker, showing how context and meaning affect recognition.

But what you're describing seems more specific - recognizing names/references when presented normally but not recognizing them when listed as examples of a category. I don't know of a precise term for this particular cognitive quirk, though it's quite common.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these cognitive concepts?
