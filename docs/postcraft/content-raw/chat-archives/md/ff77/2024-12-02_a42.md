 Let me explain these figures:

Iago - The manipulative villain in Shakespeare's Othello who, while pretending to be Othello's trusted advisor, schemes to destroy him through lies and manipulation.

Wormtongue - From Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, he was the corrupt advisor to King Th√©oden of Rohan, who poisoned the king's mind with bad counsel while secretly serving the wizard Saruman.

Cardinal Richelieu - The powerful chief minister to French King Louis XIII (1624-1642). While an effective statesman who strengthened France, he became synonymous with cunning and political manipulation. Historical opinion is mixed - he wasn't truly evil, but his name became associated with shrewd, sometimes ruthless political maneuvering.

Sejanus - A commander of the Praetorian Guard who became the right-hand man to Roman Emperor Tiberius (early 1st century CE). He gradually accumulated immense power through intrigue, eliminating rivals, and exploiting the emperor's trust. He nearly seized power before Tiberius finally recognized the threat and had him executed.

Since you're writing for an academic context - Rasputin is indeed a great choice since his role as the "Mad Monk" advisor to Russia's Romanovs is widely known and documented.
