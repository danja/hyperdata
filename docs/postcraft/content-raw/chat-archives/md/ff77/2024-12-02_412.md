 The term you're likely thinking of is "mandate of heaven" from Chinese political philosophy, or "divine right of kings" from European tradition. Related concepts include:

"Absolutism" - rule by divine authorization
"Caesarism" - when a leader claims supreme, almost divine authority
"Cult of personality" - when a leader is portrayed as having nearly supernatural qualities

More specific theological-political terms include "theocratic rule" and "sacred kingship." In modern contexts, scholars sometimes use "political messianism" to describe leaders who position themselves as divinely chosen or destined rulers.

Would you like me to explain more about any of these concepts or their historical contexts?
