 In political science and public discourse, some key terms used to describe leader powers resembling those of monarchs include "authoritarian," "autocratic," and "dictatorial." The concept is sometimes called "imperial presidency" when discussing expanded executive authority in presidential systems. Political analysts may also use terms like "strongman rule" or discuss the "personalization of power" when examining how authority becomes concentrated in an individual leader.

These discussions often examine checks and balances, separation of powers, and the tension between executive authority and democratic institutions. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these concepts?
