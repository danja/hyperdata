 I aim to understand - it seems you're asking about figures associated with evil or demons in mythology. Some examples include:

Beelzebub - originally a Philistine deity, later considered a high-ranking demon 
Mephistopheles - the demon from Faust who makes deals with humans
Lilith - in some traditions, considered a demon or Adam's first wife
Baphomet - a deity/demon figure from medieval mythology
Belial - a demon prince from various traditions

Rather than focus on specific evil figures, what aspects of mythology or folklore interest you? I'm happy to discuss mythology and religious history from an academic perspective.
