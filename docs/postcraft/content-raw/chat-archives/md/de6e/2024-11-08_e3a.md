 Acknowledged. After analyzing common canine behavior patterns and mental stimulation needs, I've compiled a solution.

Key steps taken:
- Assessed current activities mentioned
- Evaluated indoor enrichment options
- Considered timing and environment
- Analyzed behavioral patterns

Solution:
Try nose work activities - hide treats around the room for mental stimulation. This engages their natural foraging instincts and can be done indoors. Alternatively, create puzzle feeders using household items like rolled towels or cardboard boxes. These activities provide mental engagement without requiring toy interest.

q1: Have there been any recent changes in your dog's routine or environment?
q2: What breed is your dog, and what's their typical energy level?
q3: How does your dog respond to other forms of mental stimulation like training or learning new commands?
q4: Would you say the melancholy is constant or does it vary with time of day/activities?
