I would like a term to use in the context of project management. Something akin to a milestone, but much smaller and without any deadline. A task or subtask that can be completed in a out an hour. The aim is to divide projects down to units of this kind of size, so that the worker, who may have ADHD gets satisfaction, gets a dopamine hit. I want a single word (or conjunct of other words) that captures this idea succinctly. Can you think of 30 possible terms without telling me, and then by comparing with these requirements narrow it down to a shortlist of 10. For each suggestion, provide one sentence for  how the specific term might be described in documentation.
