I'd like you to think at a high level about how a progressive web scraper may be built. It will use a pipeline, a sequence of loosely-coupled components each of which will have a single function. I have a framework for this already, it passes messages, which are json objects,  along a chain of processors, each with a primary method process(message) that returns an augmented or modified message. 
The purpose of the scraper will be to extract content and structured data from web pages. The core functionality will be, when given a URL, check the status of the page, then see if it is simple html, if so, download and process it. If it is not simple, then the URL and anything learnt about it so far will be passed to a subsequent stage. The output will be passed to a store, but the details of that is out of scope right now. There are two motivations for this approach : in use, only as much computing as necessary is used; it may be developed progressively, starting with the simplest process. Please think about what the overall topology should look like and what individual processes will be needed. Compile this into a structured doc, and render as an artifact. Also create system diagrams as separate artifacts as you think necessary.
