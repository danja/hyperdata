 I believe you may be asking about the term "pastoral care." This refers to the emotional, social, and spiritual support and guidance provided by clergy or other religious leaders to members of their congregation or community. 

Pastoral care is distinct from care provided by other professionals in that it has a religious or spiritual component, though it can encompass many types of support. It's not necessarily "against" others, but rather a specific type of care offered by religious leaders.

If this isn't what you meant, could you please clarify your question? I'd be happy to provide more information or help explain a different concept if needed.
