 Addressing all questions:

1. ESP32 ADC limitations for SDR metal detection:
- Max sampling rate: ~5 MSPS (with limitations)
- Resolution: 12-bit (non-linear)
- Input voltage range: 0-1V or 0-3.3V (selectable)
Challenges:
- Limited dynamic range
- Non-linearity requires calibration
- Noise susceptibility at high sampling rates

2. Transmit-receive synchronization in ESP32 SDR metal detector:
- Use high-resolution timer for precise timing control
- Implement phase-locked loop (PLL) in software
- Utilize ESP32's RMT (Remote Control) peripheral for accurate timing
- Employ interrupt-driven sampling for consistent timing
- Consider external clock source for improved stability

3. Advantages of phase-coherent detection in SDR metal detector:
- Improved sensitivity to small phase shifts
- Better discrimination between different metal types
- Reduced susceptibility to environmental noise
- Enhanced ability to separate closely spaced targets
- Potential for advanced signal processing techniques (e.g., quadrature demodulation)

Q1: How can the ESP32's DAC be effectively utilized in generating complex waveforms for SDR-based metal detection?
Q2: What techniques can be employed to extend the effective dynamic range of the ESP32's ADC for improved detection sensitivity?
Q3: How might multiple ESP32 modules be synchronized to create a more advanced, multi-channel SDR metal detector system?
