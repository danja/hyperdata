 Balanced coil configuration (e.g., figure-eight) vs single coil design:

Advantages of balanced coil:
1. Improved EMI rejection: Cancels out uniform external fields
2. Better depth discrimination: Sharper detection fall-off with distance
3. Reduced ground effect: Minimizes false signals from mineralized soil
4. Increased sensitivity to small targets: Due to steeper field gradient

Limitations:
1. More complex construction: Requires precise winding and matching
2. Reduced overall sensitivity: Smaller effective detection area
3. Directional sensitivity: May miss targets at certain orientations
4. Higher cost: More materials and labor-intensive manufacturing

Single coil designs are simpler and more sensitive overall, but balanced configurations offer superior noise rejection and target discrimination capabilities.

Q1: How does the balanced coil configuration affect the optimal operating frequency compared to a single coil design?
Q2: What techniques can be used to minimize the directional sensitivity of a balanced coil configuration?
Q3: How does the choice between balanced and single coil designs impact the power requirements of the metal detector?
