 Key factors for optimizing a simple magnetic absorption metal detector:

1. Frequency: 1-100 kHz range, balance between penetration and sensitivity
2. Coil diameter: Larger for depth, smaller for precision
3. Coil turns: More turns increase sensitivity but reduce frequency
4. Q factor: Higher Q increases sensitivity, achieved through coil design and circuit optimization
5. Oscillator stability: Minimize drift for consistent detection
6. Shielding: Reduce environmental interference
7. Signal processing: Amplification and filtering to improve signal-to-noise ratio

Focus on coil design and oscillator frequency for initial optimization. Experiment with different coil sizes and turn counts while adjusting frequency for best performance.

Q1: How does the skin effect impact the choice of operating frequency for pipe and cable detection?
Q2: What are the trade-offs between using a transistor-based versus an op-amp-based Colpitts oscillator for this application?
Q3: How can the detection range be improved without significantly increasing power consumption?
