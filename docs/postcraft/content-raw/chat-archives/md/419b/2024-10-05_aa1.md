 Addressing all questions, with focus on frequency, penetration, and sensitivity relationships:

1. Skin effect impact:
- Higher frequencies concentrate eddy currents near conductor surface
- Shallower penetration but increased sensitivity for small targets
- Lower frequencies penetrate deeper but reduce sensitivity

2. Transistor vs op-amp Colpitts oscillator:
- Transistor: Higher frequency capability, lower power, more temperature-sensitive
- Op-amp: Easier to implement, more stable, better for lower frequencies
- Choose based on desired frequency range and stability requirements

3. Improving detection range:
- Increase transmit power (trade-off with battery life)
- Optimize coil geometry (larger diameter for depth)
- Use multi-frequency operation to balance depth and sensitivity
- Implement advanced signal processing techniques (e.g., phase detection)

Frequency-penetration-sensitivity relations:
- Inverse relationship between penetration depth and frequency
- Direct relationship between sensitivity and frequency for small targets
- Optimal frequency balances penetration and sensitivity for target size
- Soil conditions affect optimal frequency (lower for high conductivity)

Q1: How does the choice of core material for the detector coil affect sensitivity and frequency response?
Q2: What signal processing techniques can be employed to differentiate between different types of metals?
Q3: How can temperature compensation be implemented to maintain consistent performance across varying environmental conditions?
