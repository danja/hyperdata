 Dynamic ground balance adjustment using ESP32:

1. Continuous soil monitoring:
   - Sample ground response during operation
   - Use ADC to measure amplitude and phase of received signals

2. Real-time analysis:
   - Process ground signals to determine mineralization levels
   - Identify changes in soil composition

3. Adaptive filtering:
   - Implement digital filters to cancel out ground effects
   - Dynamically adjust filter coefficients based on soil conditions

4. Automatic calibration:
   - Periodically perform ground balancing routines
   - Use ESP32's GPIO to control a motorized ground plate for physical adjustment

5. User interface:
   - Allow manual fine-tuning via buttons or touchscreen
   - Display current ground balance settings

Versatile coil setup for experimentation:

1. Modular coil system:
   - Interchangeable coils with standardized connections
   - Various sizes and configurations (round, DD, concentric, figure-8)

2. Multi-coil array:
   - Multiple small coils in a fixed arrangement
   - Software-selectable coil combinations for different detection patterns

3. Separable transmit and receive coils:
   - Independent positioning for testing different geometries
   - Allows for experimentation with mono, bi, and tri-axial configurations

4. Switchable winding taps:
   - Variable turn count for frequency and sensitivity adjustment
   - Controlled via ESP32 GPIO and analog switches

5. Shielded enclosure:
   - Removable shielding for testing EMI effects
   - Grounding options for noise reduction experiments

Q1: How can the coil system be designed to allow for easy switching between VLF and PI modes?
Q2: What methods can be used to characterize and compare the performance of different coil configurations?
Q3: How might a software-defined radio (SDR) approach using the ESP32 enhance the versatility of the metal detector design?
