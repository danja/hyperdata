 Ah, now I understand why you mentioned "hen" in your initial question. There are a few chicken-related idioms that might be what you're looking for:

1. "Chicken eye" - This isn't a common idiom, but it's sometimes used to describe poor eyesight, as chickens don't have particularly good vision.

2. "Hen's teeth" - This idiom means something very rare or scarce, as in "That kind of opportunity is as scarce as hen's teeth." (Hens don't have teeth, making this a humorous way to say something is extremely rare.)

3. "Eagle-eyed" - While not chicken-related, this is another bird-related idiom meaning very observant or having keen eyesight.

4. "Cock-eyed" - This means askew, crooked, or absurd. It can also mean having a squint or crossed eyes.

5. "Chicken-hearted" - While not related to eyes, this idiom means cowardly or easily frightened.

6. "Hen-pecked" - Also not eye-related, but it describes a man who is constantly nagged or dominated by his wife.

Is it possible you were thinking of one of these, or perhaps combining "chicken" with another eye-related idiom? If none of these fit, could you provide any more context about how the idiom is used or what it means?
