 I believe you might be referring to the idiom "a hawk eye" or "hawk-eyed." This expression means having very keen eyesight or being exceptionally observant.

The idiom comes from the fact that hawks are known for their exceptionally sharp vision, which allows them to spot prey from great distances. When used to describe a person, it suggests they are very attentive to detail or quick to notice things.

For example, you might say:
"The editor has a hawk eye for grammatical errors."
"With her hawk-eyed attention to detail, she quickly spotted the discrepancy in the financial report."

Is this the idiom you were thinking of? If not, I'd be happy to help you find the correct one if you can provide any additional details.
