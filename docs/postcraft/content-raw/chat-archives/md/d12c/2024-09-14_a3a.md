 Certainly! There are a few other idioms related to eyes or vision that might be similar to what you're thinking of. Here are some possibilities:

1. "Eagle eye" - Very similar to "hawk eye," meaning keen vision or great attention to detail.

2. "Bird's eye view" - A view from high above, giving a comprehensive perspective.

3. "Keep an eye out" - To watch carefully for something.

4. "Eyes like a lynx" - Having very sharp eyesight (less common than hawk or eagle).

5. "Eyes in the back of one's head" - The ability to perceive what's happening behind you; often used for parents or teachers who seem to know what children are doing even when not looking.

6. "Eye of the tiger" - Intense focus and determination (though this is more about attitude than vision).

7. "Bull's eye" - Hitting the exact center of a target; used metaphorically for achieving a goal precisely.

8. "Cat's eye" - Sometimes used to describe keen night vision.

If none of these seem right, could you provide any more context or information about how the idiom is used? That might help narrow it down further.
