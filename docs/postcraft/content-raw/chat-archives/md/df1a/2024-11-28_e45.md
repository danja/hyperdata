 The error you're encountering is likely due to the `FileWriter` processor not receiving the expected data to write to the output file. Let's investigate the issue and suggest a solution.

<q1>Can you check the `RunCommand` processor implementation to ensure that it is properly setting the `message.commandResult.stdout` property after executing the command?</q1>

<q2>Can you verify that the `FileWriter` processor is correctly accessing the command output from the `message` object?</q2>

<q3>Are there any additional properties or error handling in the `RunCommand` processor that could be causing the issue?</q3>

<q4>Can you review the configuration and pipeline setup in the test application to ensure that everything is wired up correctly?</q4>

To resolve the `TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]` issue, you can make the following adjustments:

1. In the `RunCommand` processor, ensure that the `message.commandResult.stdout` property is properly set after executing the command. The `executeCommand` method should return an object with the following structure:

```javascript
{
    stdout: 'command output',
    stderr: 'command errors',
    code: 0 // exit code
}
```

Make sure this object is assigned to `message.commandResult`.

2. In the `FileWriter` processor, update the `doWrite` method to check the `message.commandResult.stdout` property and use it as the content to write to the file. For example:

```javascript
async doWrite(f, content, message) {
    logger.log(' - FileWriter writing : ' + f);
    await writeFile(f, message.commandResult.stdout);
    return this.emit('message', message);
}
```

3. Review the configuration and pipeline setup in the `test_runcommand` application to ensure that the `RunCommand` and `FileWriter` processors are properly connected and that the expected command is being executed.

4. Consider adding more robust error handling in the `RunCommand` processor to gracefully handle cases where the command execution fails or returns unexpected output.

By addressing these points, you should be able to resolve the `TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]` issue and ensure that the `RunCommand` processor correctly writes the command output to the specified file.
