 HTTP/2 explicitly disallows the HTTP 1.1 Upgrade header and mechanism for a few key reasons:

1. Different negotiation mechanism: HTTP/2 uses a different method for protocol negotiation, primarily through the ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) TLS extension.

2. Performance optimization: The Upgrade mechanism in HTTP 1.1 required an additional round-trip, which HTTP/2 aims to avoid for better performance.

3. Complexity reduction: Removing the Upgrade header simplifies the protocol and reduces potential points of failure or confusion.

4. Security considerations: The new negotiation mechanism in HTTP/2 is considered more secure, as it's typically done over an encrypted TLS connection.

Replacement:
The comparable replacement for the Upgrade mechanism in HTTP/2 is primarily the use of ALPN during the TLS handshake. This allows clients and servers to negotiate the protocol version before the HTTP communication begins.

For non-TLS connections, HTTP/2 specifies the use of an HTTP/1.1 OPTIONS request with the Upgrade header set to "h2c" (HTTP/2 Cleartext). If the server supports HTTP/2, it can respond with a 101 (Switching Protocols) status and then switch to HTTP/2. However, this method is less common and not recommended for production use due to security concerns.

It's worth noting that while HTTP/2 doesn't use the Upgrade header for version negotiation, it does introduce a similar concept called "protocol error upgrade" for transitioning to newer minor versions of HTTP/2. This is done using the GOAWAY frame with specific error codes.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this explanation or provide more details on a specific aspect of HTTP/2's protocol negotiation?
