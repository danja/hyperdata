  "text": " An Italian would likely call this type of scarf a \"foulard\" (pronounced foo-LAR). \n\nThe term \"foulard\" is derived from French but is commonly used in Italian to describe a square scarf, typically made of silk or lightweight materials like cotton. It's a versatile accessory that can be worn in various ways - around the neck, as a headscarf, or even as a decorative item on bags or as a pocket square.\n\nIn some contexts, Italians might also use more general terms like:\n\n1. \"Fazzoletto\" - which generally means handkerchief but can also refer to a square scarf\n2. \"Bandana\" - if it's a smaller, casual square scarf\n\nWould you like more information about how these scarves are typically used in Italian fashion?",
