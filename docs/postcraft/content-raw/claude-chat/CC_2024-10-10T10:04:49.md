  "text": "I'd like you to be innovative in the field of knowledge storage and retrieval (for search, question answering, creative generation  etc). The problem to address is that of \"unknown unknowns\". \nYou have four tasks, please think deeply about each, using your knowledge of existing knowledge representation approaches, and be creative about imagining new ways of using them. \n \nTask 1. Create a better, generalized description of the kind of problem described here that would be clearer to a knowledge engineer : A big document corpus on natural foods has been analyzed and stored in a vector dB, search implemented using nearest neighbour. A user asks \"why is maple syrup considered the bee's knees?\", with the slang  \"bee's knees\" in the sense of \"best thing\". The corpus contained information on maple syrup and bees, but not the slang, so the search returns information about honey.\nAspects of this relate to the phrases \"searching for a needle in a haystack\" and \"for want of a nail\".\n\nTask 2. Currently at my disposal are three systems that each support knowledge representation, storage and retrieval. A vector dB as above, a graph knowledgebase using the rdf model with a sparql interface and a gpt llm. The LLM contains a massive amount of general knowledge, the vector dB and sparql store contain knowledge derived from the natural foods corpus. How might these three be used in concert to solve the problems contained in task 1.?\n\nTask 3. What knowledge representation systems might be added to the three of Task 2, to potentially increase utility? Consider existing ones and also please imagine any new ones that might help. Only consider their operation at a high conceptual level, just enough to provide some requirements specifications, we can work on implementation details later.\n\nTask 4. Synthesize all your thoughts on the preceding tasks and suggest how an integrated, unified system might be developed, including support for new knowledge representation systems.",

  "text": " Task 1: Generalized problem description\n\n\"Semantic Gap in Information Retrieval for Contextual Queries\"\n\nThis problem involves the mismatch between a user's query intent and the available information in a knowledge base due to:\n\n1. Contextual language use (e.g., slang, idioms)\n2. Implicit knowledge assumptions\n3. Lack of semantic understanding in the retrieval system\n\nThe challenge is to bridge this semantic gap to provide relevant results even when the exact query terms are not present in the corpus.\n\nQ1: How does this problem relate to word sense disambiguation?\nQ2: What role does entity linking play in addressing this issue?\nQ3: How might query expansion techniques be applied here?\nQ4: What are the limitations of purely lexical matching in this scenario?",

  "text": " Task 2: Integrating vector DB, graph KB, and LLM for improved retrieval\n\n1. Query Analysis (LLM):\n   - Use the LLM to parse and understand the query, identifying key concepts and potential slang/idioms.\n   - Perform entity linking to map \"maple syrup\" and \"bee's knees\" to canonical forms.\n\n2. Query Expansion (LLM + Graph KB):\n   - Utilize the LLM to generate synonyms and related terms for \"bee's knees\".\n   - Use the graph KB to expand \"maple syrup\" with related concepts within the food domain.\n\n3. Multi-step Retrieval:\n   a. Vector DB search:\n      - Perform initial search using expanded query terms.\n   b. Graph KB traversal:\n      - Use SPARQL to find connections between retrieved results and original query concepts.\n   c. Result Reranking:\n      - Use LLM to assess relevance of results to the original query intent.\n\n4. Response Generation:\n   - Synthesize information from top-ranked results using the LLM.\n   - Ensure the response addresses the intended meaning of \"bee's knees\".\n\nThis approach leverages the strengths of each system:\n- LLM: Natural language understanding and generation\n- Vector DB: Efficient similarity-based retrieval\n- Graph KB: Structured relationships and domain-specific knowledge\n\nQ1: How could this system handle queries with multiple levels of abstraction?\nQ2: What strategies could be employed to maintain coherence across the multi-step retrieval process?\nQ3: How might user feedback be incorporated to improve future queries?\nQ4: What are the potential performance bottlenecks in this integrated approach?",
