  "text": " I've reviewed the `package.json` and `webpack.config.js` files. The error you're encountering is due to an outdated configuration in the webpack.config.js file. The `contentBase` option is no longer supported in newer versions of webpack-dev-server. Here's what you need to do:\n\n1. Update the `devServer` configuration in `webpack.config.js`:\n\nReplace the current `devServer` object with:\n\n```javascript\ndevServer: {\n    static: {\n        directory: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),\n    },\n    open: true,\n    port: 9000,\n},\n```\n\nThis change replaces `contentBase` with the new `static` option, which is the correct way to specify the directory to serve static files from in newer versions of webpack-dev-server.\n\n2. Ensure your webpack and webpack-dev-server versions are compatible:\n\nCheck your `package.json` and make sure you have the latest compatible versions:\n\n```json\n\"devDependencies\": {\n    \"webpack\": \"^5.95.0\",\n    \"webpack-cli\": \"^5.1.4\",\n    \"webpack-dev-server\": \"^5.1.0\"\n}\n```\n\nIf these versions are different, update them using:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev webpack@5 webpack-cli@5 webpack-dev-server@5\n```\n\nAfter making these changes, try running `npm run show` again. It should resolve the error and start your development server correctly.\n\nQ1: Do I need to make any changes to the `scripts` section in `package.json`?\nQ2: Are there any other webpack configuration options that might need updating?\nQ3: How can I verify that the development server is serving the correct files?\nQ4: What are some common issues that might arise after updating webpack and its dev server?",
