We cover both experimental and computational studies, identify opportunities for performance enhancement, pathways for collector innovation, and implications of their wider deployment at the solar-generation system level. First, we classify and review the main types of PV-T collectors, including air-based, liquid-based, dual air – water, heat-pipe, building integrated and concentrated PV-T collectors. This is followed by a presentation of performance enhancement opportunities and pathways for collector innovation. Here, we address state-of-the-art design modifications, next-generation PV cell technologies, selective coatings, spectral splitting and nanofluids. Beyond this, we address wider PV-T systems and their applications, comprising a thorough review of solar combined heat and power (S – CHP), solar cooling, solar combined cooling, heat and power (S – CCHP), solar desalination, solar drying and solar for hydrogen production systems. This includes a specific review of potential performance and cost improvements and opportunities at the solar- generation system level in thermal energy storage, control and demand-side management. Subsequently, a set of the most promising PV-T systems is assessed to analyse their carbon mitigation potential and how this technology might fit within pathways for global decarbonization. It is estimated that the REmap baseline emission curve can be reduced by more than 16% in 2030 if the uptake of solar PV-T technologies can be promoted. Finally, the review turns to a critical examination of key challenges for the adoption of PV-T technology and recommendations. 1. Background and introduction 1.1. Context and motivation The interest in and demand for alternative energy from renewable sources has continued to rise globally in recent decades, promoted by an increase in environmental awareness and the growing importance placed on sustainability, reducing energy consumption and the associ - ated emissions and pollution. In 1992, the Rio Convention on Climate Change [1] established a framework for actions aimed at reducing fossil-fuel consumption and limiting the associated emissions. In 2015, over 190 countries signed a legally-binding agreement at the Paris Climate Conference [2] to keep the rise in the average global tempera - ture below 2 ◦ C (above 20th-century pre-industrial levels) [3]. To ach - ieve this challenging target, a fundamental transformation of the global energy system is required, which has in fact been taking place in recent decades [4]. Renewable energy systems have been the main drivers and will continue to be essential for this transformation as they contribute to all objectives: promoting the security of supply while lowering energy costs, reducing emissions while driving growth and generating jobs through industrial development. A record 200 GW of renewable energy capacity was added in 2019. Renewable energy accounted for 27% of global electricity use and over 18% of the world ’ s total energy con - sumption according to the latest REN21 report [5].

This growth has been made possible by the implementation of national policies that have supported renewable projects in Europe, and by the Chinese policy of subsidies for PV systems [5,7]. In 2019, the renewable energy sector employed 11.5 million people, among these 4.6 million were employed in the solar sector [8]. Solar energy is an abundant primary-energy resource, which can be exploited in cost-competitive and reliable ways for electrical power generation, either with PV technology or thermodynamic cycles in concentrated solar power (CSP) systems, as well as for heating or cooling purposes through ST systems. Some of the advantages of this renewable resource compared to others, e.g., wind, are its larger predictability on an annual basis and daily [9], the low degradation rate of the compo - nents of a solar installation during its lifetime which is generally 20 – 25 years [10,11], and that this technology rarely underperforms or fails. For example, long-term field data show that PV panels experience, on average, a power output loss of only 0.5% per year [12], and only 2% of the PV panels installed do not meet the manufacturer ’ s warranty after 10 years [13]. The total worldwide power generation capacity of installed PV panels increased by 12% in 2019 and reached a record of 630 GW in total, while the thermal energy generation capacity of installed ST col - lectors amounted to 480 GW (thermal Watt) in 2019, with China ac - counting for almost 70% of the total solar thermal capacity [6,14], which corresponds to savings of about 140 million tons of CO 2 per year [6].

Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 3 countries in Europe have an installed capacity that covers above 8% of the total demand (Italy 9%, Greece 8% and Germany 8%) [5], as a result of the strong incentives for solar electricity adopted in the recent years. As a consequence of this growth, the cost of PV panels has been falling, reaching an average selling price of PV panels of 0.38 USD/W p (rated Watt peak) in 2019 [15,16], and it is becoming apparent that solar PV technologies will soon become one of the lowest-cost options for elec - tricity generation. This technology has the potential not only of providing on-grid power, displacing fossil fuel consumption, but also PV panels can provide electrification in remote rural areas, particularly in developing countries, where there is no or limited access to the elec - tricity grid. By the end of 2019, around 9.5 thousand mini-grids systems entirely or partly based on renewables were in operation together with small-scaled distributed standalone systems [17]. For instance, in China small-scale standalone PV systems substantially contributed to the progressive electrification of areas not yet interconnected to the main electricity grid [7]. The solar heat market represents a notable share of the global heating market, mainly in providing space heating (SH) and domestic hot water (DHW) [11]. Small-scale thermosiphon systems, which account for 60% of current ST systems, are facing market pressure from heat pumps (HPs) and PV systems. The global capacity of ST decreased by 6% in 2019 compared to 2018, driven by a market slowdown in China (new collector installations in China decreased by 8%) [6]. However, the number of large-scale (megawatt-scale) ST systems for industrial applications and district heating still keeps consistently growing in recent years. For example, the market of Denmark increased by 170% in 2019 owing to several newly installed large-scale solar thermal systems [6]. Compared to the PV market, the installation of ST systems in the EU has not expe - rienced the same growth. For example, approximately 50 GW of PV panels and 15 GW of ST collectors were installed in Germany by 2019 [18]. This trend is attributed to the lack of incentives, financial support, education and knowledge [11]. The experience gained from ST in - stallations in countries such as Cyprus, Greece and Austria, indicates the great potential of such systems for utilizing solar energy, and that this potential is still far from having been exploited. Therefore, there is potential for the development and wider use of solar systems as they can help in the transformation of the worldwide energy system [19]. However, further investment in existing as well as in future solar technologies is necessary to reduce the costs and make these systems cost-competitive, as well as to ensure appropriate infra - structure [20,21], along with increased public awareness and support. If solar generation should be deployed in a distributed nature, particularly in urban environments, then the amount of suitable space for solar installations will become increasingly scarce [22]. Therefore, to be competitive, the cost per unit of energy from solar technologies should be low and the energy generated per m 2 should be maximized. PV systems are widely used and there is a broad commercial offer available in the market. However, the limited conversion efficiency, the high PV cell temperature that can be reached, which damage the PV cells, and dust accumulation, are some of the barriers that hinder their potential. In an attempt to regulate the PV cell temperature, there has been important research in the last decades in the assessment of different cooling techniques [23]. This research gave rise to hybrid PV-thermal (PV-T) collectors, which generate both electricity and useful thermal energy from the same aperture area, and with overall (electrical + thermal) efficiencies that are much higher (reaching > 70%) than separate standalone systems. PV-T collectors can easily be integrated with other system compo - nents (energy conversion, energy storage, etc.) to provide both thermal and electrical energy outputs. For example, PV-T collectors can be easily integrated with economical hot water tanks for thermal storage, and with batteries for electricity storage. Thus, this technology appears as a particularly promising alternative, especially within a high-penetration scenario, and particularly in applications such as in the urban environ - ment, where there are both thermal and electrical energy demands and the efficient use of limited space is essential. PV-T collectors can also be integrated with other types of solar collectors (i.e., PV panels or ST collectors) to adjust the ratio of heating and electricity supply, to meet specific demands [24]. The relevance and potential of PV-T collectors and their integration with other components to obtain new solutions in HVAC systems were underpinned by Task 60 “ Application of PV-T Col - lectors and New Solutions in HVAC Systems ” , which run from 2018 to 2020, in the solar heating and cooling (SHC) Programme of the Inter - national Energy Agency (IEA) [25]. 1.2. Physical considerations of PV-T collectors The initial motivation for the development of PV-T technology was the possibility of using a heat transfer fluid to cool the PV cells in such collectors. However, the delivery of a thermal output at a useful (high enough) temperature [26] leads inevitably to a conflict in the design and operation of conventional PV-T collectors, as these can be operated at temperatures higher than those of PV panels in the same conditions. When the priority is electricity generation, the heat transfer circuit is kept at a low temperature to avoid an otherwise undesirable decrease in the electrical efficiency of the PV cells. This constraint limits the use of the thermal energy generated. Therefore, a trade-off is needed depending on the specific application and the environmental conditions [27]. This introduces challenges for the design and operation of PV-T collectors, and solutions to overcome this conflict have been proposed, e.g., through spectral splitting, amongst others, presented in Section 3. The two main types of solar PV cell technologies considered for use in PV-T collectors are either based on crystalline silicon wafers or thin-film semiconductor materials deposited onto a glass or metal foil [28]. For a PV-T collector, the first significant difference is the fact that a c-Si PV panel is composed of a mosaic of discrete cells made from wafers whereas a thin-film module is made by patterning a large area of the semiconductor film. Superficially thin-film photovoltaics appears to lend themselves to PV-T collectors since, in principle, the PV cell could be deposited directly upon a thermally conductive heat exchanger. However, since silicon solar cells are manufactured as standard units that can be used interchangeably in regular PV panels and PV-T col - lectors, it is presently easier and cheaper to laminate c-Si cells to a heat sink rather than develop a bespoke process for depositing and patterning thin-film materials. This point becomes apparent when we consider the fabrication steps involved with each technology. In the case of c-Si, the process starts with processes developed for microelectronics to fabricate silicon wafers which are then processed into solar cells and then assembled into modules, usually by connecting the cells in series-connected strings, illustrated in Fig. 1(a). For a thin-film module, the process starts with the deposition of material onto a substrate (glass, metal foil, or polymer) which is then patterned using a laser to produce small strips of the active area, shown in Fig. 1(b). The patterning is necessary since the current density arising from a typical PV material is of the order 300 A m 2 . The issue does not arise in silicon modules since the series-connected silicon cells naturally divide this large current density by a factor of ~30. The spectral breath of sunlight places firm boundaries around the efficiency of PV power conversion but many of the losses in a standard PV cell can be recovered as thermal energy in a PV-T system. To indicate how much thermal and electrical energy is available we develop a simple model to quantify the losses. Sunlight spans photon energies ranging from 0.4 to 4 eV and is plotted as a spectral flux b( E ) in Fig. 2(a). An ideal semiconductor absorber with a band-gap E g will selectively absorb sunlight with photon energies above that band-gap energy thereby promoting an electron from the valance band to the conduction band (Process 1 in Fig. 2 (b)) M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 4 while light below the band-gap energy will pass unabsorbed through the solar (Process 2 in Fig. 2(b)). For simplicity, in the example shown in Fig. 2(b) the excess photon energy ( E g ) is imparted to the excited elec - tron 1 that rapidly dissipates this energy through a thermalization pro - cess (Process 3 in Fig. 2(b)) to establish a thermal population of excited electrons. The occupation of electrons in the conduction band can be described by a quasi-Fermi level denoted by μ c and a similar quasi-Fermi level denoted by μ v for the holes. The separation of these quasi-Fermi levels results in the voltage ( V ) at the solar cell terminals which in turn drives current ( I ) through a load in the external circuit. Two limiting cases for the solar cell configuration are shown in Fig. 2 (c), in both cases the PV active photons are illustrated by the blue arrow while the pink arrow indicates sub-band-gap photons that are not absorbed by the semiconductor material. Most non-silicon solar cells correspond to Fig. 2(c – i) where the unabsorbed low-energy photons are reflected from the rear surface and leave the solar cell. Fig. 2(c-ii) shows a configuration where low-energy photons are absorbed by a separate thermal absorber. Uniquely silicon solar cells correspond to Fig. 2(c-ii) where the absorptivity of the solar cell is close to unity from UV through to the mid-IR hence completely extinguishing the solar [29,30]. Only the radiative recombination loss (Process 4 in Fig. 2(b)) is irrecoverable in a PV-T system. However, even in the radiative limit, it is a comparatively small fraction of the overall solar cell power-loss when operating at the maximum power-point [31]. Furthermore, in almost all solar cell semiconductor materials, parasitic non-radiative processes that operate in parallel to the radiative loss tend to be orders of magnitude larger, hence for a practical PV-T system recombination losses can be assumed to generate heat, rather than light. In the solar cell configuration shown in Fig. 2(c – i) the energy associated with the belo - w- E g loss (Process 2 in Fig. 2(b)) is lost from the solar cell however in the solar cell configuration shown in Fig. 2(c-ii), it results in the full ab - sorption of the solar flux. To illustrate the behaviour of two different solar cell types, we consider the limiting cases of silicon ( E g = 1.12 eV) and CdTe ( E g = 1.5eV) that correspond to the top-two solar cell terrestrial solar cell technologies manufactured by the capacity to date [32]. A simple model for the current ( I ) voltage ( V ) characteristic of a PV cell is: I ( V ) = J sc  E g )  J 01 ( e qV kT  1 ) (1.1) Fig. 1.

M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 5 where J sc is the cell short-circuit current density, J 01 is the diode satu - ration current density, q is the electronic charge and k is Boltzmann ’ s constant. Assuming full absorption to the band-gap energy E g and in the absence of reflectivity losses, the upper limit to the solar cell short- circuit current is given by: J sc  E g ) = q ∫ ∞ E g b ( E ) d E (1.2) The thermal generation in a PV cell can be approximated by: Q ( V ) = ∫ ∞ E th E b ( E ) d E  V I ( V ) (1.3) where E th is the threshold for the onset of absorption in the PV-T collector. Taking illustrative examples of a CdTe solar cell ( E th = E g = 1.5 eV, J 01 = 5.54 × 10  13 A m  2 ) and silicon solar cell ( E th = 0 eV, E g = 1.1 eV, J 01 = 7.64 × 10  10 A m  2 ), the current – voltage characteristics, elec - trical power and thermal generation are plotted in Fig. 3. The electricity generation potential of the PV cells is typically the primary energy output of PV-T collectors. In the two examples here, the IV characteristics of silicon and CdTe cells are broadly determined by their band-gap energy. The lower band-gap of silicon provides a larger current but smaller voltage compared to CdTe. The optimum band-gap energy for electrical power conversion is approximately 1.3 eV, which is between the band-gaps of CdTe and silicon [31]. The electrical power delivered by the two cells is broadly similar but the maximum power point for the CdTe cell sits at a higher voltage than the silicon. All PV cell parameters are dependent upon temperature, hence the power that is delivered by a PV device is: P ( T ) = V oc ( T ) J sc ( T ) FF ( T ) (1.4) The temperature coefficient of power ( β Pmax ) is composed of the sum of three different coefficients: β Pmax = β Voc + β Jsc + β FF (1.5) Of these temperature coefficients, the voltage coefficient ( β Voc ) dominates the power loss with increasing temperature, owing to an in - crease in internal recombination rate with temperature. The tempera - ture coefficient is weakly positive since the thermal expansion of the semiconductor lattice leads to a reduction in the electronic band-gap and hence marginally higher absorbed photon flux. The fill factor ( FF ) also has a weak dependence on temperature. The temperature dependency of the fill factor depends largely on the cell voltage and any temperature dependency of series resistance R s : 1 FF d FF d T = ( 1  1 . 02 FF 0 ) ( 1 V oc d V oc d T  1 T )  R s V oc / I sc  R s ( 1 R s d R s d T ) (1.6) In turn, the temperature dependency of voltage depends on the band- gap energy, the V oc and an empirical parameter γ that accounts for the recombination mechanisms present in the solar cell [33]: d V oc d T =  E g q  V oc + γ kT q T (1.7) Overall, this gives a strong temperature coefficient dependency with band-gap energy ( E g ). Cells with low band-gaps, such as Ge have large, negative temperature coefficients power, with silicon and other con - ventional PV materials having correspondingly smaller temperature coefficients. Therefore, from the perspective of achieving the smallest temperature coefficient, it is desirable to use a high-band-gap semi - conductor. Since a high band-gap will leave many photons unabsorbed, these could be used in a thermal collector. It is also worth noting that in Eq. (1.6), the V oc itself also affects the temperature coefficient. From a wider PV-T perspective, however, the thermal generation potential of these collectors when using different solar cell technologies will also be of interest and this can be substantially different (refer back to Fig. 3(c) for the two cell types considered above). Under short-circuit and open-circuit, no electrical power is delivered, but since the silicon solar cell absorbs the full solar spectrum, the thermal generation equates to the incident solar energy. The CdTe device only absorbs light above the band-gap energy, giving substantially lower thermal generation. At the maximum power point, the thermal generation reaches a minimum, yet the silicon cell still delivers 750 W/m 2 at maximum power, while the CdTe cell only reaches 400 W/m 2 . We will return to the current elec - trical and thermal performance of different PV-T collectors in Section 2 and the potential for improvement in Section 3. 1.3. Previous reviews Almost all previous review papers on PV-T technology focussed on this technology at the collector level, reviewing various design and geometrical configurations based on different thermal management concepts. Older reviews focussed on air- or liquid-based PV-T collectors [34 – 36], while more recent ones also include concentrated PV-T (CPV-T) collectors [37], heat-pipe PV-T collectors [23,38 – 40], phase-change material (PCM)-based PV-T collectors [23,28,38 – 41], dual air – water PV-T and PV-T collectors with nanofluids [38,39,42,43]. Some of them review alternative structural designs [23,35,42,44], while others analyse the PV-T layers [44], and parameters that affect the performance of flat-plate PV-T collectors [45]. Other reviews analysed previous studies that discussed the design and cooling considerations aimed at improved collector performance [46], or reviewed studies that included environmental issues about PV-T systems [40] and analysed factors that affect PV-T collectors from an environmental point of view [47]. Others also include a review of the progress on practical PV-T applications [28,37,41], analysing the limitations and advantages of PV-T collectors [28]. Meanwhile, other reviews specifically focussed on liquid-based PV-T collectors [48], reviewing previous experimental and simulation studies of refrigerant-based and water-based PV-T collectors. There are several reviews of solar cooling systems, mostly focussed Fig. 3. Characteristic performance of solar cells made from silicon solar cell (solid line) and CdTe solar cell (dashed line) showing: (a) the IV characteristics; (b) electrical power; and (c) thermal generation. M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 6 on the integration of ST collectors, including flat-plate collectors (FPCs), evacuated-tube collectors (ETCs) and parabolic-trough collectors (PTCs), with thermally-driven cooling technologies, including ab/ adsorption [49 – 59], desiccant [53 – 56,59], ejector/Rankine [54,55,59, 60] or Stirling [59] systems. Some reviews also address PV panels in - tegrated with HPs [49,51,53,55,59], Stirling or thermoelectric [59] systems, while a previous review of solar systems integrated with ab - sorption HPs [57] includes a section on PV-T systems, but as a separate system from the HP (see Table 1). Two recent reviews on solar heating and cooling (SHC) technologies report several alternatives for solar heating or cooling, without addressing combined heating and cooling technologies. One review focusses on solar thermal based on FPC/ETC or solar air collectors, or alternatively PV panels; air-based PV-T and water-based PV-T systems are briefly discussed as solar heating systems [61]. The second review covers solar thermal and electrical systems, electrical and thermal storage options, heat pumps and solar cooling alternatives, without specifically addressing PV-T collectors, but mentioning previous PV-T studies [62]. We have found very few review papers that specifically address PV-T collectors and wider systems for heating and/or cooling applications [63 – 65] (see Table 1). Amongst these, Guo et al. [63] focusses on PV-T façade and solar thermal (air/water) desiccant systems for cooling and dehumidification, while Alobaid et al. [64] review current de - velopments of PV-T collectors integrated with absorption cooling sys - tems. A recent paper [69] briefly reviews SHC systems by absorption and adsorption systems driven by solar thermal (FPC/ETC/PFC) or PV-T/CPV-T collectors, focussing on the modelling and simulation of polygeneration systems based con PV-T/CPV-T collectors for the pro - vision of cooling, heating and power to buildings. Other studies review the integration of ST and PV-T collectors with solar assisted heat pumps (SAHP) for heating purposes [65 – 68], (a) analysing and comparing previous studies of PV, ST or PV-T collectors integrated air-source HPs [66], (b) reviewing mathematical models for SAHP systems and per - formance enhancements [67], or (c) specifically focussing on reviewing the performance, component details and of research progress of PV-T-SAHP systems [68,70]. However, none of the above [65 – 68] is specifically focussed on PV-T collectors, and none of them addresses other applications such as solar cooling, desalination, drying or hydrogen production. 1.4. Aim and contribution This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of- the-art in PV-T collectors and of the wider solar-energy systems within which they can be implemented, and also to assess the local (at the end- user/building level) and worldwide energy and carbon mitigation po - tential of such systems. In this review, we cover experimental and computational studies, identify performance enhancement opportunities and innovation path - ways and, also, the implications of widespread deployment at the solar- generation system level. Specifically, we first proceed to classify and review the main types of PV-T collectors, including air-based, liquid- based, dual air – water, heat-pipe, building-integrated and CPV-T col - lectors (Section 2). This is followed by a presentation of techno- economic performance enhancement opportunities and pathways for collector innovation (Section 3). Here, we address state-of-the-art design modifications, next-generation PV cell technologies, selective coatings, spectral splitting and nanofluids. Beyond this, we include content with a particular focus on wider PV-T-based systems and their applications (Section 4), comprising a thorough review of solar combined heat and power (S – CHP), solar cooling, solar combined cooling, heat and power (S – CCHP), solar desalination, solar drying systems, and solar for hydrogen production. This includes a specific review of potential per - formance and cost improvements and opportunities at the solar- generation system level in thermal energy storage, component integra - tion, control and demand-side management (DSM) (Section 5). Throughout the paper, we review research lines extending, importantly, to research gaps and opportunities to promote the technology readiness levels (TRLs) of important related elements of wider PV-T-based systems. Subsequently, a set of the most promising PV-T systems is assessed in a series of decarbonization scenarios to analyse the carbon mitigation potential of PV-T systems and how this technology could fit in various pathways for global decarbonization (Section 6). Finally, the review will turn to a critical examination of the future of PV-T tech - nology and systems, including challenges, recommendations and main conclusions (Section 7). 2. Solar PV-T collectors Most of the solar radiation absorbed by a PV cell is converted to heat (in fact, internal energy), increasing the temperature of the cell and decreasing its electrical efficiency [35,71 – 73]. To overcome this, solar cells can be cooled by a suitable fluid (gas or liquid) flow, decreasing their temperature and improving their efficiency, while producing a useful thermal output. The synergistic combination of the improved electrical output and the associated heat provision potential has moti - vated the development of hybrid PV-T collectors [35,71 – 73], which have emerged as holistic solar energy solutions that combine PV cells for electricity generation, coupled with a thermal absorber containing a heat transfer fluid for heat provision from the same collector [71, 74 – 77]. PV-T collectors enable the generation and use of electricity onsite, so-called self-consumption, which is acknowledged as the cheapest way to generate energy with renewables while reducing the stress on the local grid [4,78]. PV-T collectors can be integrated with other technol - ogies such as HPs or cooling systems [64,79], can be used for solar desalination [80,81], solar drying [82,83], or hydrogen production [84, 85], and the excess electricity generated can be stored to be used later on [86 – 90]. Moreover, careful planning of the energy use via DSM is of key importance in the effective operation of the system [86,87], as detailed in Section 5.3. There are several classifications of hybrid PV-T collectors depending on different factors: (a) the collector cover(s); (b) the type of PV Table 1 Summary of previous reviews. Ref.

There are different methods to cool the PV panel, and the optimum solution strongly depends on several factors such as the PV technology used, the concentration ratio (if any) and the weather conditions where the system is installed [23]. The two main cooling mechanisms are passive and active cooling. The former refers to technologies that minimize or extract the heat absorbed by the PV panel without addi - tional power consumption. There are different options such as the integration on the rear PV panel surface of fins or other extruded sur - faces made of high thermal conductivity metals such as aluminium or copper, to enhance heat transfer to the ambient; the use of PCMs or the use of heat pipes that efficiently transfer the heat through a boiling-condensing process. The main constraint of these alternatives is that the heat dissipation is limited by the contact area between the heat sink and the ambient [23,41]. Alternatively, active cooling systems extract the heat using different cooling fluids driven by fans in case of air or a pump when liquids are used. The cooling medium can be in the liquid or gaseous phase. The most common liquid used in flat-plate PV-T collectors is water or a mixture of water and glycol to avoid freezing. Meanwhile, air-based PV- T collectors provide a simpler solution to cool solar PV cells. For each of these types of PV-T systems, there are several designs of the thermal absorber, as shown in the following sections. The potential of PV-T systems has been confirmed with simulations in reliable computational environments such as ANSYS Fluent, COM - SOL, MATLAB, Modelica, Polysun, TRANSOL, and TRNSYS. However, despite their demonstrated potential, only a modest number of manu - facturers are producing PV-T collectors and the market remains small [91,92]. A market survey was undertaken under Task 60 of the Inter - national Energy Agengy (IEA), with 26 collector manufacturers and suppliers from 11 countries identified. The survey showed that most of the manufacturers focus on liquid-based PV-T collectors (48% uncov - ered PV-T collectors, 28% covered PV-T collectors, 4% vacuum tube PV-T collectors), while 12% manufacture air-based PV-T collectors and 8% CPV-T collectors [92]. Fig. 4 shows the performance of commercially available PV-T col - lectors, in terms of both thermal and electrical outputs. Note that the CPV-T options shown are low-concentrating ratios, without tracking. It should be highlighted that a specific norm for testing PV-T collectors is not available currently, so the thermal and electrical outputs are often stated at different conditions, and thus comparisons among different products are not straightforward. The thermal performance of PV-T collectors can be tested according to the standard ISO 9806:2017, but this has several limitations, as it is intended for ST collectors, so the electrical output is not considered. For the PV panel output, there is a standard procedure, following the methodology of the IEC 60904, and usually, this output is provided by the PV panel manufacturer. However, if PV cell performance is not characterized before its integration into a PV-T collector, it should be characterized accordingly when character - izing the PV-T collector, separately from the thermal performance characterization [93]. Fig. 5 shows a map of the same commercially available PV-T col - lectors in terms of the market price (as of 2020 when this data was collected) vs . their estimated thermal and electrical outputs. It is observed that, in general, water-based PV-T collectors have larger out - puts (W/m 2 ) at a lower price ( € /m 2 ). By the end of 2019, a total PV-T collector area of 1,160,000 m 2 was installed, with a total thermal capacity of around 530 MW and a peak PV power of around 180 MW. In the European market, France is the market leader with an installed collector area of approximately 484,000 m 2 , followed by Germany with around 112,000 m 2 . Outside of Europe, Korea is the market leader with an installed area of ~280,000 m 2 , fol - lowed by China with ~133,000 m 2 [6]. From the total installed thermal capacity, 57% corresponds to uncovered water-based PV-T collectors, 41% to air-based PV-T collectors and the remaining 2% to covered water-based PV-T collectors, while vacuum tube PV-T collectors and CPV-T collectors play only a minor role [92].

M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 8 2.1. Air-based PV-T collectors In air-based PV-T collectors, air is selected as the working (or, heat transfer) fluid, and acts to regulate the temperature of the PV cells. The main applications of this type of collector are for ventilation and space heating, or air-preheating purposes, integrated into roofs and building façades [23,73], or installed as independent components on roofs [34], where the generated hot air can be used for drying, space heating or ventilation. There are two main types of air-based PV-T collectors, namely flat- plate and CPV-T collectors. Flat-plate collectors are considered the most common and simple design [94]. Air-based PV-T collectors typi - cally have a lower capital cost than liquid-based equivalents and are suitable for building applications in medium- and high-latitude regions. In low-latitude regions, the ambient air temperature during the day is high for almost half of the year, therefore limiting the application of air-based PV-T systems to a shorter period in terms of effective elec - tricity production. There are different configurations according to several factors. First, these systems can be classified depending on how the air flows through the system. Natural circulation is simpler and has lower costs than forced circulation, while the latter is more efficient. However, the en - ergy necessary to drive fans decreases the net electricity gain of the system in forced circulation systems [71]. While liquid-based PV-T collectors need a restricted passage to allow the liquid flow near the PV cells ’ back surface (usually a pipe or conduit), the air is allowed to flow both at the back and over the front surfaces of PV cells in air-based PV-T collectors. This can be done with mechanical power, i.e., a fan, or the flow can be naturally driven by buoyancy forces. When air is flowing over the front surface of cells, an extra glazing layer is required to form a passage between the cells and the environment. Although this is bene - ficial from a thermal performance perspective, it is less effective con - cerning electrical performance, as it increases the operating PV cell temperature for the same conditions, and imposes an additional reflec - tion loss to the incoming solar radiation. According to Chow [35], we can discriminate between four main collector types, depending on the air channel configuration, with PV-T collectors having: a channel above the PV cells, a channel below the PV cells, the PV cells between single-pass channels, and double-glass designs (see Fig. 6). The most noticeable difference is the duct that brings the cold (ambient or recirculated) air towards the collector, usually at the bottom of the collector, and the duct that removes the hot air usually from the top of the collector. Sometimes recirculation is used, i.e., the air flows first over the PV cell ’ s top surfaces and then directed underneath them before exiting the collector (Design (d) in Fig. 6). In this case, the inlet and outlet ducts are at the same end of the collector, usually the bottom one, reducing the height of the collector but also causing shading between subsequent rows. Different conclusions have been drawn, for example, some studies conclude that double-pass designs (Design (d) in Fig. 6) outperform single- pass designs, while others conclude that Design (c) is the least consuming in terms of fan power [35]. Other investigators considered double-glass PV-T collectors [41], or the addition of a suspended metal sheet in the middle of the air channel to improve thermal performance [23]. In the comprehensive review of air-based PV-T systems with and without thermal storage by Tyagi et al. [95], it was concluded that air-based PV-T systems are particularly well-suited to crop drying and electricity production. Additionally, the application of PCMs for thermal storage in PV-T systems was mentioned. Another review presented a broad classification of PV-T systems, an extensive list of important aspects of these systems together with sug - gestions for future work needed on the subject [96]. It was stated that air-based PV-T systems are most suitable for space heating applications in cold regions, since the ambient air temperature during the day is low most of the year, therefore eliminating the loss of effective electricity production while taking advantage of the collected heat from the PV-T collector for space heating. The status and future perspectives of PV-T systems, in particular air- based PV-T systems, have also been reviewed [39,43]. According to Al-Waeli et al. [39], air-based PV-T collectors have general overall ef - ficiencies (electrical plus thermal) ranging from 30% to 60%. Of this total efficiency, the electrical component associated with crystalline silicon PV cells is typically in the range of 15 – 20% at typical operating temperatures. A review with attention to different solar cell technologies and recent techniques to improve such systems concluded that PV cells integrated with ST systems are self-sustained and more economical in rural areas [97]. A review focussing on the design of PV-T systems [46] highlighted the importance of nanofluids and nano-PCMs as alternatives or complementary to traditional cooling and storage solutions. From this analysis, it was concluded that cooling both sides of PV cells, with the employment of op - tical filtration using nanofluids, can result in significant improvements to the performance of a PV-T system. In addition, optimization of the cross-section of cooling channels and the use of honeycombs and nano-PCMs for storage and cooling purposes can provide better distribution of the thermal load. Guidelines for the appropriate selection of the channel depth, air flow rate and air distribution duct diameter optimization in PV-T collectors have also been studied [98]. An extensive study of the air cooling design and performance in a commercial air-based PV-T collector by natural flow is reported in Ref. [99], which suggests optimal configurations for PV-T solar systems. Other authors [100] investigated air-based PV-T collectors through modelling at steady-state conditions, to determine their thermal char - acteristics. ¨ Ozakin and Kaya [101] studied an air-cooled channel in an air-based PV-T collector to consider the effects of fins added to the channel and to estimate the exergetic performance of the collector. A similar study [102] presented a combined theoretical and experimental investigation of such collectors. A glazed collector was also tested experimentally by Agrawal and Tiwari [103,104], who estimated a payback period for the system of 1.8 years and 16.5 tons of CO 2 emission avoidance. The performance of four different air-based PV-T collector configu - rations with single-pass, double-pass and with glazing was studied by Slimani et al. [105], who concluded that the double-pass collector per - forms better in terms of overall daily energy generation. According to Hussain et al. [106], further work on efficiency improvements, cost Fig. 6. Longitudinal cross-section of common air-based PV-T collector designs.

Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 9 reductions and building integration of air-based PV-T collectors are necessary for good performance to be attained. Several researchers have paid attention to various air-channel con - figurations. A theoretical analysis of air-based PV-T collectors [107] concluded that a glass cover improves the thermal efficiency of the sys - tem but reduces the electrical efficiency, in line with other similar work in the literature. It was additionally concluded that the solar radiation in - tensity, flow rate and channel depth are important parameters that in - fluence the system performance. Another study focussing on the channel configuration with additional fins and metal sheets in the flow channel [99] concluded that the addition of fins and metal sheets in the channel can improve the system performance. Metal sheets in the channel were also investigated by Shahsavar and Ameri [108] (see Table 2). A transpired collector with a transparent channel for air circulation was tested by Gholampour and Ameri [109]. Experimental validation of a model was performed with CFD modelling in Fluent, obtaining thermal system efficiencies of 45 – 55%. Other studies have used modelling to investigate the performance of air PV-T systems [100,113,117], or a combination of theoretical analyses, modelling and experimental in - vestigations [113,114]. A summary of the different air-based PV-T collectors is provided in Table 2, addressing previous research on PV-T collectors with and without glazing, different arrangements of air channels, forced circula - tion by fans, adding fins in the air channel and size of the air channel. It can be concluded that double-pass PV-T collectors outperform single- pass designs, that glazed PV-T collectors have higher overall effi - ciencies than unglazed collectors, and that the use of metal sheets and fins in the air channel increases the thermal efficiency. The most common air-based PV-T configurations have a high TRL of 9 (actual system proven in operational environment), with several manufacturers on the market, such as GSE and Sunovate, as detailed in the market survey undertaken under Task 60 of the IEA [25,92]. Ac - cording to this survey, the French market is dominant, where almost all of the manufactured PV-T collectors are air-based PV-T collectors [92]. 2.2.

Moreover, the use of these diffuse reflectors can offset the negative effect of the optical losses in the case of glazed PV-T collectors, achieving higher electrical and thermal efficiency. Thermal efficiencies of up to 80% and 75% for water and air extraction modes respectively have been reported [71,73]. In CSP systems, optical reflectors focus the solar radiation on chan - nels that contain a heat transfer fluid. PV cells can be placed on the top of these channels, therefore providing electricity, while the fluid cools the PV cells, avoiding their decrease in efficiency due to an increase in temperature. In this line, some authors [297 – 299] have developed a low-concentration, linear, hybrid micro-concentrator collector for rooftop installation. Its main advantage is the replacement of expensive solar cells with inexpensive optics and tracking systems, consisting of Fig. 15. Building-integrated dual air – water PV-T collector [292]. M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 18 low-cost, ultra-light-weight Fresnel mirror arrays, which allow increasing the concentrating ratio to up to 20 – 30 × , which is enough for the domestic market needs [297,298]. However, although the demands on optics, tracking systems, thermal management, and maintenance are considerably lower than for high-concentration CPV-T collectors, these collectors still have some drawbacks to enter the rooftop urban market, such as the need for lower maintenance, more reliability, easier opera - tion and a more economical installation [297]. In higher concentration systems, more complex optics, tracking, and working fluids outside of water are necessary. Additionally, many of these systems use either spectral beam splitting (SBS), as recently reviewed [300], or spectral absorption filtering, also recently reviewed [301], to reduce the flux on the solar cells to limit the working tem - perature of the PV system. One approach of SBS is to use secondary mirrors to redirect light to a CPV-T system, as was proposed by Liu et al. [302], where a linear Fresnel mirror was coupled to a beam splitter to separate the spectrum. In their work, the visible light is transmitted through the beam splitter over wavelengths from 590 to 1082 nm to the receiver while the remainder was reflected to the thermal portion. Only modelling was conducted. Kandili [303] demonstrated a CPV-T system using parabolic dish concentrators where the light was focussed onto PV cells coated with an SBS mirror which reflects light to a vacuum tube. The system demonstrated a combined system efficiency of 7.3% (with 1.6 m 2 surface area under 720 W/m 2 of solar radiation). A modelling study by Yu et al. [304] focussed on a retrofit for parabolic trough mirrors that replaces the traditional mirrors with PV cells and dichroic mirrors. Silicon hetero-junction cells were attached to a glass trough with dichroic mirrors covering the cells to reflect the wavelengths (shorter than 500 nm and longer than 1100 nm) to the heat collection element (HCE). The model demonstrated an energy output increase of 36% above that of a pure CSP system. Economic models predicted a 30% increase in the cost of the collector [304]. A large-scale experimental investigation of spectral beam splitting [305] developed a parabolic trough coupled to an organic Rankine cycle. Using vertical multi-junction solar cells and dichroic mirrors that intercepted 29% of the light from the trough, PV cell efficiencies of 29 – 30% were reported. Considering the full trough aperture area, the efficiency of the cells added in the retrofit was 3%. In an SBS demonstration using GaAs PV cells [306] that comprised a secondary mirror due to the high below-gap reflectivity, it was possible to create a secondary reflector comprised of the PV elements for increasing flux on the HCE. Another retrofit approach using the existing architecture of parabolic troughs coupled to a spectral splitter was demonstrated using SBS mirrors that reflected light onto a triangular receiver while transmitting the remainder of the light to the existing HCE [307]. The concept of spectral absorption was developed using a thin absorbing film filter as demonstrated by Stanley et al. [308]. PV cell efficiency was 3.6 – 4.0%, while the observed thermal efficiency was ~35% at working fluid temperatures of 120 ◦ C, approaching the maximum working temperature due to the onset of flow boiling. This approach is unique in that it utilizes a solid film deployed in the liquid, but the vast majority of spectral absorption techniques employ volu - metric absorption by deploying nanoparticles directly into the fluid. One of the first experimental demonstrations was by F. Crisostomo et al. [309] where various concentrations of silver nanodiscs in water were both the spectral filter and working fluid. A peak overall efficiency of 33% was obtained. An et al. [310] demonstrated a CPV-T system based on polypyrrole and water. The authors reported an overall efficiency (based upon temperature rise, not flowing fluid) at a peak of 25%, with a peak PV cell efficiency of 11%. This study was followed up with Cu 9 S 5 nanoparticle suspended in oleylamine fluid with back contact c-Si solar cells [310]. The authors reported a peak total efficiency of 34% with the PV cell efficiency at 12% and the thermal efficiency at 23% with the temperature of the fluid exceeding 100 ◦ C [311]. Otanicar et al. [312] was the first demonstration of a nanoparticle absorbing fluid in a CPV-T system where the working fluid was flowing and exceeded 100 ◦ C [312]. The prototype system used a combination of gold and indium tin oxide nanoparticles suspended in Duratherm S to achieve thermal and elec - trical efficiencies of 61% and 4% respectively at a fluid working tem - perature of 110 ◦ C. 3. Performance enhancement and pathways for collector innovation According to previous reviews [28,35,129], the main bottlenecks for the widespread commercialization of PV-T collectors are the higher price compared to side-by-side solar systems (PV and ST collectors), public awareness, product standardization, warranties and performance certification, installation and training experiences. These studies concluded that more research is required on new and cost-competitive products, recognized testing procedures and standards, and demon - stration projects. Special interest is given to the need of improving the electrical and thermal performance of liquid-based PV-T collectors [129], in particular to the research in the thermal absorber design and fabrication [41], material and coating selection, energy conversion and effectiveness, performance testing, system optimization and control and reliability [28]. The total energy output (electrical plus heat) of a hybrid PV-T col - lector depends on several factors, such as the configuration design and heat extraction arrangement employed; the solar irradiance, ambient temperature, and wind speed; and the operating temperatures of several important components. In most applications, the electrical output is the main priority, in which case the operating condition of the heat transfer arrangement is adjusted to optimize electrical performance. Specifically, Fig. 16. Schematics of the most common types of CPV-T collectors. M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 19 the cooling fluid in the heat transfer circuit is kept at a low temperature to avoid an otherwise undesirable decrease in the electrical efficiency of the PV cell [71,73 – 75]. Therefore, most PV-T systems deployed to date are aimed at delivering low-temperature heat ( < 40 ◦ C) [22]. However, this constraint for the heat transfer fluid to exit the collector at low temperatures to allow higher electrical outputs imposes a limit on its posterior use for heating purposes. It is believed that the PV-T technology can reach a considerably larger market if it was optimized to deliver thermal energy at 40 – 60 ◦ C, as these are the delivery temperatures of DHW and space heating [22]. Nevertheless, if the system is designed to provide higher fluid temper - atures at the PV-T collector outlet, then the electrical efficiency de - creases [71,73,75,313]. Hence, a design conflict arises between the electrical and thermal performance of hybrid PV-T collectors, and a trade-off is needed depending on the end-user needs and the local solar and environmental conditions. This conflict, along with the higher costs of PV-T collectors compared to side-by-side PV panels and ST collectors, used to be the two main reasons why these systems are currently not as widely employed as separate, individual PV panels and ST collector equivalents [73]. The energy performance of a PV-T collector depends on the ability of the cooling fluid to extract heat from the collector. An ambitious strat - egy to boost the market uptake of this technology would be to optimize PV-T collectors to deliver thermal energy at higher temperatures (40 – 60 ◦ C), whilst mitigating thermal and electrical losses, and ensuring col - lector reliability and longevity. To this end, the main performance enhancement pathways for collector innovation include: (a) increasing the heat transfer area and/or the heat transfer coefficient between the absorber plate/tubes and the cooling fluid [122,314]; (b) adapt the PV cell technology for its integration in PV-T collectors; (c) using solar se - lective coatings [314,315]; (d) using spectral splitting techniques; and (e) increasing the thermal conductivity of the working fluid using for example nanofluids [314]. The following sections address these path - ways in detail. 3.1. Collector design modifications Several design parameters influence the performance of a PV-T col - lector, including the fluid flow rate, the inlet temperature of the working fluid, the number of covers [28], the absorber thermal properties along with the quality of the thermal contact between the cooling fluid and the absorber [121], the PV cell packing factor [27] and the collector design (e.g., tube length, pipe diameter, width to pipe diameter ( W / D ) ratio) [48,122]. Fig. 17 shows an exploded view of a typical PV-T collector, with the different layers and the following sections summarize the main research studies that consider the aforementioned parameters. 3.1.1. Glazing Several PV-T configurations exist for glazing (i.e., covering with transparent solid windows or plates) [28,120,317], specifically: un - covered, one, two (see Fig. 18) or more covers, along with different filling gases, honeycombs or transparent insulation materials (TIM), as well as evacuation [34]. The use of a cover (such as glazing) reduces thermal losses, thus increasing the thermal efficiency of the collector [121,318], but it also raises the PV cell temperature and the reflection losses, reducing the electrical efficiency [74,76,118]. A previous study concluded that a covered PV-T collector has almost double the thermal efficiency of an uncovered one, but the electrical efficiency drops by around 10% as shown in Fig. 19 [34]. Meanwhile, other studies have estimated that thermal generation increases by between 10% and 30% with the pres - ence of a cover [71,319], while the electrical output decreases by 1 – 10% [120,319]. In more recent work, the same authors reported a decrease in the first-order heat-loss coefficient ( a 1 ) from 7.07 to 2.17 W/(m 2 K) thanks to the addition of a glass cover, resulting in > 30% efficiency at collector temperatures up to 75 ◦ C [121]. However, the cover might also make the PV cells more sensitive to hot spots, and reflection losses and the higher PV cell temperature reduce electrical efficiency [76], by 10 – 20% reduction in electrical output, most notably at large solar incidence angles [121]. Similar findings were reported for a parallel-pipes PV-T collector made of aluminium alloy, with a thermal efficiency increasing from 44% to 51% with the glazing, while the electrical efficiency dropped from 14% to 13% when the PV cell tem - perature was around 38 ◦ C [126]. Regarding the number of glass covers, the results of previous research concluded that although a sheet-and-tube collector with two covers has a slightly higher thermal efficiency at elevated water tem - peratures compared to a single-cover collector, its electrical efficiency deteriorates considerably due to the second cover [120,125]. Conse - quently, a good balance is needed between the increase in thermal and Fig. 17.

Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 20 electrical efficiencies, being single-covered PV-T collectors an inter - esting option when a significant thermal output is needed [71], while the best exergy gain is found for uncovered PV-T collectors [28]. In the particular case of low-temperature water demand, the use of unglazed PV-T collectors is recommended for satisfying the demand year-round, with the hot fluid feeding the source of an HP [35,76]. Typical transparent covers are single glass sheets with a thickness of 3.2 mm [128,137,320] or 4 mm [122,317,321,322], due to their optical and mechanical properties. The glass is characterized by high trans - parency in the visible and near-infrared spectra, while it has an opaque behaviour for far-infrared wavelengths, as it is the radiation emitted by a hot surface. Meanwhile, the gap thicknesses should be thin enough to make use of the insulating properties of the filling gas, while preventing convective flows that would increase the thermal losses [36]. Different gap thicknesses have been considered in the literature: 5 mm [27], 10 mm [122,323], 20 mm [120,127,324], 25 mm [126,134,272,325] and even 40 mm [132]. A previous study analysed the impact of the gap thickness (from 4 to 40 mm) on the convection coefficient between the glazing and PV cells, as shown in Fig. 20. The minimum heat convection loss and maximum thermal efficiency are achieved for a thickness of around 11 mm when using air or argon as an encapsulant [317]. It is observed that the gap thickness has a small influence on the electrical efficiency because the optical efficiency is independent of the gap thickness. In addition to performance in terms of efficiencies, the use of glazing results in higher stagnation temperatures, which can be useful for certain applications but critical for some PV panel encapsulants [76]. For instance, EVA experiences a deterioration in its mechanical prop - erties and can become brown under UV exposure at 130 ◦ C, reducing absorption [22]. An alternative encapsulant is silicone resin [34]. Another possibility is to remove entirely the PV panel glass cover and associated EVA, in an encapsulant-free PV-T collector [22]. The feasi - bility of this solution has been demonstrated in covered PV-T collectors with dry air as filling gas [326]. Recently, two innovative PV-T collectors with overheating protection were proposed to avoid excessive stagnation temperatures: venting the collector by opening ventilation channels beneath the thermal absorber, and a switchable film that controls the heat losses by adjusting the distance between the thermal absorber and the polymer film, which substitutes the front glazing. The experimental tests show promising results, reaching a maximum stagnation temperature of 102 ◦ C and 87 ◦ C with both alternatives respectively [327]. There are also different options for filling the spacing between the cover and the PV cells. Honeycombs have been proposed to suppress natural convention and thus reduce convective heat losses [34]. TIM materials have been successfully applied to ST collectors, and it is believed their translucent properties are sufficiently good not to appreciably degrade PV cell performance [34]. Alternatively, some investigators [107,317] studied different options for the gas encapsulated between the cover and the PV cells and concluded that the use of inert gases is particularly promising as the convective heat loss on the top surface is significantly reduced; in the case of argon, the heat transfer coefficient is close to 30% lower than the equivalent for air. This leads to an improvement in the overall heat loss coefficient of around 4.8% for argon. 3.1.2. Thermal absorber As detailed in Section 2.2.1, the most widely studied thermal absorber configuration in water-based PV-T collectors is that of parallel copper tubes (sheet-and-tube), which is also the one used most commonly in commercially-available PV-T collectors [91]. In this configuration, the amount of heat that can be extracted, and thus the overall efficiency that can be achieved, depends upon the W/D ratio (where W is the distance between the pipes and D is the pipe diameter), the collector fin efficiency, and the tube bonding quality [34,72,125]. Consequently, several authors have made efforts to optimize the design of PV-T collectors by paying attention to these design aspects [120,122,125]. Fig. 18.

Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 21 Huang et al. [313] studied sheet-and-tube collectors made of different materials, such as extruded sheet-and-tube aluminium or copper tubes attached with thermally conductive adhesive to an aluminium plate, concluding that their performance is not satisfactory. Alternatively, they designed a corrugated collecting plate made of polycarbonate material to improve heat transfer, and concluded, agreeing with other studies [125, 328], that to enhance the energy performance of the PV-T collector, the absorber plate should be in direct thermal contact with the PV cells, using it as the base plate of the PV cells. Poor thermal contact results in poorer heat transfer and higher PV cell temperatures, which leads to poor electrical efficiency and, over longer periods, thermal degradation of the PV cells. Previous research reported that improvements to this thermal contact resulted in a 10 ◦ C reduction in the PV cell temperature and thus a 6 – 8% increase in electrical efficiency [121]. The heat transfer between the cooling fluid and the thermal absorber can be enhanced by increasing the contact area and by creating turbu - lence. Concerning the former, some investigators added a graphite layer with several recesses to fit the serpentine tube, to enhance the heat transfer between the pipes and thus increase heat transfer [329], while for creating turbulence, in liquid-based PV-T collectors, twisted tapes, perforated tapes, wire coils, inserts/baffle plates, grooves, or internally finned tubes have been used [330]. However, surface modifications and turbulence promoters lead to higher pressure drops, thus increasing the pumping energy consumption [314]. Any heat transfer enhancement is only promising if the gain is larger than this parasitic power increase. A better convective heat transfer between the coolant and the channels can also be achieved with reduced pipe diameter, D , and an increased number of channels per unit width (e.g., shorter W ) [331, 332]. In particular, when the W/D ratio decreases, the PV-T collector efficiency increases. The main limitation is the increase in costs and weight of the PV-T collector as the number of channels increases [36]. Typical values of the W/D ratio for sheet-and-tube collectors are 6 – 10. Alternatively, roll-bond absorbers with thin-film PV cells have been proposed (Design (b) in Fig. 21), increasing the number of pipes to 30, with a pipe distance of 0.02 m [333], along with aluminium roll-bond designs with fractal shape (FracTherm ® heat exchanger) [334,335], reporting 87% of global efficiency in controlled conditions, with a maximum thermal efficiency > 75% [334]. Similar results are found in another experimental analysis with a covered roll-bond PV-T collector, where 79% thermal efficiency was measured under PV cell operation, when the mean fluid temperature is equal to the ambient temperature, with a corresponding electrical efficiency of 8.7% [336]. He et al. [72] concluded that the collector fin efficiency and the tube-bonding quality (key design factors) can be improved using a flat-box design (Design (a) in Fig. 21). This design has been explored by several authors [72,122,134,313,337 – 341], with which the W/D ratio can be reduced to 1 when square channels are used [313], improving the fin efficiency and bonding quality, and thus significantly increasing the heat transfer area between the absorber plate and the cooling fluid. Different channel sizes have been considered: 6 × 4 mm ( W × H ) [313], 28 × 5 mm [342], 20 × 10 mm [343], or 10 × 10 mm [344], based on the results of a parametric analysis undertaken in previous research [339], which concluded that, to collect more than 90% of the energy, the collector should have a fluid layer thickness smaller than 10 mm. A numerical analysis showed that increasing the number of chan - nels from 1 to 30 improved the thermal efficiency from 42% to 49%, while the PV cell temperature decreased from 51 ◦ C to 46 ◦ C, therefore increasing the electrical efficiency [345]. This was attributed to the in - crease in the heat transfer area, so more heat can be extracted [122, 345]. In this line, the experimental results of a 20 × 10 mm covered flat-box design [343] showed daily average thermal efficiencies of 38 – 49% (higher in summer), and electrical efficiencies of 10 – 12% (higher in winter). More recent research by the authors [122] analysed 26 alternative thermal absorber designs, and the results showed that, for a constant flow rate, smaller channels lead to higher thermal effi - ciencies. This is attributed to the higher water velocity through the channels given the smaller hydraulic diameters, which leads to higher convective heat transfer coefficients. In particular, a flat-box design with 3 × 2 mm 2 rectangular channels appears to be a particularly promising alternative, achieving 4% higher optical efficiency and 15% lower linear heat-loss coefficient compared to a commercial copper sheet-and-tube PV-T collector, a while also lowering the weight (by 9%) and invest - ment cost (by 21%) of the collector. Alternatively, V-shaped grooves and/or honeycomb grooves (e.g., see Designs (c) and (d) in Fig. 21) have been proposed as means for increasing the heat transfer between the fluid and the PV layer [41,44, 346]. An experimental analysis of a polypropylene honeycomb PV-T prototype showed optical efficiencies of 0.51 without electricity gener - ation or 0.39 with electricity generation [346]. Some of these studies [72,134,337] considered extruded aluminium alloy as the thermal absorber material; while in others [122,313,338, 339], polycarbonate (PC) was proposed to lower the cost and weight of the PV-T unit. The adoption of a copolymer absorber has several ad - vantages such as a reduction in weight and thus easier installation, a simplified manufacturing process, and a lower investment cost [122, 347]. In this context, several authors [35,344] concluded that some polymeric materials, such as PC, have several properties that make them an interesting option for PV-T collectors, such as low density, mechan - ical strength, no special surface treatment required, no corrosion, ease of manufacturing at mass production as there are fewer components to assemble, and lower production cost because the material is generally cheaper and the manufacturing time is reduced. Other advantages are the freedom they offer in terms of design, as they can acquire layouts that would be very difficult and expensive using conventional materials, and the possibility to bring economies of scale to bear through, for example, extrusion processes which allow mass-production of complex geometries in lengths of kilometres [348]. Furthermore, previous LCA results [349] indicated that polymeric solar collectors appear as best as regards climatic and environmental performance when they are expressed in terms of the IPCC 100a indicator and the Ecoindicator 99, H/A indicator, respectively. Nonetheless, there are also some disadvantages associated with the use of polymeric materials [35,341], such as low thermal conductivity, large thermal expansion, and limited-service temperature. Specifically, the ideal polymer for this application should have the following prop - erties: UV protection, high thermal conductivity, water-resistant and glycol-resistant, good thermal range of utilization (  10/ + 150 ◦ C), good mechanical strength, and be chemically stable [338,339,344]. To overcome the low thermal conductivity, PV-T collector geometries can be optimized to ensure homogenous flow and maximize the contact area between the absorber and the heat transfer fluid [348]. Previous work [122] showed that a PC flat-box design with small channels (3 × 2 mm) experiences lower von Mises stress than a copper sheet-and-tube col - lector ( < 13% vs . 64% of the material ’ s yield stress), which is attributed to the larger thermal expansion of the PC thermal absorber, so this type of polymeric PV-T collectors are not expected to suffer higher strains Fig. 21. Different structures of the thermal absorber to increase heat transfer [36,42,44]. Figure reproduced based on Pang et al. [42] with permission from Elsevier (Copyright 2020 Elsevier). M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 22 than copper PV-T collectors. Loading the polymer with additives can also improve its thermal conductivity [350,351]. However, recent studies have concluded that the small improvement in the thermal performance of a polymeric flat-box PV-T collector might not outweigh the higher complexity and costs of loading the polymer with additives [122]. Another thermal absorber design proposed by Xu et al. [352] consists of two parallel thin flat-plate metal sheets, one of which is extruded by machinery mould to form arrays of mini corrugations, while the other one is attached beneath the PV cells. Both sheets are laser-welded together to form turbulent flow channels. The laboratory testing re - sults showed that this PV-T collector can achieve an electrical efficiency of 17% and a thermal efficiency of nearly 65% at standard testing conditions (STC). The best manufacturing process that would ensure the ideal thermal contact between the thermal absorber and the fluid is to laminate the whole package of the top cover, PV cells, and a flat absorber together in one step [353]. In this case, an electrically insulating foil can be inter - posed between the PV cell and the absorber in the lamination process, or an electrically insulating coating can be applied to the absorber ’ s top surface [34]. Recent research showed that laminating the solar cells directly to a copper metal thermal absorber can reduce the thermal resistance by around 10% thanks to the effective heat transfer from the PV cells to the heat transfer fluid [354]. Another solution is to deposit the PV material directly on the absorber, with an insulating coating or galvanic separation between cells, as applied to the a-Si cells. 3.1.3. PV surface The effective utilization of the surface area of a collector that is exposed to solar radiation is of primary importance and interest. When the PV cells are placed above the thermal absorber section to achieve high electrical performance, the presence of the cells leads to a reduction of the heat flux into the collector fluid circuit, reducing the thermal efficiency [132]. Previous studies [27,328,355] investigated the trade-off between larger coverage areas for increased electricity gener - ation and smaller coverage areas when the priority is hot water pro - duction. The simulation results of a validated dynamic system model showed that the higher the covering factor and the glazing trans - missivity, the better the overall performance [325]. Zakharchenko et al. [328] concluded that the solar PV cells area should be smaller than the absorber size, and that the PV cells should be located where the coolant enters the collector. This is due to the reduction of the heat flux to the solar collector when the PV cells are located above the absorber, thus reducing the collector ’ s thermal effi - ciency. Furthermore, as the coolant/fluid ’ s temperature increases, the rate of heat extraction from the PV cells. As a consequence, as the area covered with PV cells increases, the panel cooling decreases, impairing one of the core advantages of hybrid PV-T or conventional PV systems [328]. Other studies [355] concluded that depending on the user needs, PV-T collectors should be partially covered by PV cells when the priority is hot water production or fully covered when the priority is electricity generation. More recent research [27] concluded that for the case of the UK, complete coverage of the solar collector with PV cells leads to the coverage of a higher fraction of the annual electricity demand while maximizing the CO 2 emission savings. In addition, economic assess - ments of PV-T collectors with different covering factors showed that the lowest payback time and levelized production costs are achieved by fully covered collectors [91]. In summary, research to-date has shown that partially covered col - lectors can achieve better thermal efficiencies (with the PV cells located near the collector fluid inlet), while fully covered PV-T collectors enable maximum electricity generation but lower thermal yields. However, one should bear in mind that this trade-off is sensitive to the solar and environmental conditions at the geographical location of the installa - tion, and that the overall preferred designs require that the relative value of the electrical and thermal outputs are known. 3.1.4. Phase-change materials Increasing efforts are being made in the context of integrating PCMs with PV cells and modules. In early work, investigators considered the integration of PCMs with PV cells (PV-PCM) as a solution for limiting the temperature rise in BIPV systems [356]. If designed appropriately, PCMs can offer not only temperature reduction of PV cells, but also compact thermal storage with a stable temperature [357]. Previous work was extensively focussed on using PCMs only for the thermal regulation of PV cells [239], in which the electrical output is the sole design target [358]. The typical design of such PV-PCM systems is by integrating PCMs at the rear side of PV cells. The high thermal storage capacity of PCMs can shave the peak temperature of PV cells, leading to a more stable and flatter operation temperature, which is thus beneficial for efficiency and lifetime. Paraffin wax with melting temperatures around 25 – 35 ◦ C has been extensively employed in PV-PCM systems [239,359 – 362]. It was reported that the peak temperature drop of PV panels can be as high as 20 ◦ C [363, 364], and an average electrical efficiency improvement of around 1 – 8% is attainable [365,366]. Other studies [367] used a water-saturated micro - encapsulated PCM layer as a passive thermal management medium for a BIPV panel. However, as the purpose of the above studies was to limit the temperature rise of PV cells, the phase-transition temperature of the applied PCMs was typically close to ambient temperature and thus the stored thermal energy was of low value. More recently, researchers explored the possibilities of using PCMs for both electrical and thermal performance improvements of PV-T systems, forming the so-called PV-T-PCM systems. The design consid - erations of such systems are very similar to those in PV-PCM systems, but the desired phase-transition temperature could be higher to increase the usefulness of the collected heat. Studies observed that with an additional stable useful thermal output, the electrical efficiency of the PV-T col - lector can also be improved when integrating with PCMs. Some authors [368] proposed a PV-T-PCM hot water system. Numerical results showed that, by including an appropriate PCM in an optimized system, the PV cell output can be increased by typically 9% with an average water temperature rise of 20 ◦ C. Experiments on PV-T-PCM collectors under clear sunny days at Mashhad (Iran) [369] showed that the elec - trical efficiency is improved by about 10% with additional thermal output at temperatures of 40 – 50 ◦ C accounting for around 5.5 × the electrical output. In another work [370], it was found that the PV-T-PCM collector performed better in comparison with conventional PV-T col - lectors in terms of electrical efficiency, but the maximum thermal effi - ciency was slightly lower. Other authors [371] conducted experimental comparisons of a PV-T-PCM hot water system and a standard PV-T hot water system. Using fatty acid eutectic, capric-palmitic as the PCM, it was found that the PV-T-PCM system was able to maintain the water at a higher temperature for an extended period of time (by 100%). Building-integrated PV-T-PCM collectors emerge as a promising technology for ventilation and space heating. A ceiling ventilation sys - tem integrated with a PV-T-PCM collector was proposed [372], where the air was used as the heat transfer medium between the PV cells and the two PCM layers. The indoor thermal comfort of the building was significantly improved with a maximum air temperature rise of 23 ◦ C. Low-temperature PCMs are typically characterized by their low thermal conductivity, which limits the heat transfer performance for charging and discharging heat, further influencing both the thermal and electrical performance of PV-T-PCM collectors. Adding nanoparticles with high thermal conductivity into a PCM enhances its heat transfer performance, forming the so-called nano-enhanced PCM (NePCM). Several studies have explored the performance potential of PV-T-NePCM using different nanoparticles, including SiC [373,374], graphene nano - platelets (GNP) [375], Al 2 O 3 [376,377], multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) [378], or CuO [379], as summarized in Table 6. Although the performance improvement of PV-T-NePCM collectors compared to PV-T-PCM, PV-T and PV panels varies in different studies and operation conditions, previous work demonstrated that adding nanoparticles into the PCMs can improve the thermal and electrical efficiencies, so this has M. Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 23 emerged as a promising direction. In practice, the selection of the appropriate PCMs depends on many factors, including the desired temperature of thermal output, weather conditions, or weighting between electrical and thermal efficiencies. Trade-offs are always needed between the thermal and electrical out - puts. It is estimated that PV-T-PCM collectors have a TRL of around 5 – 6 without any PV-T-PCM collector manufacturer yet. As the integration of PCMs increases the capital costs and system complexity of PV-T collec - tors compared to conventional PV-T collectors without PCMs, the cost- competitiveness of PV-T-PCM collectors needs to be improved to make them practically more attractive. 3.1.5. Aerogels Aerogels are an emerging material in the field of PV-T technology that have been attracting significant attention in other research fields, such as building thermal-insulation windows [380], solar-thermal receivers [381], space launch applications [382]. Highly-transparent silica aero - gels are a type of emerging thermal insulation material capable of reducing the heat loss of PV-T collectors [383]. Silica aerogel materials have low thermal conductivities and high transmittance (96% [383] and > 80% [384], respectively). The highly-transparent aerogel layer is usu - ally added on the top surface of a PV-T collector to reduce the heat loss with a slight impact on the electrical efficiency, as shown in Fig. 22. The modelling work by Wu et al. [385] shows that the heat loss of a PV-T collector covered with a 20-mm-thick silica aerogel layer is only 140 W/m 2 when the operating temperature is 70 ◦ C, which is significantly smaller than that of a conventional covered PV-T collector (heat loss of 300 W/m 2 ). Therefore, the thermal efficiency of the aerogel-glazing PV-T collector is significantly improved, by 46%. The electrical efficiency of the aerogel-glazing PV-T collector is similar to that of a covered PV-T collector, as the transmittance of the aerogel layer is close to that of the glass layer (see Table 7). Overall, the exergy efficiency is improved by 17%, while the total cost of the aerogel-glazing PV-T collector is only 1.4% higher than the conventional covered PV-T collector [385]. An aerogel-glazed PV-T collector was built and tested by Weinstein et al. [383]. The 10-mm-thick aerogel layer had a solar-weighted transmittance of 96%, which is higher than the glass transmittance normally used for PV-T collectors, and low thermal conductivity (see Table 7), thus effectively reducing heat losses, especially at high oper - ating temperatures. The compressive and flexural strength of the silica aerogel were around 3 MPa and 0.2 MPa, which is strong enough for PV-T applications. Comprehensive mathematical models of aerogel-glazed PV-T collectors were introduced by Du et al. [386] and Wen et al. [387]. It is expected that the rapid development of aerogel technology will promote the further development of high-performance PV-T technologies. 3.2. Next-generation PV cell technology The PV cells used in all current, commercially available PV-T col - lector products, but also more state-of-the-art collectors currently under development, are designed for PV (i.e., pure electricity-generation) ap - plications, such that their optical and electrical designs (e.g., surface structure) and fabrication methods are optimized to maximize electrical generation without any consideration to thermal generation. This is beneficial for PV applications, but detrimental when used in PV-T col - lectors, as the thermal energy recovered (and, ultimately, delivered) by the latter will also have a value. Secondly, there is a further design conflict between the electrical and thermal performance of PV-T col - lectors, and a trade-off is needed depending on the end-user needs and the local environmental and economic conditions. Specifically, as mentioned in Section 1.2, the efficiency of PV cells decreases with temperature, so the cooling fluid of the PV-T collectors should be kept at a lower temperature when the electrical output is the main priority. This constraint for the heat transfer fluid to exit the collector at low tem - peratures imposes a limit on its posterior use for heating purposes. On the contrary, if the PV-T collectors are operated at higher fluid tem - peratures, then the electrical efficiency decreases. Therefore, there is a design conflict between the electrical and thermal performance of hybrid PV-T collectors, and a trade-off is needed depending on the end- user needs and the local solar and environmental conditions. In an attempt to solve this conflict, different types of next-generation PV cell technologies have been analysed for their integration in PV-T collectors, Table 6 Summary of recent studies on PV-T-NePCM systems.

Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 24 including innovative PV cell technologies, as detailed below. 3.2.1. Performance aspects Silicon technologies hold the largest market share by a large margin (94% in 2019 [388]) with a large number of manufacturers mainly based in China, followed by cadmium telluride (CdTe) thin-film prin - cipally manufactured by First Solar, then copper indium gallium sele - nide (CIGS) principally manufactured by Solar Frontier. Fig. 23(a) shows the relative power output ( P ( T )) for a series of different solar cell technologies, two variants of c-Si (the present market leader), CIGS, silicon heterojunction (SHJ) (a high-performance variant of c-Si), gallium arsenide (GaAs) and CdTe. All the cells lose power with increased temperature, but the degree to which power is lost depends on some fundamental cell properties that can help guide the choice of a PV- T system (see Section 1.2). Illustrative temperature dependencies for a silicon solar cell are shown in Fig. 23(b). The temperature coefficient of power ( β Pmax ) is given by the gradient of the lines shown in Fig. 23(b). Hence different silicon PV technologies can exhibit quite different temperature coefficients, indicated by the data shown in Fig. 24, where the SHJ cell achieves the lowest temperature coefficient due to an elevated cell voltage. Some studies [28] concluded that the thermal performance of PV-T collectors based on c-Si cells is comparable to that of a-Si cells, while others [71,135]) obtained higher thermal efficiencies for water-based PV-T collectors with a-Si (~60% at zero reduced temperature) than for PV-T collectors with pc-Si (~55% at zero reduced temperature). Thin-film technologies, such as hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si: H), appear as an interesting alternative thanks to their low manufacturing costs (about 1.5 USD/kW p ), low embodied energy per watt peak [393], less brittle and easiness to be attached to different surfaces including printable laminate. However, the electrical efficiency is lower (around 5 – 7%) [127,394] and it uses heavy metals that reduce its usage [395]. This shows that so far there are discrepancies about which PV cell type is better to use in a PV-T collector. It is believed that the choice should be made according to the specific end-user needs, being inter - esting the use of a-Si when high thermal efficiency is required, while when the main priority is electricity generation, pc-Si can be a more suitable option. Previous authors [328] concluded that the use of con - ventional PV cells is not appropriate for their integration in PV-T col - lectors as they have poor thermal conductivity in the rear surface which hinders the efficient heat extraction by the solar collectors. Hence, a modification of the commercial PV panel is needed to provide the col - lector with a good substrate material such as aluminium. 3.2.2. Tandem cells A popular and nowadays well-understood means for augmenting the efficiency of a PV cell is to use several solar cells with different band- gaps to selectively absorb different parts of the solar spectrum. This preserves a larger fraction of the free energy in the incident sunlight and uniquely for PV-T collectors also offers the possibility of directing light that is unproductive for electrical power generation to a thermal absorber. Three configurations of this approach are shown in Fig. 25. The monolithic and multi-terminal approaches make use of the property that a semiconductor becomes comparatively transparent for photon energies below the band-gap by cascading the band-gap energy from high energy to low naturally sorts photons into the appropriate sub-cells. In the case of the spectrum splitting configuration, the sorting of photons is achieved using a dichroic mirror, allowing long- wavelength photons to pass through while directing shorter wave - length photons to a suitable low band-gap solar cell. To evaluate the performance of these two separate approaches we Fig. 23. (a) Relative power loss with temperature for different solar cell technologies.

Herrando et al.\nProgress in Energy and Combustion Science 97 (2023) 101072 25 note that Configurations (b) and (c) in Fig. 25 are geometrical permu - tations of the same approach and have similar limiting efficiencies. The only difference is that the opportunity for radiative coupling between sub-cells, whereby any radiative emission from the high-gap cell through Process (4) in Fig. 2(b) is lost in the case of the spectrum splitting Configuration (c) of Fig. 25, whereas it is transmitted into lower-lying junctions [396] in: (a) the monolithic; and (b) multi-terminal tandem configurations shown in Fig. 25. The efficiency for monolithic and multi-terminal tandems is plotted in Fig. 26 along with the two limiting cases for the solar cell configu - ration depicted in Fig. 2(c): (i) where only light in the semiconductor is absorbed or (ii) where the full solar spectrum is absorbed. In these cal - culations, the cell is maintained at 300 K, hence only the thermal gen - eration varies depending on whether solar absorption only takes place in the semiconductor (Fig. 26(i)) or the full solar spectrum is absorbed (Fig. 26(ii)). In the case of semiconductor absorption only (Fig. 26(i)), similar peak electrical efficiencies can be obtained with either high or low thermal generation. With full solar absorption (Fig. 26(ii)) the peak electrical efficiency will always coincide with the minimum electrical generation. 3.3. Selective coatings Another way to enhance the energy performance of PV-T collectors is to maximize the solar irradiance harnessed through the application of coat - ings on the absorber surface [314,315]. Conventional solar thermal col - lectors are carefully engineered to have strong absorptivity for solar wavelengths yet minimal emissivity at the operating thermal wavelengths, typically > 7 μ m [397]. As discussed in Section 1.2, silicon PV cells have strong absorptivity from UV to mid-IR, but from wavelengths larger than 5 μ m, the emissivity of the solar module is dominated by the module glass [29]. Fig. 27 shows the absorptivity and emissivity from a silicon PV panel with cover glass, unencapsulated, confirming the high emissivity at wavelengths where radiative loss at 60 ◦ C will take place [22]. These losses can be mitigated by using low-emissivity coatings, similar to those used on energy-efficient windows [398]. Typically these coatings are made from transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) where reflectivity is high above the plasma frequency for example indium tin oxide (ITO) and aluminium zinc oxide (AZO) [399,400]. Applying an AZO film onto a double-glazed flat-plate collector achieved a thermal emissivity of 0.3 yet retaining a solar transmittance of 0.85 [401]. A more recent multi-layered coating achieved an emissivity of 0.13 and solar transmittance > 0.8 [402]. TCOs have a much higher transmittance compared to silver-based coatings [401], typical films used in an effi - cient glazing are In 2 O 3 :Sn (ITO), TiO 2 :Nb, ZnO:Al [403]. The consequences of controlling the PV-T collector emissivity are dramatic. Fig. 28 shows the projected annual thermal yield from different configurations of PV-T collectors with different thermal emis - sivities and module filling compared to a standard ETC. To reach high- temperature applications, such as air-conditioning using absorption chillers, achieving low emissivity is critical. The PV-T collector heat evacuation then becomes a critical factor to reduce convective thermal losses [22]. Optical coatings can also be used to control the colour of a PV panel, although this can only be achieved by reflecting what would otherwise be productive sunlight from the PV-T collector back towards the observer [404]. Normally, PV-T collectors are configured for optimum electrical and thermal outputs, but in the case of BIPV-T systems, the visual appeal of the system becomes an important consideration so impaired electrical and thermal performance might be tolerable [405]. 3.4.

  "text": " Ecco un riassunto in italiano di 1000 parole dei due documenti:\n\nI due documenti analizzano lo stato dell'arte dei collettori solari ibridi fotovoltaico-termici (PV-T). Questi collettori combinano pannelli fotovoltaici (PV) per la generazione di energia elettrica con un assorbitore termico per la produzione di calore, utilizzando la stessa area di apertura. \n\nIl primo documento presenta una panoramica delle diverse configurazioni di collettori PV-T:\n\n- A base d'aria: utilizzano l'aria come fluido termovettore per raffreddare le celle PV. Sono economici ma hanno efficienze più basse. Le configurazioni più comuni sono con o senza vetro di copertura, con diversi tipi di canali d'aria.\n\n- A base di liquido: utilizzano acqua o glicole come fluido termovettore. Hanno costi più alti ma efficienze migliori. Le configurazioni più comuni hanno tubi paralleli saldati su una piastra assorbitrice. \n\n- Ibridi aria-acqua: combinano i vantaggi dei sistemi ad aria e ad acqua.\n\n- A tubi calore: utilizzano tubi calore per estrarre il calore dalle celle PV. \n\n- PV-T a materiale a cambiamento di fase (PCM): integrano i PCM nel collettore per immagazzinare il calore.\n\n- Integrati negli edifici: integrati in facciate o tetti degli edifici.\n\n- A concentrazione (CPV-T): utilizzano lenti o specchi per concentrare la radiazione solare sulle celle PV.\n\nIl documento analizza poi le potenzialità per migliorare le prestazioni dei collettori PV-T, come cellule PV di nuova generazione, rivestimenti selettivi, suddivisione spettrale della radiazione solare e nanofluidi.\n\nInfine, vengono presentate varie applicazioni dei sistemi PV-T:\n\n- Sistemi per la cogenerazione di calore ed elettricità.\n\n- Sistemi di raffreddamento solare. \n\n- Sistemi di cogenerazione di freddo, calore ed elettricità.\n\n- Sistemi di dissalazione dell'acqua.\n\n- Sistemi di essiccamento solare.\n\n- Produzione di idrogeno.\n\nIl secondo documento si concentra su:\n\n- Collettori PV-T a concentrazione (CPV-T): utilizzano specchi o lenti per concentrare la radiazione solare. Hanno alte efficienze ma costi elevati.\n\n- Collettori PV-T integrati negli edifici: integrati in facciate o tetti. Importanti per l'ambiente urbano.\n\n- Miglioramenti al design del collettore: ottimizzazione delle coperture, dell'assorbitore termico e della superficie PV. I collettori a scatola piatta hanno alte prestazioni.\n\n- Integrazione di PCM e aerogel: permettono di immagazzinare il calore e ridurre le perdite di calore.\n\n- Tecnologie PV innovative: le celle PV attuali sono progettate per massimizzare la produzione elettrica, non quella termica. Servono celle ottimizzate per i collettori PV-T.\n\n- Rivestimenti selettivi: permettono di massimizzare l'assorbimento della radiazione solare e minimizzare l'emissione di calore.\n\n- Suddivisione spettrale: suddivide lo spettro solare, indirizzando le lunghezze d'onda non produttive per la parte elettrica verso l'assorbitore termico.\n\nInfine, il documento valuta il potenziale di mitigazione delle emissioni di CO2 dei sistemi PV-T, stimando che potrebbero ridurre le emissioni globali del 16% nel 2030, se la loro diffusione venisse promossa. \n\nI documenti concludono che i collettori PV-T rappresentano una soluzione promettente per sfruttare in modo più efficiente la radiazione solare, soprattutto negli ambienti urbani. Tuttavia, sono necessari ulteriori miglioramenti tecnologici e riduzioni di costo per aumentarne la diffusione.",
