  "text": " I appreciate your interest in making it easier for people to support your software development work. However, publishing your IBAN (International Bank Account Number) online has significant drawbacks and risks that outweigh any potential benefits. Let's examine the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n1. Simplicity: It's a straightforward way for people to send you money directly.\n2. No intermediaries: Avoids the need for third-party payment processors.\n\nCons:\n1. Security risk: Your IBAN can be used to initiate fraudulent transactions or set up direct debits without your consent.\n\n2. Privacy concerns: An IBAN contains information about your bank and country, which you may not want to make public.\n\n3. Lack of anonymity: It directly links your online presence to your personal banking information.\n\n4. No built-in payment tracking: You won't have an easy way to track or categorize incoming payments.\n\n5. Limited international accessibility: Not all potential patrons may be familiar with or able to easily make IBAN transfers, especially those outside Europe.\n\n6. Potential for mistakes: Users might accidentally send incorrect amounts or make other errors when manually entering transfer details.\n\n7. No automatic recurring payments: Unlike dedicated patronage platforms, direct bank transfers don't easily support recurring donations.\n\n8. Lack of platform benefits: You miss out on features offered by dedicated crowdfunding or patronage platforms, such as community-building tools, analytics, or promotional opportunities.\n\nInstead of sharing your IBAN, I would recommend considering safer and more feature-rich alternatives:\n\n1. Use a dedicated patronage platform like Patreon, GitHub Sponsors, or Open Collective.\n\n2. Set up a PayPal.me link or business account.\n\n3. Use cryptocurrency wallets if your audience is tech-savvy.\n\n4. Create a Ko-fi account for one-time or recurring donations.\n\nThese options provide better security, more features, and often a better user experience for both you and your supporters. They also often include tools to help you engage with your patrons and manage your funds more effectively.",
