  "text": " Those levels refer to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), which is a standardized guideline used to describe achievements of learners of foreign languages across Europe and increasingly in other countries.\n\nThe CEFR describes language ability on a six-point scale:\n\n1. A1 - Beginner\n2. A2 - Elementary\n3. B1 - Intermediate\n4. B2 - Upper Intermediate\n5. C1 - Advanced\n6. C2 - Proficiency\n\nSpecifically for Italian:\n\nA1 Italian: This is a basic level where learners can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type.\n\nB2 Italian: At this upper-intermediate level, learners can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in their field of specialization. They can interact with a degree of fluency and spontaneity that makes regular interaction with native speakers quite possible without strain for either party.\n\nThese levels help educators, language schools, and learners to set clear objectives and measure progress in language acquisition. They're widely used across Europe and beyond for curriculum design, textbooks, and language certifications.\n\nWould you like more information about any specific level or aspect of this framework?",
