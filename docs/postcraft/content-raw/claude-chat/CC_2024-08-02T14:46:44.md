  "text": " There are several natural fly repellents you can use:\n\n1. Essential oils: Flies dislike certain scents, including lavender, eucalyptus, peppermint, and lemongrass.\n\n2. Herbs: Growing or placing basil, mint, or marigolds around your space can help repel flies.\n\n3. Vinegar and dish soap trap: Mix apple cider vinegar with a few drops of dish soap to attract and trap flies.\n\n4. Citrus: Flies don't like the smell of lemons, limes, or oranges. You can use peels or oils.\n\n5. Cayenne pepper: Mixing cayenne pepper with water in a spray bottle can deter flies.\n\n6. Natural predators: Encouraging natural fly predators like birds or planting carnivorous plants can help control fly populations.\n\n7. Cloves: The scent of cloves is off-putting to flies. You can stick cloves into a lemon or orange for a natural repellent.\n\n8. Camphor: Burning camphor oil or using camphor-based products can repel flies.\n\nThese methods are generally safer and more environmentally friendly than chemical repellents. Would you like more information on any of these or how to use them effectively?",
