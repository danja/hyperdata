  "text": " I'd be happy to explain how to use JSDoc comments for type-checking in pure JavaScript. This approach can indeed improve your development experience when you can't use TypeScript directly. Here's a breakdown of how you would implement this in practice:\n\n1. JSDoc Type Annotations:\n   You use JSDoc comments to add type information to your JavaScript code. These comments start with `/**` and end with `*/`.\n\n2. Variable and Function Annotations:\n   You can annotate variables and functions with their expected types.\n\n   For example:\n\n   ```javascript\n   /** @type {string} */\n   let name = \"Claude\";\n\n   /**\n    * @param {number} a\n    * @param {number} b\n    * @returns {number}\n    */\n   function add(a, b) {\n     return a + b;\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. Complex Types:\n   You can define more complex types using JSDoc tags.\n\n   ```javascript\n   /**\n    * @typedef {Object} Person\n    * @property {string} name\n    * @property {number} age\n    */\n\n   /** @type {Person} */\n   const person = { name: \"Alice\", age: 30 };\n   ```\n\n4. IDE Integration:\n   Many modern IDEs (like Visual Studio Code) can recognize these JSDoc comments and provide type checking, autocompletion, and other TypeScript-like features.\n\n5. Type Checking:\n   You can use tools like TypeScript compiler (in check-only mode) or other static analysis tools to perform type checking based on these JSDoc comments.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of using JSDoc for type checking in JavaScript? For instance, I could provide more examples of complex type annotations or explain how to set up your development environment to leverage these comments effectively.",
