  "text": " I understand you're looking for a concise way to describe developers who choose their profession out of passion or enjoyment rather than necessity. Here are some possibilities that might capture what you're looking for:\n\n1. Hobbyist developers\n2. Enthusiast developers\n3. Avocation developers\n4. Recreational developers\n5. Passion-driven developers\n6. Self-motivated developers\n7. Amateur developers (in the sense of doing it for love, not lack of skill)\n8. Vocation developers\n\nThe term \"hobbyist\" is quite common in this context, but some of the others might fit your specific needs better. Do any of these resonate with what you're trying to express? If not, I can try to generate more options or we can refine the concept further.",

  "text": " You're right, \"elective\" is an excellent choice for the concept you're describing. Here's a definition:\n\nElective (adjective):\n1. Chosen or voluntary; not required or obligatory.\n2. (Of a course of study) Optional; selected by choice rather than as a requirement.\n\nIn the context of \"elective developers,\" it would mean developers who have chosen to engage in development work voluntarily, as opposed to those who do it out of necessity or obligation. This term effectively captures the idea of people pursuing development by choice, emphasizing their agency and willingness in the activity.\n\nThe word \"elective\" is often used in educational contexts (e.g., elective courses), medical fields (e.g., elective surgery), and can be applied to various situations where people make a deliberate choice to participate in or pursue something.\n\nUsing \"elective developers\" nicely conveys the idea of people who code or develop software because they want to, not because they have to.",

  "text": " Ah, I see. You're looking for a more general term that's often used in other contexts to express voluntary participation. Given that description, I think I know the word you're searching for. Is it \"avocational\"?\n\n\"Avocational developers\" would describe people who engage in development as a secondary activity, done by choice rather than as a primary profession or out of necessity.\n\nIf that's not quite it, here are a few other possibilities that might fit the bill:\n\n1. Discretionary developers\n2. Elective developers\n3. Optional developers\n4. Volitional developers\n\nThese terms all emphasize the element of choice. However, I suspect \"avocational\" might be the word you're trying to recall, as it's often used in various contexts to describe activities people engage in voluntarily, separate from their main occupation or duty.\n\nDoes \"avocational\" match what you were trying to remember? If not, please let me know, and I can try to think of more options or we can explore the concept further.",
