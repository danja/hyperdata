  "text": " Based on the provided content and my understanding of the project, here's a description for a movie poster that captures the essence of the story:\n\n\"A futuristic robotic figure with glowing blue circuits stands in the center, surrounded by a vibrant, colorful landscape. The robot's eyes are fixed on a small, cute animal in the distance. Scattered around are various objects: a glowing crystal, a mysterious door, and floating geometric shapes. The background transitions from a digital grid pattern to a lush forest. Above, the title 'ilo li wile e soweli' appears in a sleek, futuristic font. The poster should have a dreamlike quality, blending technology and nature.\"\n\nThis description aims to capture the key elements of the story: the robot protagonist, its quest for the animal, and the various environments and objects encountered along the way.\n\nQ1: How should the contrast between technology and nature be emphasized in the poster?\nQ2: What specific animal would best represent the 'soweli' in the story?\nQ3: Should any human characters be included in the poster design?",
