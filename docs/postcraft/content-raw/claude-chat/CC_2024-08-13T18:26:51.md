  "text": " To set up port forwarding for Wake-on-LAN (WoL) and SSH access from your remote server to your desktop computer, you'll need to configure your home router. Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. Wake-on-LAN setup:\n   - Ensure your desktop's network card supports WoL and it's enabled in the BIOS.\n   - Configure your desktop to keep the network card powered on when the system is off.\n\n2. Find your desktop's MAC address and local IP:\n   - Open a terminal on your desktop and run: `ifconfig` or `ip addr`\n   - Note down the MAC address and local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)\n\n3. Router configuration:\n   a) WoL port forwarding:\n      - Forward UDP port 9 (standard WoL port) to your desktop's IP address\n   \n   b) SSH port forwarding:\n      - Forward TCP port 22 (standard SSH port) to your desktop's IP address\n   \n   c) (Optional) Use a non-standard port for SSH:\n      - For better security, you can use a non-standard port (e.g., 2222) and forward it to port 22 on your desktop\n\n4. Configure your router's Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service:\n   - This gives you a domain name that always points to your home's public IP address\n\n5. On your remote server:\n   a) To wake up your desktop:\n      - Install a WoL tool (e.g., `wakeonlan` or `etherwake`)\n      - Use the command: `wakeonlan -i your_home_public_ip_or_ddns MAC_ADDRESS`\n\n   b) To SSH into your desktop:\n      - Wait a minute for the desktop to boot up\n      - SSH using: `ssh username@your_home_public_ip_or_ddns -p 22` (or your custom port)\n\nHere are some additional considerations:\n\n1. Security: \n   - Use strong passwords and consider key-based authentication for SSH.\n   - Consider using a VPN instead of port forwarding for added security.\n\n2. Router specific:\n   - The exact steps for port forwarding vary by router. Check your router's manual or online guides.\n\n3. Firewall:\n   - Ensure your desktop's firewall allows incoming connections on the SSH port.\n\n4. Testing:\n   - Test your setup from within your home network first, then from outside.\n\n5. IP address changes:\n   - If your home IP changes frequently, make sure to keep your DDNS updated.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any part of this setup?",

  "text": "Ubuntu networking question. I have a desktop computer connected to my home LAN. The Lan is connected via a router. I also have a remote server connected to the internet with a fixed ip. I would like to be able to connect from a terminal in the remote server such that I can trigger wake-on-lan on the desktop, then SSH in.  How do I configure port forwarding to achieve this?",
