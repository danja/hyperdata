  "text": " Based on your description, a few words come to mind that could fit what you're looking for:\n\n1. Lewd\n2. Lecherous \n3. Salacious\n4. Lascivious\n5. Prurient\n\nThese words all describe liking or being interested in something in a sexual or inappropriate way, with slightly different connotations. \"Lewd\" is perhaps the most common of these in everyday speech.\n\nDo any of these match the word you were trying to recall? If not, I can suggest some others or try to help narrow it down further.",

  "text": " Ah, \"fetishism\" - that's indeed a more specific term than the ones I suggested. Good that you remembered it. \n\nFetishism refers to a form of sexual desire in which gratification is linked to an abnormal degree to a particular object, body part, or activity. It's often used in a broader sense to describe an excessive or irrational commitment to something.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about this concept or related terminology?",
