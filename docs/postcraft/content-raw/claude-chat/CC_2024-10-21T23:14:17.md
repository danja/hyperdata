  "text": " To download an area of a website using wget, you can use the following command:\n\n```\nwget -r -np -k -p https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/\n```\n\nHere's what each option does:\n\n- `-r`: Enables recursive retrieval\n- `-np`: No parent - don't ascend to the parent directory\n- `-k`: Convert links to make them suitable for local viewing\n- `-p`: Download all necessary files for displaying HTML pages\n\nThis command will download all the files under the specified URL, creating a local copy of that section of the website.\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these options in more detail or provide information on additional useful wget options for this task?",
