  "text": " Here's a polite and friendly way to say \"I'm sorry for not getting back to you\" in Italian:\n\n\"Mi dispiace di non averti risposto prima.\"\n\nThis translates literally to \"I'm sorry for not having answered you before.\"\n\nTo make it even friendlier, you could add:\n\n\"Spero tu possa perdonarmi.\"\n\nThis means \"I hope you can forgive me.\"\n\nSo the full phrase would be:\n\"Mi dispiace di non averti risposto prima. Spero tu possa perdonarmi.\"\n\nWould you like me to break down the pronunciation or explain any part of this phrase?",
