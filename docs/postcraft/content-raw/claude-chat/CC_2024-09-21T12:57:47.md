  "text": " The official doctrine of the Catholic Church is called \"magisterium.\"\n\nThe magisterium refers to the teaching authority of the Catholic Church, exercised by the Pope and the bishops in communion with him. It encompasses the official teachings on faith, morals, and religious practices that Catholics are expected to follow.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspects of the magisterium or Catholic doctrine?",

  "text": " The concept you're referring to is called \"transubstantiation\" in Catholic theology. This doctrine states that during the Eucharist (also known as Holy Communion or Mass), the bread and wine literally become the body and blood of Christ, while retaining their outward appearance.\n\nFor a good reference on this topic, you might want to look at:\n\n1. The Catechism of the Catholic Church: This official document provides a comprehensive explanation of Catholic beliefs, including transubstantiation. Specifically, paragraphs 1373-1381 deal with this topic.\n\n2. The Council of Trent (1545-1563): This council reaffirmed and clarified the doctrine of transubstantiation in response to Protestant Reformation challenges. The decrees from Session 13 are particularly relevant.\n\n3. Thomas Aquinas' \"Summa Theologica\": This medieval theological work provides an in-depth philosophical and theological explanation of transubstantiation.\n\n4. The Gospel accounts of the Last Supper: Matthew 26:26-28, Mark 14:22-24, Luke 22:19-20, and 1 Corinthians 11:23-25 provide the biblical basis for this belief.\n\n5. Encyclical \"Mysterium Fidei\" (1965) by Pope Paul VI: This document reaffirms and explains the doctrine of transubstantiation in modern times.\n\nThese sources provide authoritative explanations of the Catholic understanding of transubstantiation from different perspectives - official Church teaching, historical context, philosophical reasoning, and scriptural basis.",
