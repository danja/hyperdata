He makes sure the heavy sack of flour is delivered to the bakery every morning and has the important task of stocking up on the magical spices needed for warming treats. \n\nI polished the grammar, smoothed out awkward phrasings, and improved word choice throughout.

Add honey, yolk, flour, baking soda and Christmas spices.  Knead everything together, then wrap the dough in plastic wrap and leave it in the fridge for half an hour. Then we need to roll it out to a thickness of 5 millimeters and cut out the cookies with cookie cutters. Place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and put the tray in an oven heated to 350°F (180°C). Bake the cookies until golden brown and let them cool completely on their own.  \n\nIf you want, you can mix 100 grams of powdered sugar with a little water to make a white glaze for decorating the cooled cookies.\n\nI continued polishing the translation, fixing grammar issues and improving word choice and phrasing.

His eyes and nose were made of a piece of cloth sewn over the burnt places in the handles, and above them protruded a fork and spoon from a salad set. It sounded a lot like Los -Nice song! Lost said\n\nFrom Good day!! - jumped up\n\nBucksumko\n\n- I'm not so sure it's a good day!\n\n- Snow storm!? Great! Let's go out and see! - under no circumstances! My grandmother used to tell me how in a terrible blizzard she went outside... and no one saw her again. A kak mu zo e pazkazala, as no one saw her again? - Biscuitko was surprised.\n\n15\n\nThere's a snowstorm outside!\n\nLosm looked at him embarrassed, then indignantly\n\n- the important thing is that it's cold and scary outside\n\n- It's not scary outside at all! Let's go out yes\n\nfinally shot:\n\nWe see how cold it is!\n\n- Absurd! Lost jumped up\n\n- Well, look out the window! Look how much snow there is, I can't wait to get out! Come on! Adventures await us, of which\n\nit will make your hair stand on end! - Oh, no, no, no! I don't get goosebumps at all! I am very cold I cannot walk in such a storm for no reason! In order to go outside, I have to... I have to have a purpose!\n\n- goal? Good! Now I'll think of a purpose for you... I'll think of so many reasons that... Cookie was pacing up and down the table, and Losm\n\nranked under Hoca cu:\n\n- we'll go outside, I'll catch a cold and I'll sneeze... and if I sneeze, it's okay\n\nI'm getting sick!\n\n*\n\nwith Christmas bickBumkul\n\nthe biscuit man\n\n- Mom? - Lost is frozen, and then\n\n- This is our goal - toasted food now without Christmas cookies for Christmas!!!\n\n-Xalige valige! We have a goal!\n\n- Here we have a cucak-page ao Suidunicacaka for flour - said also Pransport Tomberl\n\n-carga kaka-wrapvka kako blank pe\n\nCookie and the Moose started doing exercises. This included climbing shelves, running on a tray, push-ups with a stirrer, sit-ups on the handle of an oven and massage with a ka-grinder... Finally, tired and satisfied, they stood on the table, They felt ce kamo cynepzepou,\n\nLet's go! - Biscuitko shouted solemnly - Just to get my scarf! Because if I catch a cold, I'm going to sneeze, and did I sneeze...\n\n-Yes, yes, I know, you will get sick!\n\nThe moose went for a scarf, and BiskBumko sat on the edge of the table. In this\n\nfor a moment something at the window stirred and a lithe shadow slid into the darkness. She wrapped herself quietly around Biscuits\n\n- What are you doing? - gently ponuma\n\nthe shadow.\n\n- Oh, that startled me! Who are you?\n\n- I'm a fox, don't you see? - she answered him and her muzzle\n\nslowly came into the light.\n\nThe fox was actually a window sealer made of woolen cloth. She stretched and in the light of the window appeared the long and toned figure in a shot\n\n- Ah, but here it smells of biskvimku! -\n\nexclaimed the Fox.\n\n- Yes! All the boxes are full of Christmas cookies. Now we will deliver the orders!!! Biscuitko proudly explained.\n\n- You smell delicious too!\n\n- Well, because I'm biskvumka.\n\n- And you're not in a box?\n\n- I am defective...\n\n- Oh, looking at you, I'm getting hungry! - the Fox approached Biscuits.\n\n- ...Because my buttons are crooked and my frosting has spread! That's why... - the little man continued to explain.\n\n\"I don't hear anything because I'm hungry,\" Lissa interrupted. - Please get on my tail so I can hear you better. Biscuit looked at her and thought, “Poor Fox! She does not\n\nlisten!\" and then said:\n\n- I don't get up to eat! Dont you see? - Oh, I can't see anything from hunger! Come a little closer!\n\nI'm defective and I'm not fit to eat!!! - cried Biscuitko. - Ayy, how can you talk like that?! - scolded the Fox. - You are one well-baked biscuit man! Well, you're a bit of a wimp!\n\n- Ah, no, I've already trained! I am very strong! - Wait until I take a good look at you!\n\n20\n\nshen voice:\n\nThe fox circled Cookie once more, measured his Height, then measured how far he could open his mouth. He grew stronger, and just as he was about to eat it, something rattled in the bakery, and from the dark shelves of spices, straw burned.\n\n21\n\nWoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! No one will eat Cookie! Who was that? - the Fox started.\n\nBuuuuhahahahaha! I am the Keeper of the Bakery! From the darkness of the shelves flew a large tin grater with two jar lids for eyes and two slotted spoons for wings, its beak a spoon and its legs made of forks. It looked quite like an owl. The owl spread its wings over the Fox's head and landed menacingly against her. He squeaked like a true knight, and after a kpamka struggle the Fox retreated into the darkness with nogßuma onawka.\n\n22.\nAt that moment the Moose appeared and called out\n\n-I'm ready! Let's go, BuckBunko\n\n-Boohoo, boohoo! Buchalt cleared his throat\n\n- Buk kak swelled up! Told me he falls asleep very quickly\n\nSuck8umko!\n\n- I'm not Biscuitko! I'm owling because I'm an owl!\n\n-A, koge e buckBumko?\n\n- Here I am! - popped out from behind the tower om kyuu Buckumko Thanks for saving me from the Fox! I'm Cookie, the brave man.\n\n-Yes-yes, I heard your whole song. I'm Buchhalt\n\n- We are going on an expedition! - boasted Cookie -Hue -I want to come with you too! - the Owl's eyes lit up.\n\n- It's cold and scary outside, it's important to know\n\nLost\n\n- Super-shouted Buhalt. - I really like it to be scary\n\n23\n\nCookie, Moose and Owl started loading the Christmas boxes onto the flour crate. It took them out of-\n\na time to arrange them firmly and safely, but soon they were\n\nready and set off on an expedition in the blizzard. - We're out! cried the terrified Moose, when they came out into the street.\n\n- Quieter! You'll wake everyone up! - screeched the Owl. This is our first adventure! - he looked around with admiration\n\nCookie. - Isn't it Exciting?\n\n\"Actually, it's not that cold and scary,\" muttered the Moose\n\n- Takaaaa, ga Bidim for where is the first dostabka..... As always at such moments, a song began to sound in the air...\n\nWe are on an expedition\n\nour goal is clear Every Christmas breakfast\n\nshe must be wonderful!\n\n24\n\nIn front of them appeared a large box with the holy translation pok riboti was covered with a thick layer of suque.

We're going to dig a tunnel and save cookies-me\n\n! - said the little man and began to row with his hands. - Stop now! cried the Owl. - The snow will make your hands soft!\n\n- How are we going to dig a tunnel then?! muttered Lossom.\n\nThe three friends sat under the street lamp and thought. Suddenly Cookie and the Owl looked at each other with a smile and ce\n\nturned to Losa:\n\n- You will dig the tunnel! - jumped the little man cheerfully. - My horns are perfect for this job! - added the Owl. -Ahh, the snow is very cold. I do not want!\n\n26\n- No, I'm not waiting, we have a mission! Biskvumko replied matter-of-factly. The elk gasped and stuck an antlered spoon into the prispa, and then with\n\n- First you have to break it with the fork, and then toast it with the popcorn) - corrected BickBumko.\n\nLossum glared at him and snorted angrily, but continued to row, Buchalt brightening so that Losst could row on- Into the snow pile, and Biskvumko nogchopping from foot to foot and encouraging the workers. They advanced slowly, but a very strong tunnel was obtained.\n\n- No, I'm not waiting, we have a mission! Biskvumko replied matter-of-factly.

They advanced slowly, but a very strong tunnel was obtained.\n\nDone! - shouted Biscuitko and rushed to the boxes. The friends took a stab at the load of cookies and started\n\nto take them to a safe place.\n\n- Hooray! Shipments are saved! - shouted Biscuitko.\n\n- How are we going to deliver a box to this house? asked Lossam.\n\nCookie and the Owl looked at each other and smiled... - Aaaah, no, this time it won't be me! - Losut hastened to add. - You took off with the box and dropped it in place. I will make you-\n\nI'm leaving. Buchalt grabbed the box and with a creaking sound rose above the precipice. A little left! Stop! Sooooo right! Stop! Now up!\n\nCareful! Now slow forward!\n\nof the\n\n28\n\nAt that moment the ribbon on the box was untied and pramka-\n\nshe stomped on top of the snow chamber.\n\n- Oh no! - Shouted the Moose. - I knew it, I knew it!\n\n- Take it easy! - answered Biscuitko. - Owl, pick me up! Buchalt lifted him above the snow and stood over the box. Biscuitko swayed and nudged her towards the entrance of the house. The parcel soooo slid down the slope of the precipice and stopped right at the threshold. The three heroes waved their hands and shouted:\n\n- Hooray!\n\n- Cookie Box Number One has been delivered! - noted the man in the list. - On to the next house!\n\nThe city quietly sleeps in the frosty night, we will add coziness for luxury. Cookies in a box from our warehouse next to your cup of hot chocolate.\n\nAs the melody died down, the Christmas troupe disappeared into the snow towards the next houses that awaited the magical treats.\n\nDuring this time, however, a silent shadow watched over everything from the bakery window. Yes, it was the Fox, who smoothly descended through the open door and followed them.\n\n30\nThe characters reached a large house with Christmas lights around the windows. In front of the big house was an even bigger puddle of ice. After a short discussion and several unsuccessful attempts to overcome the obstacle, the friends decided that Biscuitko should carry the box to the door, because only his feet did not stick to the ice. Well, of course, there were some funny Vania slips, somersaults and a penguin flight, but Biscuits successfully coped with this package too.\n\n- Shipment number two is in place! - Buchhalt was happy and marked this on the list.\n\nThe song kept playing and our heroes moved on. The fox ran after them and missed them\n\nfollowed.\n\n31\n\nWe are on an expedition, our goal is clear - Every Christmas breakfast should be wonderful!\n\nThe tower of boxes was shrinking, and the Christmas cookies were reaching their recipients. The heroes felt proud and happy about the accomplishment of the important task, despite the slight fatigue. They approached the next house, but could not omkpuam omkode to enter. As they circled her, the Moose's antlers rattled against the fence posts. When they finally found the door to the yard and opened it, a huge dog house appeared in front of them. The friends looked at each other for a moment and\n\nThey shouted in unison:\n\nEng\n\nThey slammed the gate, dropped the delivery in the mailbox outside the House, and hurried on.\n\nI don't understand why there are such huge and scary dogs in the yards?! muttered the Moose. Buhu, dogs aren't scary, they're just at work - no-\n\nexplained the Owl.\n\n- A dog?! - Biscuit was puzzled. - What a dog, there was only a dog house.\n\nWell, ga ge, what's a scary watchdog for you? - okonumu ce Lost. - You can just put a huge and scary dog house in the yard, and let us imagine the rest of the scary. That way we will be both afraid and safe.\n\nThe three of them giggled and continued down the snowy sidewalk. Come on friends! We have a few more boxes. Let's go\n\nto the next street! - shouted the biscuit cho-Veche enthusiastically and ticked off another delivery on the list.\n\n33\n\nEng\n\nThey slammed the gate, dropped the delivery in the mailbox outside the House, and hurried on.\n\nI don't understand why there are such huge and scary dogs in the yards?! muttered the Moose.

When the huge and scary Dog House stood before her, the Fox quickly closed the gate and ran after the Christmas characters. Hmmm, no need for a scary dog, the shack is enough.\n\nCookie, Moose, and Buckhalt had already covered the crate with Boxes in front of the next house. In this pre-Christmas snowstorm, the heroes managed to cope with a variety of challenges. They delivered cookies to the second floor with the help of a beke from space, Made a ball of Christmas lights 8 QUN 2800 Sneak between thorn bushes and jumped over white bars but no matter what happened, they managed to continue the expedition. The moose grew less and less afraid, Buhalt more and more squeaky, and Biscuitko jumped up and down in delight and sang his first song.\n\n34\nWe are on an expedition, our goal is clear - Every Christmas breakfast should be wonderful!\n\nci-\n\nwhat\n\nis\n\non\n\neg\n\nIt is\n\nThe fox watched as the three friends left a box of cookies in front of each house and growled softly. She was trying both to catch up with them and to remain unnoticed. She shot at every delivery on the doorstep, but someone always scooped up the treats right under her nose. The checkered stalker became angry and her tail suddenly electrified.\n\n35\nWe are on an expedition, our goal is clear - Every Christmas breakfast should be wonderful!\n\nThe fox watched as the three friends left a box of cookies in front of each house and growled softly.

And I eat it! - hissed the Fox and rushed to catch up with the expedition. During this time, our heroes had stopped to rest under the last street lamp of the city. will\n\n- Only one delivery left. It's for the house at the end of the forest - said Biscuitko and pointed in the dark in front of them. Ah, we didn't understand about any forest - the Moose stepped back.\n\n- We cannot miss even one house, no matter where it is! - replied the Owl.\n\nCookie nodded with a smile and sang:\n\n- Do you remember?! Our goal is clear! \"Every Christmas for-\n\nit must be wonderful!\" - But it's dark and foggy there. We might get lost. -\n\nThe moose was ready to come back. The owl looked at him with wide eyes:\n\n- Buhu, please, please, let's not be offended! If only I decide, and the dark will light up like an amusement park! - The Owl's eyes lit up and he turned his gaze towards the forest. - Let's go!\n\n36\n\nThe friends stepped into the deep snow and began to go around trees and bushes, and in the distance the windows of the last house shone. They were already quite tired and slowly dragged the crate on which the last box of Christmas biscuits was sitting.\n\n-I can not see! - Losm grumbled again. We're almost there! - shouted Biscuits, heading for the house.\n\n37\n\nThe friends stepped into the deep snow and began to go around trees and bushes, and in the distance the windows of the last house shone.

The biscuit cho- Already seems to have melted into the forest. The owl tried to shine in his nocoka, but finally lost sight of him. Then he huddled around the Moose and with joint efforts they managed to return the antlers to their place. Well, almost in his place. They began to walk slowly through the storm and call Biscuitko. Onumbaxa ce ga caught up with him, but the snowdrifts did not help them at all.\nAt that moment the Moose tripped in a clearing and one of his antlers fell off. The hero stood up with a groan\n\n- Onaaa... - whispered Biscuit.\n\n- What happened? Lossam was horrified.\n\n- Well, kak ga mu say... - began the Owl.\n\n- Did I get sick? - Losum got fed up.\n\n- Ah, no, no, you have nothing... And one of your horns is missing... - Here! I knew it! I knew it was dangerous in the forest! Oh, now\n\nI will faint!\n\nThe moose swayed and carefully laid down in the snow.\n\nWow!...\n\nWhat are we going to do? - Biscuitko hesitated for the first time. - I guess we should go back!\n\nNo way! - the Owl stopped him. - You take the last delivery and I'll handle the horned incident. We'll catch up with you! Good! I'm leaving!\n\n6\n\n38\nBiscuit sped forward into the blizzard. The trees bent and the wind whistled in their branches.

Onumbaxa ce ga caught up with him, but the snowdrifts did not help them at all.\n\n39\nBut the Fox had whistled and tossed him around like a tasty biscuit toy. And maybe when she opened her mouth wide and swallowed it, a terrible forest monster appeared from the forest with a roar and a crash. His body was made of leaves and branches, instead of a head he had a twisted nest with protruding feathers, his hands reached the ground and were made of pine bark, and his feet were made of giant pine cones, and with a creaking, they left two slow tracks in the snow. The monster furiously вύρου κ the Fox. A noisy struggle ensued. Lisha was throwing and writing, and the monster was bellowing loudly, sneezes fearfully, screamed horrifyingly. In the commotion that ensued, Biscuit managed to hide behind the crate, and the monster chased the Fox kow appena..\n\n\n- I said no one would eat Biscuit! - it roared and sneezed fearfully at the running Fox. Then he added: - Here, I knew\n\nBiscuit appeared from behind the crate and timidly ponuma:\n\n- Moose?\n\nI'm going to get sick now...\n\nThen the forest beast sneezed again and collapsed. Of course it was the Moose and the Owl! They rushed to Biskvumko.\n\n\"Are you okay?\" they called me in unison.\n\n- Friends, you were scary! We arrived just in time to make the last gocmaßka!\n\nThe heroes hugged each other and solemnly received the last Christmas gift.\n\nThey left the box in front of the door, rang the bell and hid behind a large snow bush. The door of the house opened and two hands came in. The \"Christmas Bisquimku\" expedition was successfully completed! The company got excited, shouted \"hooray!\", but very quietly, and the heroes set off tiredly to the bakery. On the way, exhausted but happy, they recalled different moments of their unforgettable adventure. They laughed, rolled around in the snow and ate an ice pod and a snow monka each so they wouldn't be sick anymore. They came out of the forest, passed through the quiet streets of the city and imperceptibly approached the cozy bakery. The door quietly ombopu u me sank into its warm home. The windows darkened and the characters fell asleep.\n\n43\n\nIn the morning, the snowstorm had passed, the sun was peeking through the window, and Ronya and Martin were getting ready for work. The new snowflakes were piled up on the street like glittering hills, the footsteps of passers-by crunched on the pavement, and shaggy rednecks hopped in the tracks and chirped happily.\n\n- It is very beautiful! Ronya sighed as she watched through the window.\n\nMartin looked thoughtfully at the bakery counter. The boxes of biskvumku were missing, and the list noted that all deliveries had been received.\n\n- All orders are from\n\nstuffed?! he murmured.\n\nDid you do it? and Ronia. popi- -\n\n- He!\n\nList\n\nhe is Lemon 20 y Tikva No. 35 y Eggplant No. 16 yn Tepema No 11 y Cassia No. 5 Aholac N 3\n\n44\n\nC\n\nMartin smiled and added with relief: - But I think I remember who did all the work At the table - tired but happy - snorted Cookie, the Moose and the Owl.

With Martin, they arranged a special place for them in the bakery, where even today you can zu Bu-\n\nyou breathe Yes, yes, right there, above the display case, where grandma's recipe is written down.\n\n45\nAnd the Fox?! The fox wandered through the forest, wet and hungry, but finally he reached the bakery and curled up in a ball at the door. Ronja and Martin took it away and left it warm in front of the oven to warm and dry, because it is made of plaid wool after all. Then they placed her by the window to stop the draft. Next to her they put a comfortable bench for guests. Every now and then someone would sit there to eat a cookie, om buckbumkama ce pocunbaxa sweet crumbs would fall on the Fox's nose.
