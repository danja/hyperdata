  "text": " Certainly, I'll provide a brief comparison of turndown and the alternatives based on your priorities:\n\n1. Turndown:\n   Pros:\n   - Very popular (over 1.5 million weekly downloads on npm)\n   - Actively maintained (last update within the last 6 months as of my knowledge cutoff)\n   - Highly extensible with a plugin system\n   - Good documentation\n   \n   Cons:\n   - Slightly larger bundle size compared to some alternatives\n\n2. html-to-markdown:\n   Pros:\n   - Lightweight\n   - Simple to use\n   \n   Cons:\n   - Less popular (about 30,000 weekly downloads)\n   - Less actively maintained\n   - Limited extensibility compared to turndown\n\n3. node-html-markdown:\n   Pros:\n   - Claims to be faster than turndown\n   - Actively maintained\n   - Growing in popularity (about 100,000 weekly downloads)\n   \n   Cons:\n   - Less extensive documentation\n   - Fewer options for customization compared to turndown\n\nGiven your priorities:\n\n1. Popularity: Turndown is the clear winner.\n2. Maintenance: Both turndown and node-html-markdown are well-maintained.\n3. Extensibility: Turndown offers the most options for customization and extension.\n\nBased on these factors, turndown seems to align best with your priorities. It's the most popular, well-maintained, and offers the most extensibility. However, if performance is a critical factor for your use case, you might want to benchmark turndown against node-html-markdown.",

  "text": " Yes, there are several Node.js libraries that can convert HTML to Markdown. One popular option is called \"turndown\". It's designed to do exactly what you're looking for - convert HTML to Markdown.\n\nHere's a brief overview of how you might use turndown:\n\n```javascript\nconst TurndownService = require('turndown')\n\nconst turndownService = new TurndownService()\nconst markdown = turndownService.turndown('<h1>Hello world!</h1>')\n\nconsole.log(markdown)\n// Output: # Hello world!\n```\n\nTurndown is highly customizable and allows you to define your own rules for conversion if needed.\n\nOther options include:\n\n1. html-to-markdown\n2. to-markdown (though this one is deprecated in favor of turndown)\n3. node-html-markdown\n\nWould you like more details on how to use any of these libraries, or information on their specific features?",
