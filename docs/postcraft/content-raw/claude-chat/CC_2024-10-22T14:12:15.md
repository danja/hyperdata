Introduction\nMetadata is usually defined as being data about data. What is proposed here is to apply exactly the same techniques to describe processes, moving away from data-centricity towards a more general resource-centricity. RDF Process Profile is an attempt to standardize the description of data processors, and allow their processes to be represented in the same fashion as any other (web) resource. RPP is intended as a lightweight layer based on RDF(S) which will allow simple description of a process, on top of which more sophisticated layers can be built. The processes may be available online, though RPP is intended to be appropriate for both online and offline resources. To achieve the maximum applicability of process description wherever possible the processes will be identified through reference to their algorithm(s), though in practice it is anticipated that for most processes the algorithms themselves will not be available, rather an implementation of the algorithm. The goal is to provide in a RPP document descriptions of all the resources required to carry out the data processing defined in that document. RPP definitions may be defined in terms of other RPP definitions, allowing multistage/multilayered process definition. Terms defined in other schema may be included to extend the functionality of a RPP document into other domains. The use of a standard metadata format (RDF/XML) should enable advertising and lookup/discovery of the processes described in RPP documents. It is hoped that the RPP format will provide a suitable base layer on top of which other facilities required by online services, for example process leasing, chain of trust and security management can be built.\n\nWhere a language like DAML allows data to be marked up for agent's consumption, RPP will describe the agents themselves so they may be fed the right stuff.\n\nIt is likely that existing vocabularies contain terms that could be used in place of those described here. It is believed that in terms of interoperability that it will be advantageous to encapsulate process-specific metadata in a single vocabulary, such as RPP. If considered appropriate links to other vocabularies may be added later in the form of properties such as daml:equivalentTo.\n\nAn alternate view of RPP would be that of enabling a meta query system. We have some data that needs processing or a requirement for data that is specified in metadata. We supply this to a system containing marshalling facilities and an inference engine, with access to RPP repositories. The inferencing required is little more than matching the conventional metadata with an algorithm described in RPP and then the data and algorithm could be marshalled to an appropriate processing host and the operation carried out. There may be data returned from the query but this need not always be the case - e.g. the state of an external system may be modified.\n\n4. Terminology\n4.1 Algorithm\nWithin this document this word is primarily used in the dictionary sense of a process or set of rules used for calculation or problem-solving, though the range of entities described by the term here extend from very abstract procedures e.g. 'draw a fish' through more canonically expressed forms such as C source code, also encompassing black box data processors.\n\nThe actual detail of the description of an algorithm is in many respects not significant, as long as there is enough information for an inference engine receiving a RPP document and a set of metadata to be able to decide (through reference to external resources as necessary) whether or not the algorithm described can be realized in a form that can carry out the required processing of the data the metadata describes.\n\n4.2 Process*\nThe entities being described by a RPP definition will be referred to as data processors or processes, with no direct relation to XML processors. Within this document the terms process and algorithm are used interchangeably, which is sloppy as in this context they may not refer to the same thing.\n\nInformal prose is suggestive. Formal specification non-lucrative...\n\n5. Vocabulary\nRPP follows the conventions for the RDF/XML syntax and model described in RDFMS. Additional elements are as follows :\n\nClasses\n\nResource\nProfile\nComponent\nAvailability\nDependency\nEnvironment\nLibrary\nAlgorithm\nInterface\nDataFormat\nEncoding\nProperties\n\ncomponent\nlocation\navailability\nin\nout\nalang\nhasDependency\nimplementationOf\nequivalentTo\n \n\nPretty picture from the wonderful RDFSViz :\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nHere's another view of the schema (even prettier picture!) from Protege using the OntoViz plugin (many thanks to Michael Sintek).\n\n// I'm not at all sure about the scoping - my general feeling was that it would be most useful for the attributes to have there values described by reference to external documents, though additional local (& literal?) support might be more appropriate.\n\n5.1 Classes\n5.1.1 rpp:Resource\nA wrapper around rdfs:Resource to localise references\n5.1.2 rpp:Profile\nThis resource - name and location (not necessarily the same as location property)\n\n5.1.3 rpp:Component\nContainer class for classes specifying profile attributes.\n5.1.4 rpp:Availability\nHow machine-friendly the algorithm resource is - one of definition, source, executable or process. If the resource may be used directly by sending and/or receiving data as described in the RPP definition, then the availability property will have the value process. If the resource may be used in conjunction with another single (rad:algorithm) resource such as an operating system runtime environment or interpreter then the availability property will have the value executable. If the resource needs more than one external (rad:algorithm) resource to be able to carry out the required data processing then the availability will be have the value source. If the algorithm is described in a form that isn't machine readable (though may be human-readable - using any form of notation such as the English language, diagrams etc) the availability will have the value definition.\n5.1.5 rpp:Dependency\nObjects without which the process cannot operate.\n\n5.1.6 rpp:Environment\nParticular kind of dependency - runtime environment needed by the executable algorithm, typically the operating system or virtual machine.\n5.1.7 rpp:Library\nParticular kind of dependency - typical example would be Java libraries that had to be on the classpath.\n5.1.8 rpp:Algorithm\nAn identifier for the algorithm of the process - may be name or reference to source code etc.\n\n5.1.9 rpp:Interface\nThis will describe the means by which data can pass to and/or from the data processor. For an online service this might for example be a HTTP POST. For offline resources this should give adequate description of the data processor's requirements so that an online data processor meeting these requirements (if one exists, and is known to the system) may be identified.\n5.1.10 rpp:DataFormat\nA description of a data format. Typically this will be the URI of a schema. The schema may be a DTD, XML Schema, human language description or other type.\n\n5.1.11 rpp:Encoding\nThe low-level encoding of the data to/from the processor\n\n5.2 Properties\n5.2.1 rpp:component\n \n\n5.2.2 rpp:location\nThe location of the process described by RPP (e.g. the URL to POST to for online processing or the URL pointing to an executable binary file).\n\n5.2.3 rpp:availability\n \n\n5.2.4 rpp:in\nDefines characteristics of the process in its role as a consumer of data. The domain and range of the data the algorithm consumes will be defined. A RPP definition of an algorithm can contain any number of input values, the only constraint being that there is sufficient description to fulfil the requirements of the rpp:availability property.\n\n5.2.5 rpp:out\nAs rpp:in, but defines characteristics of the algorithm in its role as a producer of data.\n\n5.2.6 rpp:alang\nApplicable when availability is source or definition. The language the algorithm is defined in, if known, one of C, C++, Perl, Python, Java, Pseudocode, UML etc. etc. This may refer to a URI as a unique identifier, or another RPP document defining the interpreter/compiler.\n\n5.2.7 rpp:hasDependency\nAnything required to carry out the process being described.\n\n5.2.8 rpp:implementationOf\nA pointer to a more abstract equivalent RPP.\n\n(definition isMoreAbstractThan source isMoreAbstractThan executable isMoreAbstractThan process)\n(isMoreAbstract needs defining? needs inverse?)\n\n5.2.9 rpp:equivalentTo\nAny other known versions of the algorithm expressed in RPP format. Typically this would be used to refer a request for processing on to a more appropriate processor.\n\n6.

Example\n// I know this is lousy - in terms of syntax & content (and I'm not even sure about the font), but I thought if I put this in at least it's a start - any flames I get should help the learning process ;-)\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n\n<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf = \"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"\nxmlns:rdfs = \"http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#\"\nxmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.0/\"\nxmlns = \"http://www.citnames.com/2001/04/rpp#\">\n\n<Profile rdf:about=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/cwm.py\">\n\n<dc:Title>Closed World Machine</dc:Title>\n<dc:Description>\nThis is an engine which knows a certian amount of stuff and can manipulate it.\nIt is a query engine, not an inference engine: that is, it will apply rules\nbut won't figure out which ones to apply to prove something.\n</dc:Description>\n<dc:Creator>TimBL</dc:Creator>\n\n<availability rdf:resource=\"#source\"/>\n<in rdf:resource=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/log.n3#\"/>\n<in rdf:resource=\"http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html\"/>\n<in rdf:resource=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"/>\n<implementationOf rdf:resource=\"http://www.agfa.com/w3c/euler/\"/>\n<location rdf:resource=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/cwm.py\"/>\n<hasDependency rdf:resource=\"UNIX\"/>\n<hasDependency rdf:resource=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/notation3.py\"/>\n<out rdf:resource=\"http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html\"/>\n<out rdf:resource=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"/>\n</Profile>\n\n</rdf:RDF>\n\n8. Notes\nThe general idea here seems reasonable to me - not distinguishing between the metadata of program and data just seems like updating von Neumann a bit.\n\nThe aim mustn't be confused with any kind of formal notations - this isn't about making rock-solid formalisms, just providing enough info to be able to use a process.\n\nDetractors may (hopefully) say that RPP is a gross oversimplification - the goal is to simplify down to the barest minimum needed to do the job.\n\nThe first few RPP documents will be the hardest - once a document has been built to describe e.g. Python, identifying this will be adequate for RPPs of processes that use Python (rdfs:isDefinedBy).\n\nIt'd be nice to have some clear indication of when the end result of a process is a graphical representation, but I couldn't think of a way without it seeming overly arbitrary.\n\nThe way CC/PP wraps up attributes in a 'Component' object appealed to this code junky - seems like a good sub-pattern of 'Profile'.\n\nGiven that the primary context for RPP is the web it has not been mentioned here that it would be desirable for it to be possible to create a RPP document for any given process - e.g. how an egg is boiled. This may be possible with RPP as defined in this document, however this hasn't been put to the test. Hopefully the next version of this specification will take this more into account.\n\n9. To Do\nNeed to an 'owner' property (for use with agents)\n\nNeed to a pointer to documentation - rpp:rtfm ?\n\nDTD for instances\n\nrun it by rdf-interest & xml-dev\n\nchange my name, buy a mask & leave the country (again!)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n© 2001 Danny Ayers All rights reserved.\n\nRDF\n\nstuff"

It aims to standardize how data processors are described, moving away from data-centric approaches toward resource-centric ones. RPP allows both online and offline processes to be represented as web resources, with descriptions of all required resources needed to carry out data processing. The specification includes a vocabulary of classes (like Profile, Component, Algorithm) and properties (like location, availability, input/output) that can be used to describe processes.
