  "text": " The Toki Pona phrase \"pali wan, kama pini tu.\" can be translated to English as:\n\n\"Do one task, finish two.\"\n\nThis phrase uses the following Toki Pona words:\n- pali: work, do, make\n- wan: one\n- kama: to become, to arrive, to bring about\n- pini: end, finish, complete\n- tu: two\n\nThe meaning conveys the idea of efficiency or accomplishing more than expected - by doing one task, you end up completing two things. It's similar to the English saying \"killing two birds with one stone.\"",
