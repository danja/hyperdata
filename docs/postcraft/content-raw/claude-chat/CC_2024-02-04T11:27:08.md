This reveals a great opportunity to\nexploit renewable energy resources in buildings to achieve the\nclimate target. In this context, this paper offers a building’s energy\nsystem embracing a heat pump, a thermal energy storage system\nalong with grid-connected photovoltaic thermal (PVT) collectors\nto supply both electric and thermal energy demands of the\nbuilding with minimum operating cost. To this end, the paper\ndevelops a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) strategy to\noptimally determine the set-point of the whole building’s energy\nsystem while accounting for the uncertainties associated with the\nPVT energy generation. This system enables the building to 1-shift\nits electric demand from high-peak to off-peak hours and 2- sell\nelectricity to the grid to make energy arbitrage.\nIndex Terms— Stochastic Model predictive control (MPC),\nbuilding energy management systems (BEMSs), renewable energy\nresources (RES), thermal energy storage system (TESS), Mixed-\ninteger linear stochastic optimization.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nuilding sector plays an important role in the global\nwarming and clime change. This sector is responsible for\naround 40% of the global energy consumption, and\naccordingly, 40% of energy-related global CO2 emissions\n[1,2,3]. To meet climate goals, it is of paramount importance to\nmodernize building energy management systems (BEMSs) and\nintegrate renewable energy resources (RES) in this sector with\nthe purpose of supplying both thermal and electric demands of\nbuildings [4]. In this respect, new policies like the Directive on\nEnergy Performance of Buildings have set themselves the goal\nof reaching fully decarbonized building sector by 2050 [5,6].\nHowever, these new policies cannot be realized without novel\nBEMSs. For example, all promoting incentives and policies for\nincreasing the penetration rate of RES in building sector have\nnot been significantly effective and currently less than 15% of\nthe total energy demand of buildings is provided by RES\ninstalled in them [7]. To quantify the compliance of the\nbuildings with the fully decarbonized target, an index called\nbuilding’s self-consumption [8,9], or more specifically self-\nconsumption of RES in the building, can be defined with value\nbetween 0 and 1. This index indicates the proportion of the\nbuilding’s total energy demand (including both thermal and\nelectric demand) over a selected time horizon that is supplied\nHossein Kalantar-Neyestanaki is with Niroo Research Institute (NRI), Tehran,\nIran (hosein.kalantar@gmail.com).\nby the RES installed in the building. The main obstacles in the\nway of reaching fully decarbonized buildings (i.e. buildings\nwith self-consumption equal to 1) are that:\n• RES’s generated energy is fully dependent on the\nmeteorological conditions and does not follow the\nbuilding’s energy demand. More specifically, there is a time\nmismatch between supply and demand of energy. Above all,\nRES’s generated energy might be accompanied by spikes.\n• The demand of buildings is volatile and accompanied with\nspikes (of demand). These spikes of demand might cause\ncongestion in the electric network during peak hours.\nTherefore, shifting demand (i.e. moving the consumption\nfrom peak to off-peak hours) and removing spikes of\ndemand are vital to keep the security of the electricity\nsupply.\nTo deal with this issue, the capability of thermal energy\nstorage systems (TESSs) for storing energy can be leveraged to\n1-store energy when there is a surplus of RES’s energy\ngeneration and 2- deliver energy when there is a shortage of\nRES’s energy generation. On the other hand, the TESSs can\nhelp to accomplish demand-shifting, i.e. shifting energy\nconsumption from peak to off-peak hours in buildings [10],\n[11].\nThe existing literature have broadly used a building energy\nsystem architecture consisting of a TESS along with RES to\nimprove the self-consumption of buildings, thereby, facilitate\nthe transition of the building sector towards a decarbonized\nsector. In this emerging field, the fundamental question that\nnaturally arises is that:\nHow should be the building’s energy system managed to\nfacilitate the integration of RES in the building with the purpose\nof supplying both thermal and electric demands of the building\nwhile minimizing the building’s energy cost and preserving the\nthermal comfort of the residents?\nThe ASHRAE handbook [12,13] provides a comprehensive\nsurvey about the control techniques used in BEMSs. It\nhighlights that classical control techniques have been widely\nused in BEMS owing to their simplicity in design and low\ncomputational complexity. The heating, ventilation and air\nconditioning (HVAC) systems are traditionally controlled using\na classical control method called Rule-Based Controllers\nMadjid Soltani is with Mechanical Engineering Department of K.N.Toosi\nUniversity of Technology, Tehran, Iran (msoltani@kntu.ac.ir).\nUncertainty-Cognizant Model Predictive Control\nfor Energy Management of Residential Buildings\nwith PVT and Thermal Energy Storage\nHossein Kalantar-Neyestanaki, Madjid Soltani\nB\n\n2\n(RBC). RBC divides the whole building into several parts and\naccordingly manages each part separately. The simplest RBC is\nOn/Off switches installed in each room of the old buildings to\ncontrol the heating and cooling system of the room. To achieve\na more efficient heating and cooling system, modern buildings\nrely on Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control loops to\ncontrol variable frequency drives. Although highly\nsophisticated classical controllers might provide a good\nperformance in room-level applications, they are never able to\nsupport building-level applications like optimizing the whole\nenergy consumption of the building [14].\nAfram et al. [15] classified HVAC control techniques into\nseveral main categories: 1-classical control, 2- soft control, 3-\nhard control, and 4-other minor control techniques. Among all\nmentioned control techniques, model predictive control (MPC),\nbelonging to the hard control category, is a well-established\nmethod that has been greatly receiving researchers’ attention.\nIn contrast with the classical control techniques, MPC provides\na holistic perception about the whole building over a selected\ntime horizon. More specifically, MPC exploits the existing\npowerful prediction approaches to predict unknown parameters\n(such as outdoor temperature, energy demand of the building,\nenergy generation of the RES installed in the building) of the\nsystem over the selected time horizon. Then, MPC determines\nthe optimal control actions by solving an optimization problem\nwhose constrains model technical restrictions of the building’s\nenergy system over the whole time horizon [16]. On the other\nhand, the existing agile commercial optimization solvers like\nGurobi and CPLEX along with advanced monitoring systems\ninstalled in the modern buildings make the MPC as a practical\napproach to optimally steer the energy system of the modern\nbuildings embracing RES, TESS and HVAC [14]. The existing\nliterature have mainly employed MPC to either 1- optimally\ncontrol a single HVAC system (e.g. TESS, ground-source heat\npump, window control, etc.) or 2- implement demand response\n(DR) in the buildings. DR refers to managing the building\nenergy consumption in order to alleviate congestion in the\nelectric power grid, such as reducing or shifting consumption at\npeak hours.\nHalvgaard et al. [17] applied an MPC scheme to optimally\noperate an electric heating element coupled with a TESS while\ncovering the mismatch between the generated thermal energy\nof the solar collector and the thermal demand of the building.\nThis work experimentally represented that its developed MPC\nstrategy can achieve 25-30 % annual energy cost saving in\ncomparison with the thermostat control strategy. Deng et al.\n[18] constructed an MPC strategy to derive the optimal set-\npoints of a central chiller plant paired with TESS. It relied on a\nheuristic algorithm to solve the MPC problem. Its presented\nresults revealed that the MPC scheme is able to significantly\ndecrease the electricity cost, i.e. 10.84% electricity cost saving.\nD’Ettorre et al. [19] investigated the potential cost saving that\ncan be achieved by installing a TESS in a hybrid thermal system\ncomposed of a heat pump and a gas boiler. This work adopted\nan MPC scheme to find the optimum size of the TESS and\noptimally control the hybrid system. Its obtained results\nillustrated energy cost saving up to 8% compared to the case\nwithout TESS. Carvalho et al. [20] considered a ground source\nheat pump (GSHP) to provide the thermal demand of a building\nwhile minimizing the electricity cost. To this end, it leveraged\nthe thermal storage capacity of the building and offered a load\nshifting strategy where the GSHP consumes electricity in off-\npeak hours and pre-heat the building. In this way, it shifts the\nelectric demand of the building and accordingly minimizes the\nbuilding’s electricity cost. Finally, its presented results showed\n34% reduction in the building’s electricity cost. Arteconi et al.\n[10] considered a building energy system comprised of a TESS\nand a heat pump with either radiators or underfloor heating\nsystem. It showed that the stored energy of the TESS can be\nutilized to preserve the building’s thermal comfort even if the\nheat pump is turned off for 3 hours during peak hours. This\nwork taped this unique capability of TESS (i.e. storing energy)\nto flatten the shape of the building’s electricity demand curve\nby switching off the heat pump during peak hours, thereby,\nreducing electricity cost considering the time-of-use (TOU)\ntariff. Baniasadi et al. [21] considered a building equipped with\ntwo TESSs and a water storage tank (WST). To empower this\nbuilding to provide DR service to the electric grid, this work\nfirstly defined a dynamic temperature set-point on the basis of\nthe real-time electricity price, thereby, enhancing peak-load\nshifting of demand. Then, it developed an MPC to optimally\ndetermine the thermal energy that the GSHP should provide to\nthe WST to minimize the operation cost of the entire energy\nsystem and maintain the indoor temperature within a desirable\ncomfort range. Touretzky et al. [22] proposed an economic\nMPC in the context of buildings equipped with a TESS, in\nwhich the building HVAC system was controlled with the aim\nof minimizing the purchased electricity cost while considering\nTOU pricing. Shah et al. [23] presented an approach to\ninvestigate the effectiveness of using TESS in reducing the cost\nof providing hot water for a residential building for 24 hours\nwhile considering TOU pricing.\nIn sum, there are numerous researches related to the\napplication of MPC in building. All these works highlight the\nimportance of accurate modeling of the building energy system,\nabove all they bear testimony to the capability of MPC for\nachieving significant amount of financial/energy saving\nwithout compromising the comfort level of residents\n[24,25,26]. Although a variety of approaches have been\ndeveloped to manage the building’s energy system, the existing\nliterature however lacks a framework to treat the question put\nforward earlier. In this context, the main contributions of the\npaper can be enumerated as follows:\n• Offering linear models for all elements of the building\nenergy system, most notably the building and TESS.\nThese linear models are leveraged to offer a\ncomputationally affordable MPC strategy.\n• Exploiting a PVT-air dual source heat pump to recover\nenergy from both solar irradiation and ambient air,\nthereby improving the performance of the heat pump\nunder a wide range of operating conditions.\n• Introducing a machine learning-based approach to\nexploit the existing historical data, thereby, predicting\nthe RES generation (solar irradiation) and outdoor\nambient air temperature over the selected tine horizon.\n\n3\nPVT\n \nDual Source\nHeat Pump (HP)\nThermal Energy\nStorage System\n(TESS)\nBuilding\n𝑃\n𝑒\n,\n𝐺𝑟𝑖𝑑\n𝑃\n𝑒\n,\n𝐵𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔\n𝑃\n𝑒\n,\n𝑃𝑉𝑇\n𝑃\n𝑡ℎ\n,\n𝑃𝑉𝑇\n𝑃\n𝑡ℎ\n,\n𝐻𝑃\n𝑃\n𝑒\n,\n𝐻𝑃\n𝑃\n𝑡ℎ\n,\n𝐵𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔\nAir Source\nEvaporator\n𝑃\n𝑡ℎ\n,\n𝑎𝑖𝑟\nFig. 1 Energy flow between the main components of the Building’s energy\nsystem.\nMoreover, this approach is able to model the\nuncertainties associated with RES generation (solar\nirradiation) through a number of scenarios.\n• Constructing a stochastic MPC strategy to maximize the\nbuilding’s self-consumption while accounting for the\nuncertainties associated with RES.

SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND MODELLING\nA. System Architecture\nThis paper considers an energy system formed of 3 main\ncomponents, namely a thermal energy storage system (TESS),\na PVT-air dual source heat pump and a photovoltaic thermal\n(PVT) collector, to supply both thermal and electric demands\nof a building. The schematic block diagram of this energy\nsystem is shown in Fig. 1. As it can be seen, the absorbed\nelectricity from the grid (𝑃\n𝑒,𝐺𝑟𝑖𝑑\n) along with the generated\nelectricity of the PVT collector (𝑃\n𝑒,𝑃𝑉𝑇\n) are leveraged to satisfy\nboth the electric demand of the building (𝑃\n𝑒,𝐵𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔\n) and the\nelectric power consumption of the heat pump (𝑃\n𝑒,𝐻𝑃\n). More\nspecifically, the heat pump consumes electric power (𝑃\n𝑒,𝐻𝑃\n) to\ntackle two fundamental tasks:\n• The absorbed thermal energy from the PVT evaporator\n(𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝑃𝑉𝑇\n) doesn’t have an appropriate temperature level to be\ndirectly delivered to the TESS. To overcome this issue, the\nheat pump receives the thermal energy of the evaporators and\nconsumes electric power (𝑃\n𝑒,𝐻𝑃\n), thereby providing thermal\nenergy (𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝐻𝑃\n) with temperature level that can be delivered\nto the TESS.\n• During periods (like nights) where the PVT cannot generate\nany thermal energy, the heat pump uses air source evaporator\nHP\nPVT\nEVP\n \nCond\nComp\nBuilding\nFan Coil\nUnit\nTES\n𝑇\n𝑜𝑢𝑡\n𝑃𝑉𝑇\n𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑃𝑉𝑇\n𝑇\n𝑜𝑢𝑡\n𝐻𝑃\n,\n𝑒𝑣𝑝\n𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝐻𝑃\n,\n𝑒𝑣𝑝\n𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝐻𝑃\n,\n𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑\n𝑇\n𝑜𝑢𝑡\n𝐻𝑃\n,\n𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑\nPump 1\n \nPump 2\n𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑇𝐸𝑆\n𝑇\n𝑜𝑢𝑡\n𝑇𝐸𝑆\n𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝐹𝐶𝑈\n𝑇\n𝑜𝑢𝑡\n𝐹𝐶𝑈\nPump 3\nAir\nSource\nEVP\nFig. 2 Detailed model of the building's energy system.\nand consumes electric power (𝑃\n𝑒,𝐻𝑃\n) to supply the required\nthermal demand of the TESS i.e. 𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝐻𝑃\n.\nThe TESS has a paramount role to constantly keep a balance\nbetween the supply and demand of the thermal energy in the\nbuilding, thereby preserving the thermal comfort of the\nresidents. More specifically, the TESS discharges (and\nrespectively charges) its stored thermal energy when the\nthermal demand of the building, i.e. 𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝐵𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔 \nis larger (and\nrespectively smaller) than the thermal power delivered by the\nheat pump, i.e. 𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝐻𝑃\n.\nIt is worth highlighting that this paper takes into account the\ntemporal variations of the electricity price over the selected\ntime horizon. Therefore, the best strategy to significantly\ndecrease the operation cost of the building’s energy system is\nto shift the electricity consumption of the system (𝑃\n𝑒,𝐺𝑟𝑖𝑑\n) from\nperiods with high prices to periods with low prices, i.e. from\npeak to off-peak periods. This strategy can be achieved thanks\nto the TESS:\n• During periods with low prices: the heat pump stores\nthermal energy in the TESS, i.e. the thermal energy that heat\npump delivers to the TESS (𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝐻𝑃\n) is larger than the thermal\ndemand of the building (𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝐵𝑢𝑖𝑙𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔\n).\n• During periods with high prices: the TESS discharges its\nstored thermal energy; therefore, the heat pump can consume\nless electricity and even stop working.\nIn other words, the TESS allows the heat pump to mainly\noperate in periods where the price of the electricity is low.\nTherefore, the TESS helps to minimize the operation cost of the\nsystem, i.e. the cost associated with purchasing electricity from\nthe grid (𝑃\n𝑒,𝐺𝑟𝑖𝑑\n), over the whole defined time horizon. The\ndetailed model of the building’s energy system is illustrated in\nFig. 2Fig. 2. The following sub-sections elaborate on the\nmodeling of each part of the building’s energy system.\nB. The Building’s Thermal Model\nThe BEMS, presented in this paper, leverages the building’s\nthermal model to determine the evolution of the building’s\nindoor air temperature over the time, thereby, ensuring the\nthermal comfort of the residents while optimally steering the\nbuilding’s energy system. In this respect, this sub-section sets\nout to derive the thermal model of a typical building in time\ndomain. The main thermal interactions affecting on the\nbuilding’s indoor air temperature, shown in Fig. 3, are:\n• heat input from solar radiation;\n• heating or cooling loads from fan coil;\n• heat transfer through the walls and windows;\n• internal heat gain corresponding to the activities of occupants\nsuch as metabolic heat, utilization of electrical devices, and\nthermal emission of artificial lighting.\nThis paper considers all elements located inside the building\nas a part of the building’s internal thermal mass which is shown\nas a part of the floor in Fig. 3. Therefore, the building’s indoor\nspace can be considered as two different thermal zones, i.e. the\n\n4\nSun\nHeat transfer\nbetween indoor and\noutdoor\nHeating or cooling load\nfrom fan coil\nHeat transfer between\nindoor air and building\nmaterials\nWindows\nBuilding\n \ns Internal Thermal Mass\nFig. 3 The simplified schematic of different thermal loads in a building’s zone.\nair and the building’s internal thermal mass. Then, the\nequivalent thermal-electrical model of the building is extracted\nas shown in Fig. 4. The privileged features of this model are:\n1-this model simply reflects the key thermal characteristics of\nthe building without increasing the complexity of the model,\nthereby, having low computational burden;\n2-this model can predict the system behavior under different\nconditions;\n3- this model is applicable for both short-term and long-term\nstudies where the variations of the building’s indoor air\ntemperature under dynamic situations are investigated.\nThe main components of the building’s thermal network and\nheat fluxes are shown in Fig. 4. This thermal network consists\nof 4 parts that are 1-outdoor environment, 2-building envelope\n(i.e. walls and windows), 3-indoor air, and 4-building’s internal\nthermal mass. In this model, each node is described by its\ntemperature (T) and its thermal capacity (C). Additionally, the\nheat transfer between two nodes are modeled by thermal\nresistances (R) [27].\nThe heat transfer on the external wall arises from the\nconvective heat transfer with the outdoor ambient air, not to\nmention radiative heat transfer with the sky (𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟,𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙\n). The\nsolar radiation enters the building through the windows and its\naccompanied energy is transmitted to the indoor air (𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟,𝑖\n)\nand the building’s internal thermal mass (𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟,𝑖𝑡𝑚\n). The\nbuilding’s internal thermal mass is modeled by a thermal\nresistance (𝑅\n𝑖\n) and a thermal capacitance (𝐶\n𝑖𝑡𝑚\n). The building’s\nindoor air absorbs:\n1-some portion of the solar radiation entered the building\nthrough the windows (𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟,𝑖\n);\n2-thermal loads of the equipment and occupants (𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑙\n);\n3-thermal load of the fan coil (𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝐹𝐶𝑈\n).\nThe abovementioned thermal loads are transmitted to the\nbuilding’s internal thermal mass through thermal resistance 𝑅\n𝑖\nand accordingly stored in it. This stored thermal energy is\ngradually released to the building’s indoor air in the next time\nintervals. Relying on the presented thermal-electrical model,\nthe thermal dynamics of the building can be mathematically\nmodeled as follows:\nThe energy balance for the exterior wall surface:\n𝐶\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑒𝑥\n𝑑𝑇\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑒𝑥\n𝑑𝑡 \n= \n𝑇\n𝑎𝑚𝑏 \n− 𝑇\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑒𝑥\n𝑅\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑒𝑥\n− \n𝑇\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑒𝑥 \n− 𝑇\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑖𝑛\n𝑅\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙\n+ 𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟,𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙 \n(1)\nThe energy balance for the interior wall surface:\n𝐶\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑖𝑛\n𝑑𝑇\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑖𝑛\n𝑑𝑡 \n= \n𝑇\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑒𝑥 \n− 𝑇\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑖𝑛\n𝑅\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙\n− \n𝑇\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑖𝑛 \n− 𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑅\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑖𝑛\n(2)\nOutdoor\nambient\nair\nWalls and\nWindows\nIndoor\nair\nBuilding\n \ns\ninternal thermal\nmass\n𝑇\n𝑎𝑚𝑏\n𝑇\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙\n \n,\n𝑒𝑥\n𝑇\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙\n \n,\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑇\n𝑖\n𝑡𝑚\n𝐶\n𝑖\n𝑡𝑚\n𝑅\n𝑖\n𝐶\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑅\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙\n \n,\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑅\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙\n𝑅\n𝑤\n𝑖𝑛\n𝐶\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙\n \n,\n𝑒𝑥\n𝐶\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙\n \n,\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑃\n𝑡ℎ\n,\n𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟\n \n,\n𝑤𝑎 𝑙𝑙\n𝑃\n𝑡ℎ\n,\n𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟\n \n,\n𝑖\n𝑃\n𝑡ℎ\n,\n𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑙\n𝑃\n𝑡ℎ\n,\n𝐹𝐶𝑈\n𝑅\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙\n \n,\n𝑒𝑥\n𝑃\n𝑡ℎ\n,\n𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟\n \n,\n𝑖𝑡𝑚\nFig. 4 Schematic of a building’s thermal network.\nThe energy balance for the indoor air:\n𝐶\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑑𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑑𝑡 \n= \n𝑇\n𝑎𝑚𝑏 \n− 𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑅\n𝑤𝑖𝑛\n+ \n𝑇\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑖𝑛 \n− 𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑅\n𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙,𝑖𝑛\n+ \n𝑇\n𝑖𝑡𝑚 \n− 𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑅\n𝑖\n+ 𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑙 \n+ 𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝐹𝐶𝑈\n+ 𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟,𝑖 \n(3)\nThe energy balance for the internal thermal mass:\n𝐶\n𝑖𝑡𝑚\n𝑑𝑇\n𝑖𝑡𝑚\n𝑑𝑡 \n= \n𝑇\n𝑖𝑛 \n− 𝑇\n𝑖𝑡𝑚\n𝑅\n𝑖\n+ 𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟,𝑖𝑡𝑚 \n(4)\nIn expressions (1) to (4), parameters C and R respectively\nrepresent the thermal capacitance and thermal resistance of the\nrespective parts, which depend on the building construction.\n𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟,𝑤𝑎𝑙𝑙 \nindicates the solar thermal power absorbed by the\nexternal wall surfaces.

In this context, this sub-section first\npresents the thermal and then the electrical model of the PVT\ncollector.\nThermal model of the PVT collector\nThe equivalent thermal-electrical model of the PVT collector\ncan be derived by considering 1-PV cell and 2-solar thermal\ncollector as nodes of the model. As shown in Fig. 6, the PVT\ncollector is modeled as a two-node thermal network whose two\nnodes are connected together via the internal thermal resistance\nof the PVT collector (𝑅\n𝑃𝑉𝑇\n). An effective thermal heat capacity\n(𝐶\n𝑒𝑓𝑓\n) connected to the solar thermal collector node (𝑇\n𝑚\n) is\nconsidered to model thermal capacities of cooling fluid,\nabsorber, PVT structure and frame, and insulations all together\n[31].

The Heat Pump model\nHeat pump (HP) is a key element of the building’s energy\nsystem. This element is used to provide heating and cooling in\nthe building. HP consumes electric power to transfer thermal\nenergy from a source with a lower temperature to a sink with a\nhigher temperature, accordingly HP can be operated in cooling\nor heating modes based on the required thermal load of the\nbuilding. To enable the HP to maintain efficient operation under\ndiverse environment conditions, a PVT-air dual source heat\npump is used as shown in Fig. 8. This HP consists of a PVT\nevaporator and an air source evaporator connected in parallel\nthat operate simultaneously to recover thermal energy from\nboth solar energy and ambient air. In cases where the\n\n8\nevaporating capacity in PVT evaporator remains relatively low\nunder low solar irradiation, the air source evaporator can make\namends for recovering heat. In literatures, there was rarely\nreported about dual source HP with double evaporators that\nencompasses air and solar source evaporators simultaneously\n[40,41].

STOCHASTIC MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL (MPC)\nSTRATEGY\nA. Stochastic MPC framework and structure\nThis section constructs a stochastic MPC strategy to\noptimally steer the building’s energy system over each\nindividual day. More specifically, the MPC strategy starts at the\nbeginning of the day and lasts until the end of the day, as\nillustrated in Fig. 9. Accordingly, the time horizon of the MPC\nproblem (H) is 24 hours of the day which embraces two time\nperiods:\n• Time slot (T): The whole 24-hour of the day is split into 48\ntime slots with duration T = 30 minutes and k =1, 2, …, 48\nindicates the rolling index for time slots over the day of\n1 \nConsidering the timeline of the problem depicted in Fig. 9, 𝜅 = 30𝑘.\nTime Slot 1\nTime\nTime Horizon: H = 24 hours\n0\nTime slot t\nT\n𝑡\n \nT\nH\nTime Slot 2\nAt the beginning of each time\n \nslot\n \n(\n𝑇\n),\n \nthe\n \nstochastic MPC strategy\n \n(\ndefined\ni\nn section III) is solved\n.

The MPC problem is solved at the beginning of\neach time slot, whereby, the operating set-point of the\nbuilding’s energy system is updated and actuated.\n• Sub-slot (𝜏): Each time slot consists of a number of sub-slots\nwith duration of 𝜏 = 1 minute and 𝜅 = 1, 2, …., 1440\nindicates the rolling index for sub-slots over the day of\noperation. The MPC problem models the trajectory of solar\nirradiation (𝐺) with time resolution of 𝜏 = 1 minutes to better\ncapture the high frequency temporal variations of the solar\nirradiation. However, the outdoor ambient air temperature\n(𝑇\n𝑎𝑚𝑏\n) and electricity price (𝜋\n𝑒,𝐺𝑟𝑖𝑑\n) have moderate temporal\nvariations, thus, their temporal variations are modeled with\ntime resolution of T = 30 minutes.\nThe outline of the MPC strategy can be elaborated\nconsidering the situations at the beginning of time slot k:\n1) The most recent realized outdoor ambient air\ntemperature (𝑇\n𝑎𝑚𝑏\n[k−1]), building’s indoor air\ntemperature (𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n[k−1]) and solar irradiation (𝐺[𝜅 − 1])\nare measured.\n2) the outdoor ambient air temperature (𝑇\n𝑎𝑚𝑏\n[k],\n𝑇\n𝑎𝑚𝑏\n[k+1], …, 𝑇\n𝑎𝑚𝑏\n[48]) and electricity price\n(𝜋\n𝑒,𝐺𝑟𝑖𝑑\n[k], 𝜋\n𝑒,𝐺𝑟𝑖𝑑\n[k+1], …, 𝜋\n𝑒,𝐺𝑟𝑖𝑑\n[48]) over upcoming\ntime slots (k, k +1,…, 48) are predicated with time\nresolution of T = 30 minutes.\n3) the solar irradiation (𝐺[𝜅], 𝐺[𝜅 + 1], …, 𝐺[1440]) over\nupcoming sub-slots (𝜅, 𝜅 + 1, …, 1440) is predicted\nwith time resolution of 𝜏 = 1 minute\n1\n. Moreover, the\nprediction error of the solar irradiation (Δ𝐺[𝜅, 𝑠],\nΔ𝐺[𝜅 + 1, 𝑠], …, Δ𝐺[1440, 𝑠]) is modeled through N\n𝑠\nscenarios with time resolution of 𝜏 = 1 minute. It should\nbe noted that 𝑠 =1, 2, …, N\n𝑠 \nindicates the index of\nscenarios modeling predication error of solar irradiation\n4) Value of all parameters and variables over each sub-slot\ncan be retrieved from its value over the associated time\nslot (for all 𝜅 = 30𝑘, 30𝑘 + 1, . . . ,30𝑘 + 29):\n𝜋\n𝑒,𝐺𝑟𝑖𝑑\n[\n𝜅\n] \n= 𝜋\n𝑒,𝐺𝑟𝑖𝑑\n[\n𝑘\n] \n(45)\n𝑇\n𝑎𝑚𝑏\n[𝜅] = 𝑇\n𝑎𝑚𝑏\n[k] (46)\n5) The MPC strategy is actuated with time resolution of T\n= 30 minutes. To put it simply, at the beginning of time\nslot k, the MPC problem is solved considering all\nupcoming time slots (k, k +1,…, 48) and accordingly the\noperating set-point of the HP and fan coils are\ndetermined over all the upcoming time slots. Then, the\noperating set-point of the HP and fan coils are\nupdated/actuated for the first upcoming time slot.

General framework of the MPC optimization problem applied to a\nbuilding and HVAC system.\nshould be noted that the building’s energy system (i.e.\nHP and fan coils) can only take a unique operating set-\npoint over each time slot (T = 30 minutes).\nB. Formulation of the Stochastic MPC Strategy\nThe goal of the MPC strategy is to determine the optimal set-\npoints of the HP and fan coil unit while minimizing the\noperation cost of the building’s energy system over the whole\nupcoming time slots. The MPC strategy takes into account:\n• the technical constraints of all elements of the building’s\nenergy system including PVT collector, HP and TESS.\n• thermal comfort of the residents.\n• temporal variations of the electricity price (𝜋\n𝑒,𝐺𝑟𝑖𝑑\n) and\noutdoor ambient air temperature (𝑇\n𝑎𝑚𝑏\n) over all upcoming\ntime slots.\n• Temporal variation of the solar irradiation (𝐺) and its\naccompanied forecast error (Δ𝐺) over all upcoming time slots.\nAs shown in Fig. 10, the MPC problem is a holistic control\napproach comprising of different building blocks namely: the\nsystem dynamic model, objective function and constraints with\na predefined time resolution and time horizon.\nTo mathematically formulate the MPC strategy, let’s assume\nto be at the beginning of the time slot k.\n1)Objective of the MPC Strategy\nThe control objective is to minimize the operation cost of the\nbuilding’s energy system over the whole upcoming time slots\n(k, k +1,…, 48) and accordingly over the whole upcoming sub-\nslots (𝜅, 𝜅 + 1, …, 1440). This control objective can be\nformulated as:\n𝑚𝑖𝑛 ∑ ∑ 𝜋\n𝑒,𝐺𝑟𝑖𝑑\n[𝜅]. 𝑃\n𝑒,𝐺𝑟𝑖𝑑\n[𝜅, 𝑠]\n𝑠∈𝕊𝜅∈𝕂\n(47)\nwhere 𝕂 = {𝜅, 𝜅 + 1, … , 1440} is the set of upcoming sub-\nslots, 𝕊 = {1, 2, . . . , N\n𝑠\n} is the set of scenarios modeling the\nforecast error of solar irradiation, 𝑃\n𝑒,𝐺𝑟𝑖𝑑\n[𝜅, 𝑠] is the amount of\nelectricity absorbed from the grid over the 𝜅\n𝑡ℎ \nsub-slot and\nscenario s. 𝜋\n𝑒,𝐺𝑟𝑖𝑑\n[𝜅] is the price of electricity over the 𝜅\n𝑡ℎ \nsub-\nslot. To put it another way, the MPC controller tries to switch\nthe HP and fan coil on or off to shift the electric power\nconsumption from peak to off-peak time slots, thereby,\nminimizing the purchased electricity cost form the grid.\n2)Constraints of the MPC strategy\nThe technical constraints of the TESS can be expressed\nas\nGrid\nelectricity\nprice\nWeather\nconditions\n(ambient\ntemperature\nand solar\nirradiance)\nMPC\nController\nParameters\npredicted for a\ngiven horizon\nAmount of electric energy purchased\nfrom the grid\nAmount of electric energy provided\nby the PVT\nOptimized System Response\nAmount of thermal load delivered\nfrom the HP to the TESS\nAmount of thermal load delivered\nfrom the TESS to the building\nElectrical management\nThermal management\nBuilding indoor temperature\nDecisions\nTurning on or off the HP and fan coil\nBuilding\nthermal and\nelectric\nloads\nFig. 11.

The MPC controller should predict and\noptimize energy utilization and operating costs, subject to\nchanges in electricity prices, building thermal and electric\nloads, and weather conditions.\nC. Prediction model\nDue to the volatility of the meteorological conditions, the\npredicted solar irradiation might differ from the one that realize\nduring the real-time operation of the building. The difference\nbetween the predicted value and the realized value is called\nprediction error or uncertainty. Considering the fact that the\nsolar irradiation features high frequency variations, the method\nmodels the solar irradiation through a set of scenarios, i.e. 𝕊, to\naccount for the prediction errors. Moreover, it models each\nscenario with time resolution of 1-minute to better capture the\ntemporal variations of the solar irradiation over each time slot.\nThis 1-minute duration is called sub-slot as shown in Fig. 9.\nAccordingly, the uncertainty-cognizant MPC strategy is able to\nbetter ensure the thermal comfort of the residents in comparison\n\n10\nTable 1.

The internal heat load of examined building.\nwith common MPC strategies that generally model the solar\nirradiation with a single scenario (i.e. point prediction) and\nlong-time resolutions range between 30-minute to 1-hour. To\nmodel the set of scenarios 𝕊, the paper relies on a Training\nData Set consisting of a series of historical measured solar\nirradiation (G\nT \n(w/m\n2\n)) over the last 10 years with time\nresolution of 1 minute. Then, a machine learning based\napproach, i.e. k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm [42], is\nexploited to generate 100 scenarios modeling the solar\nirradiation over the upcoming sub-slots (𝜅, 𝜅 + 1, …, 1440).\nConsidering the fact that the ambient temperature has a very\nmoderate variation over time, this method only accounts for the\npoint prediction of the ambient temperature over the upcoming\ntime slots and it does not account for the prediction error of the\nambient temperature. Moreover, this method models the\nambient temperature with time resolution equal to the duration\nof a time slot, i.e. 30 minutes. In this respect, this paper relies\non a Training Data Set consisting of a series of historical\nmeasured ambient temperature over the last 10 years with time\nresolution of 15 minutes. It is worth highlighting that this data\nset has been received from Iran Meteorological Organization\n(IMO). Then, k-NN algorithm is exploited to predict the\nambient temperature over the upcoming time slots (k, k +1,…,\n48).\nIV.

The parameters of\nthe building thermal model, i.e. resistances and capacitances\nintroduced in section II.B, are reported in Table 1. It is worth\nhighlighting that these parameters are calculated by applying a\nGA-based parameter identification approach on historical\nthermal data of a typical building in Tehran, Iran [43].

The\nprofiles of all these terms over 24 hours of study are shown in\nFig. 12.\nThe building’s energy system is formed of 1-a PVT-air dual\nsource heat pump with R-32 refrigerant, 2-a 2000-liter water\nstorage tank with a height-over-diameter ratio of 4 as a TESS,\n3-a water-based covered photovoltaic thermal (PVT) collector\nwith front glazing, rear collector cover and no thermal\ninsulation material on the back of the PVT absorber, 4-\ncirculation pumps and 5-FCUs. The performance coefficients\nof the PVT collector are reported in Table 2 [31,32].\nConsidering the fact that the hourly electricity prices are\ndetermined in the day-ahead electricity market (a day prior to\nreal-time operation), this study assumes that the hourly\nelectricity prices are known/given. More specifically, the\nhourly electricity prices are extracted from the published data\nby Iran Electricity Market (IEMA). The profile of the hourly\nelectricity prices over 24 hours of the study, i.e. 10 January\n2021, is shown in Fig. 13.\nAll prediction and simulations are carried out using\nMATLAB. Moreover, the stochastic MPC optimization\nproblem is modeled by using YALMIP-MATLAB and solved\n\n11\nwith GUROBI solver on a Windows based system with a AMD\nRyzen 5 3500U CPU and 16 GB RAM.\nV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA. Simulation results associated with uncertainty-cognizant\nMPC strategy (Controller 1)\nThis section presents the performance of the constructed\nuncertainty-cognizant MPC strategy for managing the building\nenergy system over a typical winter day. At the beginning of\neach time slot, the solar irradiation and ambient air temperature\nare firstly predicted following the method presented in section\nIII.C. Fig. 14 depicts all 100 scenarios modeling the solar\nirradiation (over the upcoming sub-slots) along with the\nrealized solar irradiation over the 24 hours of the study.\nMoreover, the point prediction of the solar irradiation is\ncalculated so that fifteen percent of scenarios are above it and\nthe 50 percent of scenarios are below it, i.e. quantile 50%. Fig.\n15 illustrates the predicted ambient air temperature along with\nthe realized one. Considering the predicted solar irradiation as\nwell as ambient temperature along with the model developed in\nsection II.C, the thermal and electric power generation of the\nPVT collector can be easily calculated (predicted) as shown in\nFig. 16. Finally, the stochastic MPC strategy presented in\nsection III are actuated at the beginning of each time slot to\noptimally steer the building’s energy system. Accordingly, the\noptimal operating points of the HP and FCU are determined.\nFig. 17 and Fig. 18 respectively show the HP and FCU\noperating points (i.e. off/on state) along with their output\nthermal power. Fig. 19 illustrates the evolution of the building’s\nindoor air temperature and TESS water temperature over the\nwhole day. As it can be seen, the method manages to keep the\nindoor air temperature and TESS water temperature within their\ndesired ranges, thereby, preserving the thermal comfort of the\nresidents. Moreover, from 00:00 to 06:00 where the electricity\nprice is low, the method repeatedly turns on the HP and FCU to\nstore thermal energy in the thermal capacities of the TESS and\nbuilding (i.e. increases the TESS water temperature and keep\nthe indoor air temperature higher than the minimum acceptable\nindoor air temperature). To better discover the capability of the\nmethod in optimally steering the building’s energy system, Fig.\n20 shows the net electric power that the building exchanged\nwith the grid over 24 hours of study. In Fig. 20, positive values\nmean that the building absorbed (i.e. purchased) electricity\nfrom the grid, while the negative values mean that the building\ninjected (i.e. sold) electricity to the grid. As it can be seen, the\nmethod leverages the thermal capacities of the TESS and\nbuilding to shift the building’s electricity consumption from the\nperiods with high prices to periods with low prices, thereby,\ndecreasing the operating cost of the building’s energy system.\nMore specifically, the method turns on the HP during periods\nwith low prices, thereby, storing thermal energy in the TESS.\nThen, during periods with high prices (9:00 am and 3:00 pm),\nthe method turns off the HP and discharges the TESS. In this\nway, the building is empowered to sell electricity to the grid\nduring periods with high prices and consume electricity mainly\nduring periods with low prices.\nThe building’s net purchased electricity over the whole day\nFig. 14.

Simulation results associated with thermostatic controller\n(Controller 2)\nThis section aims to better unfold the advantages of the\nconstructed uncertainty-cognizant MPC strategy (Controller 1)\nby comparing its performance with the thermostatic controllers\n(Controller 2) that are widely used to manage the building’s\nenergy system. To this end, it is assumed that two thermostatic\ncontrollers (Controller 2) are used to manage the building’s\nenergy system, i.e. FCU and HP. These thermostatic controllers\n(Controller 2) can allow the residents to only determine a single\nset-point for the indoor air temperature, i.e. 𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑆𝑒𝑡−𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡\n, and\nTESS water temperature, i.e. 𝑇\n𝑇𝐸𝑆𝑆\n𝑆𝑒𝑡−𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡\n, instead of allowing the\nresidents to determine a range for the indoor air temperature and\nTESS water temperature. A hysteresis controller is used to\ncontrol the FCU. This controller turns on the FCU when the\nindoor air temperature goes bellow the determined setpoint\n𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑆𝑒𝑡−𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 \nand vice versa. The other controller is in charge of\nthe HP. This controller turns on the HP when the TESS water\ntemperature goes bellow the determined setpoint 𝑇\n𝑇𝐸𝑆𝑆\n𝑆𝑒𝑡−𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡\nand\nvice versa. The performance of the thermostatic controller (i.e.\nController 2) is completely dependent on the determined set-\npoints 𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑆𝑒𝑡−𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 \nand 𝑇\n𝑇𝐸𝑆𝑆\n𝑆𝑒𝑡−𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡\n. This section sets these set-\npoints (i.e. 𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑆𝑒𝑡−𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 \nand 𝑇\n𝑇𝐸𝑆𝑆\n𝑆𝑒𝑡−𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡\n) via try and error so that\nthe indoor air temperature is kept as low as possible while:\n1-the thermal comfort of the residents is respected\nthroughout the 24 hours of the study, i.e. 𝑇\n𝑖𝑛 \nstays between 19\no\nC\nand 23\no\nC.\nFig. 21. Controller 2: The HP off/on state (0 or 1 binary variables), HP\nconsumed electric power (𝑃\n𝑒,𝐻𝑃\n), and HP output thermal power (𝑃\n𝑡ℎ,𝐻𝑃\n) over\n24 hours of study.\nFig. 22.

Therefore, a fair\ncomparison can be drawn between Controller 1 and Controller\n2. Following the above-mentioned try and error procedure,\n𝑇\n𝑖𝑛\n𝑆𝑒𝑡−𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 \nand 𝑇\n𝑇𝐸𝑆𝑆\n𝑆𝑒𝑡−𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡 \nare respectively set 19.7 \no\nC and 65\no\nC. The performance of the thermostatic controllers (i.e.\nController 2) are shown in Fig. 21 to Fig. 24. Fig. 21 and Fig.\n22 respectively show the HP and FCU operating points (i.e.\noff/on state) along with their output thermal power. Fig. 23\nillustrates the evolution of the building’s indoor air temperature\nand TESS water temperature over the whole day. As it can be\nseen, the thermostatic controller keeps the building’s indoor air\ntemperature around the set-point 19.7 \no\nC.

As it can be seen, the thermostatic\ncontroller (i.e. Controller 2) never can shift the building’s\nelectricity consumption from the periods with high prices to\nperiods with low prices because:\n1- the thermostatic controller solely relies on the real-time\nmeasurements,\n2- the thermostatic controller is not able to take advantage\nfrom the prediction of solar irradiation and ambient air\ntemperature, thereby, cannot take advantage from the\nthermal capacities of the TESS.\nTo put it simply, the thermostatic controller (i.e. Controller\n2) cannot decrease the operating cost of the building’s energy\nsystem.\nRelying on the thermostatic controller (i.e. Controller 2), the\nbuilding’s net purchased electricity over the whole day is 239\nkWh (i.e. equal to the area under the curve shown in Fig. 24).\nConsidering the variable electricity price over the day, the\nbuilding’s electricity cost over the whole day is 1,215 cents.\nTo better unfold the advantage of controller 1, Table 3\nsummaries the performance of the uncertainty-cognizant MPC\nstrategy (i.e. Controller 1) and thermostatic controller (i.e.\nController 2). This table reveals that controller 1 results in 31%\nless electric power consumption and 81% electricity cost saving\nin comparison with controller 2. It is worth highlighting that\ncontroller 1 achieved a much better performance due to 1-taking\nadvantage from the thermal capacities of the TESS and the\nbuilding 2-accounting for the temporal variation of the\nelectricity price, solar irradiation and ambient temperature over\nthe upcoming time-slots.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper advocates for the employment of uncertainty-\ncognizant model predictive control (MPC) strategy for\noptimally operating smart buildings equipped with grid-\nconnected photovoltaic-thermal (PVT) collectors, heat pump\n(HP) system, thermal energy storage system (TESS) and fan\ncoil unit (FCU). In this context, it constructed a stochastic MPC\nstrategy to maximize the building’s self-consumption and\nconsequently minimize building’s electricity cost while\nconsidering the temporal variations of the electricity price (i.e.\ntime-of-use (TOU) tariff), renewable energy resources (RES)\ngeneration, and outdoor ambient air temperature over the whole\nday. More specifically, the presented method minimizes the\nbuilding’s electric power consumption (and more importantly\nthe building’s electricity cost) while preserving the thermal\ncomfort of the residents. The uncertainties associated with RES\nwere also modeled by k-NN algorithm through defining a set of\nscenarios to strengthen the modeling the RES power generation.\nA single-family residential building is used to validate the\nperformance of the proposed method. The achieved results\nshow that the proposed stochastic MPC significantly decreases\nthe building’s total electricity consumption about 75 kWh\n(31%) resulting in 991 cent (81%) energy cost saving by\nshifting the HP and FCU loads while keeping the indoor\ntemperature within its allowable temperature range. It is of\ngreat importance to note that the proposed method takes the\nadvantage of the thermal energy storage capacity to shift the\nbuilding’s energy consumption from peak to off-peak hours,\nthereby, reducing the building’s electricity cost over the whole\nday.\n\n14\nREFERENCES\n[1] Omer, A.M., 2008.

  "text": " Ecco un breve riassunto in italiano dell'introduzione dell'articolo che ho caricato:\n\nIl settore edilizio è responsabile di circa il 40% del consumo energetico globale e delle relative emissioni di CO2. Per raggiungere gli obiettivi climatici è quindi di fondamentale importanza modernizzare i sistemi di gestione dell'energia negli edifici e integrare le fonti di energia rinnovabile in questo settore. Tuttavia, l'energia generata da fonti rinnovabili come il solare non segue la domanda energetica dell'edificio. Inoltre, la domanda energetica degli edifici è volatile e può causare congestioni della rete elettrica durante le ore di picco. Per superare questi problemi, in questo articolo viene proposto un sistema energetico per edifici composto da una pompa di calore, un sistema di accumulo di energia termica e collettori solari fotovoltaici termici. Viene sviluppata una strategia di controllo predittivo stocastico per determinare il setpoint ottimale dell'intero sistema energetico dell'edificio, tenendo conto delle incertezze associate alla generazione di energia solare. In questo modo l'edificio è in grado di spostare la domanda elettrica dalle ore di picco a quelle di basso carico e di vendere elettricità alla rete.",

  "text": " Based on my review of the paper, there are a few recent developments related to hybrid photovoltaic thermal (PVT) solar collectors that are discussed:\n\n- Use of nanofluids as the heat transfer fluid: The paper mentions that recent studies have explored using nanofluids as the heat transfer fluid in PVT collectors instead of water. The suspended nanoparticles can enhance the thermal conductivity and heat transfer coefficient of the fluid. This can potentially improve the overall efficiency of the PVT collector.\n\n- Spectrally selective coatings on the absorber plate: Some recent studies have worked on using spectrally selective coatings on the absorber plate of PVT collectors. These coatings have higher absorptivity in the visible range for PV operation and higher reflectivity in the infrared range to reduce thermal emission losses. This can help improve the electrical and thermal efficiency of the PVT collector.\n\n- Hybrid PVT designs with concentrators: Concentrators like compound parabolic concentrators are being used along with PVT collectors. The concentrators focus more solar radiation onto the PV cells to boost electricity generation, while the thermal energy is captured from the heated absorber plate. This hybrid design can improve the overall utilization of the solar spectrum.\n\n- Heat pipe based PVT collectors: Heat pipes integrated with the PVT absorber plate can help improve heat removal and thermal efficiency. The evaporator section of the heat pipe is bonded to the absorber plate while the condensed heat is transferred to the heat transfer fluid. This allows better thermal management.\n\n- Use of glazed and unglazed PVT collectors: Glazed PVT collectors with a glass cover reduce convection losses but increase cost. Unglazed PVT collectors without a cover are cheaper but lose more heat to the ambient. Tradeoffs between glazed and unglazed PVTs are being explored.\n\nIn summary, recent PVT developments have focused on advanced materials, optical enhancements, heat transfer improvements and design optimizations to improve the overall conversion efficiency and performance.",

  "text": " Ecco una traduzione in italiano della mia risposta precedente relativa agli sviluppi recenti dei collettori solari ibridi fotovoltaici termici discussi nell'articolo:\n\n- Uso di nanofluidi come fluido termovettore: l'articolo menziona che studi recenti hanno esplorato l'uso di nanofluidi come fluido termovettore nei collettori PVT invece che l'acqua. Le nanoparticelle sospese possono migliorare la conducibilità termica e il coefficiente di scambio termico del fluido. Questo può potenzialmente migliorare l'efficienza complessiva del collettore PVT. \n\n- Rivestimenti spettralmente selettivi sulla piastra assorbitrice: alcuni studi recenti hanno lavorato su rivestimenti spettralmente selettivi sulla piastra assorbitrice dei collettori PVT. Questi rivestimenti hanno una maggiore assorbanza nella banda visibile per il funzionamento fotovoltaico e una maggiore riflettività nella banda infrarossa per ridurre le perdite di emissione termica. Ciò può aiutare a migliorare l'efficienza elettrica e termica del collettore PVT.\n\n- Design ibridi PVT con concentratore: concentratotori come i concentratotori parabolici composti vengono utilizzati insieme ai collettori PVT. I concentratotori concentrano più radiazione solare sulle celle fotovoltaiche per aumentare la produzione di elettricità, mentre l'energia termica viene catturata dalla piastra assorbitrice riscaldata. Questo design ibrido può migliorare l'utilizzo complessivo dello spettro solare. \n\n- Collettori PVT a tubi heat-pipe: i tubi heat-pipe integrati con la piastra assorbitrice PVT possono aiutare a migliorare la rimozione del calore e l'efficienza termica. La sezione evaporatrice del tubo heat-pipe è legata alla piastra assorbitrice mentre il calore condensato viene trasferito al fluido termovettore. Ciò consente una migliore gestione termica.\n\n- Uso di collettori PVT vetrati e non vetrati: i collettori PVT vetrati con una copertura in vetro riducono le perdite per convezione ma aumentano i costi. I collettori PVT non vetrati senza copertura sono più economici ma perdono più calore nell'ambiente circostante. Si stanno esplorando varie soluzioni tra PVT vetrati e non vetrati. \n\nIn sintesi, gli sviluppi recenti dei PVT si sono concentrati su materiali avanzati, miglioramenti ottici, miglioramenti del trasferimento di calore e ottimizzazioni di progettazione per migliorare l'efficienza di conversione complessiva e le prestazioni.",
