  "text": "I would like a nodejs implementation of an xmpp server broker, that supports multiuser chatrooms and all the other features.  Something like a lightweight version of ejabberd that runs on node. Please can you suggest some alternatives. My priorities are popularity & current maintenance, standards compliance, features and supporting libraries. It must be open source, Github repo preferred.",

Evaluate options based on criteria\n3. Compare features and compliance\n4. Assess community support and maintenance\n\nSolution:\nProsody-io/node-xmpp-server is the most suitable option. It's a popular, actively maintained, standards-compliant XMPP server implementation for Node.js. It supports multi-user chat rooms and offers a comprehensive feature set. The project is open-source and hosted on GitHub.\n\nq1: What are the key features of node-xmpp-server?\nq2: How does node-xmpp-server compare to ejabberd in terms of performance?\nq3: Are there any notable limitations of node-xmpp-server?\nq4: What other XMPP libraries integrate well with node-xmpp-server?",
