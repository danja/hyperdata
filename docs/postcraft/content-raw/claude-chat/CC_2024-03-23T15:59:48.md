  "text": " Solid Community Server does not directly integrate with LDAP or other central user management systems out-of-the-box. However, it is designed to work with WebID, which is a decentralized way of identifying users on the web.\n\nWith WebID, each user has a WebID profile document that contains information about them, including their public keys for authentication. This profile document is hosted somewhere on the web, often on the user's own Solid pod or server.\n\nTo authenticate with Solid Community Server using WebID, users provide the URL of their WebID profile document. The server then fetches this document, verifies the user's identity based on the public keys, and grants access accordingly.\n\nWhile this approach is decentralized and aligns with Solid principles, it may not meet your need for a centralized user management system like LDAP. However, there are a few potential options:\n\n1. **Custom integration**: You could develop a custom integration between Solid Community Server and your preferred user management system. This would involve writing code to handle user authentication and account management based on your central system.\n\n2. **Use WebID-OIDC**: The WebID-OIDC project provides a bridge between WebID and standard OpenID Connect, which allows integrating WebID authentication with platforms that support OIDC. You could set up an OIDC provider and configure Solid Community Server to use it.\n\n3. **Use an Identity Provider**: Some Identity Providers (IdPs) like Inrupt offer managed solutions that can integrate with Solid apps and provide user authentication and management. This could give you a more centralized approach, though at an additional cost.\n\nUltimately, the decentralized nature of Solid favors the WebID approach, but integrating with a central user management system will require some custom development work or the use of third-party solutions.",

  "text": " Yes, it is possible to use WebID-OIDC with LDAP as the underlying user store connected to the Solid Community Server. Here's how you could approach this:\n\n1. **Set up an OIDC Provider**: You'll need an OpenID Connect Provider that can authenticate users against your LDAP directory. There are several opensource OIDC providers that support LDAP integration out-of-the-box like Keycloak, Dex, or midPoint.\n\n2. **Configure OIDC Provider with LDAP**: In your chosen OIDC provider, you'll configure it to use LDAP as the user store. This typically involves providing the LDAP server details, baseDNs for searching, bind credentials etc.\n\n3. **Install WebID-OIDC**: On your server, you'll install and configure the WebID-OIDC authentication proxy (https://github.com/solid/webid-oidc-proxy).\n\n4. **Configure WebID-OIDC with OIDC Provider**: Point the WebID-OIDC proxy to your OIDC provider by supplying the provider's metadata URL or configuration details.\n\n5. **Configure Solid Server with WebID-OIDC**: Finally, configure the Solid Community Server to use WebID-OIDC for authentication by proxying requests through the WebID-OIDC proxy.\n\nWith this setup, when users try to log into the Solid server, the WebID-OIDC proxy will trigger the OIDC authentication flow. The OIDC provider will then authenticate against the LDAP directory. Upon successful authentication, the user's WebID profile will be generated/fetched, and they'll be logged into the Solid server.\n\nThis approach allows you to maintain a central LDAP user directory while still integrating with the Solid ecosystem using the WebID standards. The WebID-OIDC proxy acts as a bridge between the OIDC world and the Solid world.",
