'http://example.org/xyz1' will resolve to 'https://example.org/very/long/url', where 'xyz1' is derived from 'very/long/url' using something like a tweaked hash algorithm.  I'd like it so the short URL isn't totally unmemorable, a compromise between legibility and brevity. As a first step, can you please suggest some potential algorithms that might be suitable, with examples of their input and output. I'd like it to be simple, portable and fast. No DB, and  if any kind of lookup table is used, it should be minimal, like max 100 entries. What do you think?",
