  "text": " This image shows a cookie cutter held in someone's hand. The cookie cutter has an unusual shape that could be interpreted in different ways, which explains why the poster says it has confused them for over a year.\n\nThe shape of the cookie cutter appears to be a stylized representation of a teapot or kettle. It has a rounded body with a spout on one side and what looks like a handle on the opposite side. The top has a small protrusion that could represent the lid or opening of the teapot.\n\nHowever, the ambiguity in its design is likely what's causing confusion. Depending on how you look at it, the shape could potentially be interpreted as other objects as well, which is probably why the original poster found it puzzling.\n\nThe image is from a Reddit post in the \"r/whatismycookiecutter\" subreddit, where users share and try to identify unusual or confusing cookie cutter shapes.",
