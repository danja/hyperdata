  "text": " To get a Node.js async function to return the resolved result rather than a Promise, you need to use `await` when calling the async function. However, this can only be done within another async function or at the top level of a module (in Node.js versions that support top-level await).\n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```javascript\nasync function asyncFunction() {\n  return \"Hello, World!\";\n}\n\n// This won't work (returns a Promise):\nlet result = asyncFunction();\n\n// This will work (inside another async function):\nasync function getResult() {\n  let result = await asyncFunction();\n  console.log(result); // Outputs: Hello, World!\n  return result;\n}\n\n// Or at the top level in supported Node.js versions:\n// (async () => {\n//   let result = await asyncFunction();\n//   console.log(result); // Outputs: Hello, World!\n// })();\n```\n\nIn this example, `asyncFunction()` returns a Promise that resolves to \"Hello, World!\". To get the actual string value:\n\n1. Use `await` when calling the function.\n2. Make sure you're using `await` inside another async function or at the top level of a module (if your Node.js version supports it).\n\nIf you need to use the result in a non-async context, you can use `.then()` method:\n\n```javascript\nasyncFunction().then(result => {\n  console.log(result); // Outputs: Hello, World!\n});\n```\n\nRemember that you can't use `await` in regular synchronous functions. If you find yourself needing to do this often, you might want to reconsider your overall approach to asynchronous operations in your application.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of this in more detail?",
