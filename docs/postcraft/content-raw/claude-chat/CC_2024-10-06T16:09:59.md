  "text": " The word you may be looking for is \"shenanigans.\" \n\nThis term is often used humorously or ironically to describe mischievous or questionable behavior, sometimes including more serious misdeeds. It can downplay the gravity of actions by framing them as playful or trivial.\n\nFor example, someone might sarcastically refer to a major financial scandal as \"just some Wall Street shenanigans\" or describe a crime spree as \"those hooligans and their shenanigans.\"\n\nWhile \"shenanigans\" can refer to harmless pranks or silly behavior, its use for more serious transgressions creates an ironic contrast that can be darkly humorous. However, this lighthearted framing of serious issues could be seen as inappropriate in some contexts.",
