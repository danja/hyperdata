  "text": "I understand you want to find a humane solution. Here are some non-lethal suggestions to consider:\n\n- Use humane traps to catch the mice and release them far away in a field or park. Be sure it's legal in your area first. \n\n- Seal up any entry points so more mice can't get in. Steel wool stuffed in cracks works well.\n\n- Keep all human and pet food in sealed metal or glass containers so there's nothing for them to eat. Clean up all crumbs.\n\n- Use natural peppermint oil deterrents. Mice don't like the smell. \n\n- Consider adopting a cat - they can be great mousers without actually killing them. The mice may leave from the cat's presence and scent alone.\n\n- As a last resort if the mice are truly overrunning your home, contact a pest control company to explore options like relocation or humane deterrents.\n\nI hope these give you some ideas to humanely and safely evict the mice. Let me know if you have any other questions!",
