  "text": " Based on your description, it sounds like you may have encountered a Western Whip Snake (Hierophis viridiflavus), also known as the European Whip Snake. Here are some details that match your observation:\n\n1. Size: These snakes can grow up to 150 cm, but juveniles and younger adults often measure around 40-60 cm, fitting your observed length.\n\n2. Body shape: They are known for their slim, elongated bodies.\n\n3. Coloration: While adults are typically green and yellow (hence the Latin name \"viridiflavus\"), juveniles and some adults can have a pattern of yellow and black stripes running along their body.\n\n4. Location: This species is common in Italy, including Tuscany.\n\n5. Behavior: They are diurnal (active during the day) and often seen basking in the sun or moving through vegetation.\n\nIt's important to note that snake identification can be tricky, especially without a clear photo. The Western Whip Snake is non-venomous and generally harmless to humans, but it's always best to observe snakes from a safe distance.\n\nWould you like more information about this species or other snakes found in Tuscany?",

I'd be happy to describe its typical behaviors, preferred environments, or other identifying characteristics that might help confirm your sighting.",
