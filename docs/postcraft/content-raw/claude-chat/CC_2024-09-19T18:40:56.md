  "text": " While black rice is not as traditional in Italian or Spanish cuisine as it is in Asian cuisines, there are some modern dishes that incorporate black rice in these Mediterranean cuisines. Here are a few examples:\n\nItalian dishes:\n\n1. Risotto al nero: A variation of traditional risotto made with black rice, often paired with seafood like squid or shrimp.\n\n2. Insalata di riso nero: A cold black rice salad, typically mixed with vegetables, herbs, and a light dressing.\n\n3. Torta di riso nero: A savory black rice tart or pie, sometimes made with cheese and vegetables.\n\nSpanish dishes:\n\n1. Arroz negro: While traditionally made with squid ink to color white rice black, some modern versions use actual black rice for a similar visual effect and nutty flavor.\n\n2. Paella negra: A variation of paella using black rice instead of the traditional white or yellow rice.\n\n3. Ensalada de arroz negro: A black rice salad, often incorporating Mediterranean ingredients like olives, tomatoes, and herbs.\n\nIt's worth noting that these dishes are more contemporary interpretations rather than long-standing traditional recipes. Chefs in both countries have been experimenting with black rice to create new dishes that blend local flavors with this interesting ingredient. Would you like more details on any of these dishes or how they're prepared?",
