Here's a one-line summary of the task:\n\nExtract the last part of a URL using JavaScript.\n\nSolution:\n```javascript\nconst className = 'http://hyperdata.it/transmissions/Concat'.split('/').pop();\n```\n\nThis line of code splits the URL by '/' and returns the last element, which is 'Concat'.\n\nq1: What does the `split()` method do in JavaScript?\nq2: How does the `pop()` method work with arrays?\nq3: Are there any potential issues with this approach for different URL formats?\nq4: What are some alternative methods to achieve the same result?",
