  "text": " Based on my knowledge up to 2022, here are the key parts of manim:\n\n1. Scene: The fundamental unit of a manim animation, containing all objects and animations.\n\n2. Mobjects (Mathematical Objects): Basic elements like shapes, text, graphs, etc.\n\n3. Animations: Methods to transform or move Mobjects.\n\n4. Camera: Controls what's visible in the scene.\n\n5. Coordinate Systems: For positioning objects in 2D or 3D space.\n\n6. Configuration: Settings for rendering, quality, and output format.\n\n7. Command Line Interface: For running animations and setting parameters.\n\n8. Inheritance System: Allows creation of custom objects and animations.\n\nQ1: Are you interested in a specific feature or capability of manim?\n\nQ2: Do you need help understanding how these components interact in a typical manim project?\n\nQ3: Would you like to see a simple code example demonstrating these key parts?",
