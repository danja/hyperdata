  "text": " These are Git configuration options for handling pull operations:\n\n1. `git config pull.rebase false`: Uses merge strategy. Preferred when you want to preserve the exact history and create merge commits.\n\n2. `git config pull.rebase true`: Uses rebase strategy. Useful for keeping a linear history and avoiding merge commits. Good for cleaner project histories.\n\n3. `git config pull.ff only`: Allows only fast-forward merges. Best when you want to ensure your local branch is always up-to-date with the remote before integrating changes.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these options or their implications?",
