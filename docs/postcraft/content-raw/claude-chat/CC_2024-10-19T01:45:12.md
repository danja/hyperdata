  "text": " The non-Newtonian fluid you're referring to that was sold as a toy is commonly known as \"Silly Putty.\"\n\nSilly Putty was accidentally invented in 1943 during World War II when James Wright, an engineer at General Electric, was attempting to create a synthetic rubber substitute. The resulting material had some unique properties:\n\n1. It could bounce when dropped\n2. It could stretch without breaking\n3. It could flow like a liquid if left alone\n\nThese properties made it a non-Newtonian fluid, meaning its viscosity changes when stress is applied. While it wasn't suitable for its original intended purpose, it became a popular toy after being marketed by Peter Hodgson in 1949.\n\nSilly Putty became known for its ability to pick up ink from newspaper comics and other printed materials, as well as its malleability and strange physical properties. It remains a popular toy and stress-relief tool to this day.\n\nWould you like more information about the science behind Silly Putty or its history?",
