  "text": " While the Bible describes God's creation of animals, it doesn't specifically mention mice. In Genesis 1:24-25, land animals were created on the sixth day: \"And God said, 'Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kindsâ€”livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds.' And it was so. And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the livestock according to their kinds, and everything that creeps on the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.\"\n\nMice would fall under either \"creeping things\" or \"beasts of the earth,\" both created on day six. However, the Bible uses broad categories rather than listing specific species.",
