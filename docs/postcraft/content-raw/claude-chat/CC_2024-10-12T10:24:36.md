  "text": "5 levels of preconceptions\n\nI'm trying to pin down a psychological phenomenon I believe I have observed. It is a contrast in certain ways of thinking between people who have ADHD traits and those considered normal. I'll describe this to you by way of an example, I'd like you to identify any general patterns that may be at work.\nThe example that led me here is OpenAI's 5 steps towards artificial general intelligence. They have steps of conversational AI, reasoning, autonomy, innovating, organizational.\nThey sell a conversational AI service, and this is associated with their marketing, so clearly to some degree their roadmap is retrofitted to a path their company can be seen to be following. The 'organizational' level concerns artificial intelligence that is capable of performing the work of an entire organization. Again, this may be targeting the commercial world, but I've read other discussion of these steps justifying this trajectory. \nBut as a person diagnosed with ADHD the steps here look fundamentally misguided. Firstly the notion of agi described is strongly tied to human-like intelligence. To me that seems wrong because what humans display is a special case arrived at by a particular set of circumstances, physics, evolution etc. I would start by trying to abstract out the concept we call intelligence. The generality part I would take as being the ability to reuse the same core system, adapting as necessary, to solve new tasks.\nThere aren't many examples to draw from, but we do have the natural kingdom at large. By rating creatures on how intelligent we would say they were,  noting the charactistics, we may get to a more useful definition that may also be applied to artificial intelligence.\nWith conversation seen as key to intelligence, again we have a human perspective. \nWith reasoning, we already have logical reasoners, eg. A prolog engine. Reasoning seems tangential to the ability to converse.  Autonomy is an interesting one. Once wound up a mechanical clock will operate autonomously. In these steps the intention is for agents to do complex tasks, but the actual idea of what agency is doesn't seem to be captured. Innovation is difficult to abstract from the human context, but exploring and testing unknown systems is in there. Also use of tools, in humans and animals may offer clues. The organizational level has a lot I like. But if you consider that ant colonies are very successful organizations, but individual ants aren't considered verybintelligent. There's a mismatch \nOverall the approach takes a monolithic view of intelligence, as if agi Is a single person. In the real world, intelligence emerges in the context of societies. This aspect is fundamental, yet appears only in the last step. \nBut when I try to think about how best to approach agi, It seems obvious that a more open approach is needed. All the steps are based on bad assumptions, and the conclusions carried up vertically.\nI'm not entirely sure what you'd call the fallacies involved, but it seems like a systematic application of them.\nSo what I'd like to pin down are the modes of thinking employed. Contrasting neurotypical and neurodiverse.\nPeople talk about thinking outside the box, this seems useful, modified a little. If the box is taken to be constraints and areas of knowledge, where those barriers are placed is significant. In these steps it feels like an overarching box is used, to only consider intelligence in human terms. This artificially limits exploration of the problem space, negatively impacts creativity.",

  "text": " Your observations highlight an interesting contrast in approaches to conceptualizing artificial general intelligence (AGI). Let's analyze the patterns you've described and explore the potential differences in thinking styles:\n\n1. Anthropocentric vs. Abstract Thinking\n   - Neurotypical approach: Tends to frame AGI in human-centric terms, using human intelligence as the primary model.\n   - Neurodiverse approach: More inclined to abstract the concept of intelligence beyond human examples, considering a broader range of cognitive systems found in nature.\n\n2. Linear vs. Non-linear Progression\n   - Neurotypical approach: Often views progress towards AGI as a linear, step-by-step process with clear milestones.\n   - Neurodiverse approach: May see intelligence development as more non-linear, with interconnected aspects developing simultaneously or in unexpected orders.\n\n3. Monolithic vs. Distributed Intelligence\n   - Neurotypical approach: Tends to conceptualize AGI as a singular, human-like entity.\n   - Neurodiverse approach: More likely to consider distributed or emergent forms of intelligence, such as those found in ant colonies or ecosystems.\n\n4. Constrained vs. Open-ended Problem Solving\n   - Neurotypical approach: May work within established frameworks and assumptions about intelligence.\n   - Neurodiverse approach: More likely to question fundamental assumptions and explore unconventional solutions.\n\n5. Task-oriented vs. Systems-oriented Thinking\n   - Neurotypical approach: Focuses on specific capabilities or tasks (e.g., conversation, reasoning) as markers of intelligence.\n   - Neurodiverse approach: More inclined to consider the underlying systems and adaptability that enable diverse forms of intelligence.\n\n6. Commercial vs. Theoretical Focus\n   - Neurotypical approach: May be more influenced by immediate practical or commercial applications.\n   - Neurodiverse approach: Potentially more focused on theoretical underpinnings and long-term implications.\n\n7. Categorical vs. Spectrum Thinking\n   - Neurotypical approach: May tend to categorize intelligence into distinct levels or types.\n   - Neurodiverse approach: More likely to view intelligence as a spectrum with many interconnected facets.\n\n8. Contextual Consideration\n   - Neurotypical approach: Might focus more on intelligence as an individual trait.\n   - Neurodiverse approach: More likely to consider the role of environment, society, and context in the emergence of intelligence.\n\n9. Assumption Challenging\n   - Neurotypical approach: May be more likely to build upon existing assumptions and frameworks.\n   - Neurodiverse approach: More inclined to question fundamental assumptions and \"think outside the box.\"\n\n10. Analogical Thinking\n    - Neurotypical approach: Might rely more heavily on human intelligence as the primary analogy for AGI.\n    - Neurodiverse approach: More likely to draw analogies from diverse sources in nature and abstract systems.\n\nThe contrast you've described could be characterized as a difference between convergent thinking (more typical in neurotypical approaches) and divergent thinking (more common in neurodiverse approaches). The neurotypical approach seems to converge on human-like intelligence as the goal, while the neurodiverse approach diverges to consider a wider range of possibilities and abstractions.\n\nIt's important to note that these are generalizations, and individual thinking styles can vary greatly regardless of neurodiversity. Additionally, both approaches have their strengths and potential blind spots. A comprehensive approach to AGI development would likely benefit from incorporating diverse perspectives and thinking styles.",
