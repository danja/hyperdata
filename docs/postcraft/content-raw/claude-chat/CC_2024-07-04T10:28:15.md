  "text": " To update packages in a monorepo setup like this, you have a few options depending on what exactly you want to update. Here's a guide on how to handle different update scenarios:\n\n1. Updating all packages:\n\nFrom the root of your monorepo, you can run:\n\n```bash\nnpm update\n```\n\nThis will update all packages in all workspaces to their latest versions according to the version ranges specified in their package.json files.\n\n2. Updating a specific package across all workspaces:\n\n```bash\nnpm update <package-name> -ws\n```\n\nThe `-ws` flag tells npm to run the command in all workspaces.\n\n3. Updating packages in a specific workspace:\n\n```bash\nnpm update -w packages/<app-name>\n```\n\nThis updates all packages in the specified workspace.\n\n4. Updating a specific package in a specific workspace:\n\n```bash\nnpm update <package-name> -w packages/<app-name>\n```\n\n5. Checking for outdated packages:\n\nTo see which packages are outdated across all workspaces:\n\n```bash\nnpm outdated -ws\n```\n\n6. Upgrading to major versions:\n\nThe update command respects semver ranges in your package.json. To upgrade to new major versions:\n\n```bash\nnpm upgrade -ws\n```\n\nThis will update your package.json files with the new versions.\n\n7. Updating devDependencies in the root:\n\n```bash\nnpm update --dev\n```\n\n8. Updating the common package in all applications:\n\nIf you've made changes to your common package and want to update its version in all applications:\n\na. First, increment the version in packages/common/package.json\nb. Then, from the root directory, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @my-monorepo/common@latest -ws\n```\n\nThis will update the common package to the latest version in all workspaces.\n\nRemember to commit your package.json and package-lock.json files after making updates. It's also a good practice to run your tests after updating packages to ensure everything still works as expected.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any of these update methods or explain anything else about package management in this monorepo setup?",

  "text": "I want to create a monorepo for a set of related applications that share some common code. The code will be browser-based HTML, CSS and vanilla JS and nodejs using ES modules. I wish to use the following tools:\n- npm\n- jsdoc\n- chai\n- jasmine\n  The first three apps that will appear in the monorepo are called 'farelo', 'trellis' and 'strandz'. Can you advise on how to set up the monorepo and the tools for these apps, with a good dir structure, following best practices?",

  "text": " Certainly! I can help you set up a monorepo structure for your applications using the tools you've mentioned. Here's a recommended setup that follows best practices:\n\n1. First, create the monorepo root directory:\n\n```bash\nmkdir my-monorepo\ncd my-monorepo\n```\n\n2. Initialize the root-level package.json:\n\n```bash\nnpm init -y\n```\n\n3. Create a directory structure:\n\n```\nmy-monorepo/\n├── packages/\n│   ├── farelo/\n│   ├── trellis/\n│   ├── strandz/\n│   └── common/\n├── docs/\n├── tests/\n└── package.json\n```\n\n4. Set up each application and the common package:\n\n```bash\ncd packages\nmkdir farelo trellis strandz common\ncd ..\n```\n\n5. Initialize each package:\n\n```bash\ncd packages/farelo\nnpm init -y\ncd ../trellis\nnpm init -y\ncd ../strandz\nnpm init -y\ncd ../common\nnpm init -y\ncd ../..\n```\n\n6. Update the root package.json to use Workspaces:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-monorepo\",\n  \"private\": true,\n  \"workspaces\": [\n    \"packages/*\"\n  ],\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"jasmine\",\n    \"docs\": \"jsdoc -c jsdoc.json\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"chai\": \"^4.3.7\",\n    \"jasmine\": \"^4.6.0\",\n    \"jsdoc\": \"^4.0.2\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n7. Install the dev dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n8. Set up JSDoc configuration (jsdoc.json in the root):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"source\": {\n    \"include\": [\"packages\"],\n    \"excludePattern\": \"(node_modules|docs)\"\n  },\n  \"opts\": {\n    \"destination\": \"./docs/\",\n    \"recurse\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n9. Set up Jasmine (spec/support/jasmine.json in the root):\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p spec/support\ntouch spec/support/jasmine.json\n```\n\nAdd the following to jasmine.json:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"spec_dir\": \"tests\",\n  \"spec_files\": [\n    \"**/*[sS]pec.js\"\n  ],\n  \"helpers\": [\n    \"helpers/**/*.js\"\n  ],\n  \"stopSpecOnExpectationFailure\": false,\n  \"random\": true\n}\n```\n\n10. Create a basic structure for each application:\n\n```bash\nfor dir in packages/*; do\n  mkdir -p \"$dir\"/{src,tests,public}\n  touch \"$dir\"/src/index.js\n  touch \"$dir\"/public/index.html\ndone\n```\n\n11. Set up the common package:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p packages/common/{src,tests}\ntouch packages/common/src/index.js\n```\n\n12. Update each application's package.json to include the common package:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"@my-monorepo/common\": \"^1.0.0\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n13. Create a .gitignore file in the root:\n\n```\nnode_modules/\ndocs/\n*.log\n```\n\nThis structure allows you to:\n- Share common code across applications\n- Use npm workspaces for easier dependency management\n- Generate documentation with JSDoc\n- Run tests with Jasmine (and use Chai for assertions)\n- Keep each application separate while sharing a common build and test infrastructure\n\nTo use this setup:\n- Run `npm test` from the root to run all tests\n- Run `npm run docs` to generate documentation\n- Use `npm run <script> -w packages/<app-name>` to run scripts for a specific app\n\nRemember to add appropriate scripts to each application's package.json for building, serving, and testing individual applications.\n\nWould you like me to explain or elaborate on any part of this setup?",
