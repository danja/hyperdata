  "text": " The time periods between mood swings in bipolar disorder can vary significantly depending on the individual and the specific type of bipolar disorder. Here's a general overview:\n\n1. Bipolar I Disorder:\n   - Manic episodes typically last at least 7 days\n   - Depressive episodes usually last at least 2 weeks\n   - The interval between episodes (euthymic period) can last months to years\n\n2. Bipolar II Disorder:\n   - Hypomanic episodes usually last at least 4 days\n   - Depressive episodes tend to last at least 2 weeks\n   - Cycles may be more frequent than in Bipolar I\n\n3. Rapid Cycling:\n   - Defined as four or more mood episodes within a 12-month period\n   - Episodes can occur multiple times a week, or even within a single day\n\n4. Cyclothymic Disorder:\n   - Numerous periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms lasting for at least 2 years\n   - Symptoms don't meet full criteria for hypomanic or depressive episodes\n\nIt's important to note that these are general patterns, and individual experiences can vary widely. Some people may have more frequent mood swings, while others may have longer periods of stability between episodes. Factors such as stress, sleep disturbances, substance use, and medication adherence can all influence the frequency and duration of mood episodes.\n\nWould you like more information on any specific aspect of bipolar disorder and its mood patterns?",
