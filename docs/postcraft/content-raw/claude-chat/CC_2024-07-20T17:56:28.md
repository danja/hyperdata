  "text": " To send a file over Bluetooth from an Android device, follow these steps:\n\n1. Turn on Bluetooth on both devices.\n\n2. Pair your Android device with the receiving device if not already paired.\n\n3. Open the file you want to send.\n\n4. Tap the share button (usually looks like three connected dots).\n\n5. Select \"Bluetooth\" from the sharing options.\n\n6. Choose the paired device you want to send the file to.\n\n7. On the receiving device, accept the incoming file transfer.\n\nThe exact steps may vary slightly depending on your Android version and device manufacturer. If you need more detailed instructions for a specific Android device or encounter any issues, let me know and I can provide further guidance.",
