  "text": " I can help you with that. Here's how you can set an environment variable for a password and create a bash script to use it for SSH login:\n\n<antThinking>This request involves creating a bash script, which is a good candidate for an artifact. It's a self-contained piece of code that can be reused and modified. I'll create a new artifact for this script.</antThinking>\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"ssh-login-script\" type=\"application/vnd.ant.code\" language=\"bash\" title=\"SSH Login Script\">\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Check if the password environment variable is set\nif [ -z \"$SSH_PASSWORD\" ]; then\n    echo \"Error: SSH_PASSWORD environment variable is not set.\"\n    exit 1\nfi\n\n# Use sshpass to login with the password from the environment variable\nsshpass -p \"$SSH_PASSWORD\" ssh danny@178.79.189.240\n</antArtifact>\n\nTo use this script:\n\n1. First, set the environment variable for your password:\n\n```bash\nexport SSH_PASSWORD=\"your_actual_password_here\"\n```\n\n2. Save the script above to a file, for example, `ssh_login.sh`.\n\n3. Make the script executable:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x ssh_login.sh\n```\n\n4. Run the script:\n\n```bash\n./ssh_login.sh\n```\n\nImportant security notes:\n\n1. Storing passwords in environment variables is not the most secure method. It's better to use SSH keys for authentication.\n\n2. The script uses `sshpass`, which you may need to install on your system. On Ubuntu or Debian, you can install it with:\n\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt-get install sshpass\n   ```\n\n3. Be cautious when using `sshpass` as it can expose your password, especially in multi-user systems.\n\n4. Never share scripts containing sensitive information like passwords.\n\n5. Consider using SSH key-based authentication instead, which is more secure.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of this script or process in more detail?",
