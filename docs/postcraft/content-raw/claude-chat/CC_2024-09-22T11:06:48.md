  "text": " To address the TypeScript error you're encountering, we need to modify the type definition file for the readable-stream package. This error typically occurs when a computed property name is used in an ambient context (like a .d.ts file) and doesn't refer to a literal type or unique symbol.\n\nHere's how we can fix this:\n\n1. First, locate the file `node_modules/@types/readable-stream/index.d.ts`.\n\n2. Open the file and navigate to line 143.\n\n3. The problematic code is likely a computed property name. We need to change it to a non-computed property name or ensure it refers to a literal type.\n\n4. Without seeing the exact code, a general fix might look like this:\n\n```typescript\n// Before (example of problematic code)\n{\n  [Symbol.asyncIterator](): AsyncIterableIterator<any>;\n}\n\n// After (possible fix)\n{\n  '[Symbol.asyncIterator]': () => AsyncIterableIterator<any>;\n}\n```\n\n5. Save the file after making the changes.\n\n6. Rebuild your project to see if the error is resolved.\n\nIf this doesn't solve the issue, we may need to see more context around the problematic code to provide a more specific solution.\n\nQ1: Can you provide more details about the project structure and how you're using readable-stream?\nQ2: Are you using any specific version of TypeScript or @types/readable-stream?\nQ3: Have you encountered any other TypeScript errors related to this package?",

  "text": " I understand you're encountering an issue with workspaces in Pulsar, specifically that a workspace filter is set but no workspace folder is present. This could indicate a configuration problem or a mismatch between your project setup and Pulsar's workspace settings. Let's address this step by step:\n\n1. Check Pulsar configuration:\n   Verify that your Pulsar settings are correctly configured for workspaces.\n\n2. Verify project structure:\n   Ensure your project folders are organized as expected for a workspace setup.\n\n3. Review workspace filter:\n   Double-check the workspace filter settings to make sure they match your project structure.\n\n4. Clear workspace cache:\n   Try clearing Pulsar's workspace cache to force a refresh.\n\n5. Recreate workspace:\n   If the issue persists, try removing the workspace configuration and recreating it from scratch.\n\nWithout more specific details about your project structure and Pulsar configuration, it's challenging to provide a more targeted solution. If you need further assistance, please provide more information about your project setup and any relevant configuration files.\n\nQ1: Can you describe your project structure and how you've set up your workspace in Pulsar?\nQ2: Are you using any specific Pulsar packages or extensions related to workspace management?\nQ3: Have you recently made any changes to your project structure or Pulsar configuration that might have triggered this issue?",
