In computing and library science, it refers to the assembly of written information into a standard order, often used for organizing books, manuscripts, or character encoding.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on either of these definitions?",

John Sorter, a former librarian turned special agent, must use his unparalleled skills in data organization to stop a global conspiracy threatening to scramble the world's knowledge. Armed with nothing but his wit, a state-of-the-art tablet, and an unbreakable will to alphabetize, John races against time to collate the scattered pieces of a doomsday algorithm. \"Collation Day\" - where every misplaced file could mean the end of civilization as we know it.\n\nThe poster features a minimalist design with a large, red triangle symbolizing both danger and organization (like a filing system). The protagonist's name, John Sorter, is prominently displayed, emphasizing his role as the central figure bringing order to chaos. The color scheme of black, red, and white creates a stark, dramatic effect fitting for an action thriller.",
