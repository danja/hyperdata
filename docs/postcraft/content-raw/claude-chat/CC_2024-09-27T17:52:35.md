Reusability for other GraphQL endpoints:\n   - Core concepts and request handling are transferable\n   - GitHub-specific features would need to be abstracted away\n\nFor more general GraphQL use, consider:\n\n1. graphql-request: Lightweight, flexible GraphQL client\n2. Apollo Client: Full-featured GraphQL client with caching\n\nThese are more agnostic and could be better for building general-purpose GraphQL processors.\n\nQ1: Are you planning to interact with multiple GraphQL APIs beyond GitHub?\nQ2: Do you need advanced features like caching or state management in your GraphQL interactions?\nQ3: How important is minimizing the learning curve across different API interactions in your project?",
