  "text": " Yes, early model iPhones do use SIM cards, similar to Android phones. Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, and from the first generation up through the iPhone 13 series (released in 2021), all iPhone models used physical SIM cards.\n\nThe main differences in SIM card usage between early iPhones and Android phones were:\n\n1. Size: Early iPhones used standard SIM cards, then transitioned to micro-SIM with the iPhone 4, and finally to nano-SIM with the iPhone 5.\n\n2. Placement: In iPhones, the SIM card tray is typically located on the side of the device, while in many Android phones, it might be under the battery or in various other locations depending on the manufacturer and model.\n\nIt's worth noting that more recent iPhone models, starting with the iPhone 14 series in 2022, have begun to transition away from physical SIM cards in some markets (particularly the US), instead using eSIM technology exclusively. However, this change doesn't apply to the early models you asked about.",
