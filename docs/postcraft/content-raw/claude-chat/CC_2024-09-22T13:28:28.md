  "text": " In UK English slang, \"tasty\" can have a few different meanings beyond its literal sense of something being delicious:\n\n1. Attractive or good-looking: It's often used to describe an attractive person, especially in a somewhat casual or cheeky way. For example, \"That new bartender is pretty tasty!\"\n\n2. Impressive or excellent: It can be used to describe something that's particularly good or impressive. For instance, \"Did you see his new car? It's a tasty little number!\"\n\n3. Difficult or challenging: In some contexts, particularly related to sports or confrontations, \"tasty\" can mean tough or potentially violent. For example, \"The match is going to be tasty - the two teams really don't like each other.\"\n\n4. Expensive or high-quality: Sometimes it's used to describe something that's of high value or quality. \"He's got a tasty job in the City\" might mean a well-paying job in London's financial district.\n\n5. Risky or dangerous: In certain contexts, it might describe a situation that's potentially hazardous or tricky. \"Things got a bit tasty when the police showed up at the party.\"\n\nThe exact meaning often depends on the context in which it's used. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these uses or provide more examples?",

  "text": " While \"tasty\" isn't as commonly used as slang in American English compared to British English, it does have some slang usages in the US as well. Here are a few ways it might be used in US slang:\n\n1. Attractive or sexy: Similar to the UK usage, it can describe an attractive person. For example, \"That new actor in the movie is pretty tasty.\"\n\n2. Cool or impressive: It might be used to describe something that's particularly good or impressive, though this is less common than in UK slang. \"Check out his new guitar - it's a tasty piece of gear.\"\n\n3. Lucrative or profitable: In business contexts, a \"tasty deal\" might refer to a very profitable opportunity.\n\n4. Exciting or intense: In sports or competitive contexts, a \"tasty matchup\" could mean an exciting or intense competition.\n\n5. Risky or dangerous: Though less common, it can sometimes be used to describe a risky situation, similar to the UK usage.\n\nIt's worth noting that these slang uses are generally less prevalent and may be considered a bit dated in US English compared to UK English. In the US, \"tasty\" is more commonly used in its literal sense to describe food. The slang uses, when they do occur, are often influenced by media or cultural crossover from the UK.\n\nWould you like me to expand on any of these points or provide more context about slang differences between US and UK English?",
