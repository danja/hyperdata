  "text": " Certainly. Here's a step-by-step guide to refactor your codebase to implement the \"Transformers\" naming convention:\n\n1. Rename the directory:\n   ```\n   mv src/services src/transformers\n   ```\n\n2. Update the base class:\n   Rename `Service.js` to `Transformer.js` and update its content:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // src/transformers/base/Transformer.js\n   import { EventEmitter } from 'events'\n\n   class Transformer extends EventEmitter {\n     // ... existing code ...\n     \n     async process(message) {\n       throw new Error('execute method not implemented')\n     }\n   }\n\n   export default Transformer\n   ```\n\n3. Update all subclasses:\n   For each file in `src/transformers`, update the import and class name:\n\n   ```javascript\n   import Transformer from '../base/Transformer.js'\n\n   class SomeTransformer extends Transformer {\n     // ... existing code ...\n   }\n\n   export default SomeTransformer\n   ```\n\n4. Update the factory:\n   Rename `ServicesFactory.js` to `TransformerFactory.js` and update its content:\n\n   ```javascript\n   // src/engine/TransformerFactory.js\n   import logger from '../utils/Logger.js'\n   import ns from '../utils/ns.js'\n   // Update other imports...\n\n   class TransformerFactory {\n     static createTransformer(type, config) {\n       // ... existing code, replacing 'createService' with 'createTransformer' ...\n     }\n   }\n\n   export default TransformerFactory\n   ```\n\n5. Update the main execution logic:\n   In files like `Transmission.js` or wherever you're using these components, update the terminology:\n\n   ```javascript\n   import TransformerFactory from './TransformerFactory.js'\n\n   class Transmission {\n     constructor() {\n       this.transformers = {}\n     }\n\n     register(transformerName, instance) {\n       this.transformers[transformerName] = instance\n     }\n\n     // ... other methods ...\n   }\n   ```\n\n6. Update configuration files:\n   If you have any configuration files (like `transmission.ttl`), update the terminology there as well.\n\n7. Search and replace:\n   Do a project-wide search for \"service\" and \"Service\" and replace with \"transformer\" and \"Transformer\" respectively, being careful not to change unrelated occurrences.\n\n8. Update documentation and comments to reflect the new terminology.\n\nRemember to thoroughly test your system after making these changes to ensure everything still works as expected.\n\nQ1: Would you like guidance on updating any specific part of this refactoring process?\nQ2: Are there any areas in your codebase where the term \"service\" might be used in a different context that should be preserved?\nQ3: How do you plan to communicate this terminology change to your team or users?",
