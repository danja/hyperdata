  "text": " To copy files from a failing hard drive in Linux while skipping problematic ones, you can use the `rsync` command with specific options. Here's a command that should work well for your situation:\n\n```\nrsync -avP --ignore-errors /source/directory/ /destination/directory/\n```\n\nLet me break down the options:\n\n- `-a`: Archive mode, which preserves permissions, timestamps, etc.\n- `-v`: Verbose mode, so you can see what's happening.\n- `-P`: Combines the `--progress` and `--partial` options. It shows progress during transfer and keeps partially transferred files.\n- `--ignore-errors`: This is key for your situation. It tells rsync to continue copying even if it encounters errors.\n\nReplace `/source/directory/` with the path to the failing drive or the directory you want to copy, and `/destination/directory/` with where you want to copy the files to.\n\nThis command will attempt to copy all files, skipping over those it can't read without stopping the entire process. It will also show you the progress, which can be helpful when dealing with a large number of files or a slow, failing drive.\n\nWould you like me to explain more about this command or provide any additional information about data recovery in Linux?",
