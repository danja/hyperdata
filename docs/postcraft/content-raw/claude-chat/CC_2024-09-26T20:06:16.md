  "text": " I see. This error occurs because webpack is trying to bundle Node.js core modules like 'fs/promises', which are not available in browser environments. To resolve this, we need to configure webpack to ignore Node.js core modules. Here's how to fix it:\n\n1. Install the `webpack-node-externals` package:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev webpack-node-externals\n```\n\n2.

  "text": " I see you're encountering an issue with the 'assert' module, which is another Node.js core module. This suggests that some of your dependencies might be using Node.js specific modules. Let's address this:\n\n1. First, we need to provide a browser-compatible version of 'assert'. Install the following package:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev assert\n```\n\n2. Update your webpack.config.mjs to include fallbacks for Node.js core modules:\n\n```javascript\nimport path from 'path';\nimport { fileURLToPath } from 'url';\n\nconst __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);\nconst __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);\n\nexport default {\n  entry: './src/index.js',\n  output: {\n    filename: 'bundle.js',\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),\n  },\n  target: 'web',\n  resolve: {\n    extensions: ['.js', '.json'],\n    fallback: {\n      \"assert\": require.resolve(\"assert/\"),\n      \"fs\": false,\n      \"path\": require.resolve(\"path-browserify\"),\n      \"stream\": require.resolve(\"stream-browserify\")\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\n3. Install the additional polyfills:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev path-browserify stream-browserify\n```\n\n4. You might also need to add a plugin to provide process and buffer:\n\n```\nnpm install --save-dev process buffer\n```\n\nThen add this to your webpack config:\n\n```javascript\nimport webpack from 'webpack';\n\n// ... previous config ...\n\nplugins: [\n  new webpack.ProvidePlugin({\n    process: 'process/browser',\n    Buffer: ['buffer', 'Buffer']\n  })\n]\n```\n\nThese changes should resolve most Node.js core module issues for browser bundling.\n\nQ1: Are you using any specific features of 'https-proxy-agent' that require Node.js environment?\nQ2: Can you share more about the overall purpose of your application? This might help identify if there are better browser-compatible alternatives for what you're trying to achieve.\nQ3: Are there any other dependencies in your package.json that are typically used in Node.js environments?",
