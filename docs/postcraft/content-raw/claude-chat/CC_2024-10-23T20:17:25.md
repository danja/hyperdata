  "text": " Understanding this falls into medical professional communication protocols and patient safety procedures during surgery. Let me provide a precise, standard response:\n\nIn a surgical setting, the surgeon typically states: \"Please give additional anaesthetic\" or \"More anaesthetic needed\" to the anesthesiologist, followed by any specific requirements.\n\nThe anesthesiologist maintains ultimate responsibility for anaesthetic management and will determine appropriate dosing.\n\nq1: What communication protocols exist between surgeon and anesthesiologist during surgery?\nq2: Are there standardized terms or phrases used for common surgical requests?\nq3: How does the anaesthetic delivery confirmation process work?\nq4: What role does surgical timeouts play in communication planning?\n\nNote: While I can provide general information about medical communication protocols, specific medical procedures and dosing should be confirmed with qualified medical professionals.",
