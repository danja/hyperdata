  "text": " Paying a hundredth (1/100 or 1%) would be called a \"centesimal\" if we were to follow a similar naming convention as \"tithe.\"\n\nThe word \"tithe\" comes from an Old English word meaning \"tenth.\" While \"centesimal\" isn't commonly used in religious or financial contexts like \"tithe\" is, it's the mathematically correct term for a hundredth part.\n\nIn practical usage, a payment of 1% might simply be referred to as \"one percent\" or a \"percentage\" rather than having a specific term like tithe.",

  "text": " To form a verb from \"centesimal\" that's comparable to \"to tithe,\" we would use the process of back-formation. This is the same process by which \"to tithe\" was derived from \"tithe.\"\n\nThe verb form would be \"to centesimate.\"\n\nSo, just as you might say:\n\"The church tithes its members\" (meaning the church requires members to pay a tenth)\n\nYou could say:\n\"The organization centesimates its members\" (meaning the organization requires members to pay a hundredth)\n\nIt's worth noting that while \"to centesimate\" is grammatically correct and follows the logical pattern, it's not a commonly used term. In fact, it would be considered a neologism (a newly coined word) in this context. In practical usage, people would more likely say something like \"to charge one percent\" or \"to impose a one-percent fee.\"",

  "text": " For a thousandth (1/1000 or 0.1%), we can follow the same pattern:\n\n1. The noun form would be \"millesimal,\" which means \"consisting of thousandths\" or \"a thousandth part.\"\n\n2. The verb form, following the same back-formation process, would be \"to millesimate.\"\n\nSo you could theoretically say:\n\"The organization millesimates its members\" (meaning the organization requires members to pay a thousandth or 0.1%)\n\nAgain, it's important to note that while \"millesimal\" is a real mathematical term, its use as a verb in this context would be extremely rare and likely considered a neologism. In practical usage, people would typically say something like \"to charge one-tenth of a percent\" or \"to impose a 0.1% fee.\"\n\nThis follows the pattern we've established:\n\n- Tenth (10%) = tithe / to tithe\n- Hundredth (1%) = centesimal / to centesimate\n- Thousandth (0.1%) = millesimal / to millesimate\n\nThese terms become progressively more obscure and less likely to be used in everyday language as the fractions get smaller.",
