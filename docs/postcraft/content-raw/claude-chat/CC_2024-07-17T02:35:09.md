  "text": " This error message indicates that there were issues building installable wheels for two Python packages: patchelf and ninja. Wheels are pre-built distribution packages for Python that can be installed quickly without needing to compile the source code.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you could try the following steps:\n\n1. Ensure you have the latest version of pip, setuptools, and wheel:\n\n```\npip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel\n```\n\n2. Install the build dependencies for these packages:\n\n```\npip install build\n```\n\n3. Try installing the packages individually to see more detailed error messages:\n\n```\npip install patchelf\npip install ninja\n```\n\n4. If you're on Linux, make sure you have the necessary development tools installed:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\n```\n\n5. If you're still having issues, you might need to install these packages from source:\n\n```\npip install --no-binary :all: patchelf ninja\n```\n\nIf you're still encountering problems after trying these steps, it would be helpful to see the full error output. There might be more specific issues related to your system or environment that are causing the build to fail.\n\nWould you like me to explain any of these steps in more detail or provide additional information about building Python packages?",
