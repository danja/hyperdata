  "text": "I'd like to build a small indoor mobile robot which will be controlled by a microcontroller. The design around the control and drive are not relevant right now. What I'd like you to help me with is sensors. A first job for the robot will be to locate cold spots and sources of  drafts in a room. Budget limits mean thermal cameras are not an option. What sensors might be useful for this purpose?",
