  "text": " It seems like you've taken some steps to remove the sensitive information, but GitHub is still detecting the API key in your repository's history. This is because Git keeps a record of all previous commits, even if you've deleted the files or reverted the commits. Here's what you can do to resolve this issue:\n\n1. First, let's make sure your local repository is up-to-date:\n\n   ```\n   git fetch origin\n   git pull origin main  # or whatever your branch name is\n   ```\n\n2. Now, we need to remove the sensitive information from your Git history. One way to do this is using the `git filter-branch` command. However, GitHub recommends using the BFG Repo-Cleaner tool as it's faster and simpler. Here's how you can use it:\n\n   a. Download the BFG Repo-Cleaner from https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/\n   \n   b. Move the downloaded jar file to your repository's parent directory.\n   \n   c. Create a file named `secrets.txt` in your repository's parent directory and add your API key to it (one per line).\n   \n   d. Run the BFG tool:\n\n   ```\n   java -jar bfg-1.14.0.jar --replace-text secrets.txt my-repo.git\n   ```\n\n   Replace `bfg-1.14.0.jar` with the actual filename of the BFG jar you downloaded.\n\n3. After running BFG, your repository's history should be cleaned. Now you need to force push these changes:\n\n   ```\n   git push origin --force --all\n   ```\n\n4. If you have any tags that might contain the sensitive data, force push them as well:\n\n   ```\n   git push origin --force --tags\n   ```\n\n5. Finally, it's crucial to change your API key immediately, as it should be considered compromised.\n\nRemember, this process rewrites your Git history, which can cause issues if others have already cloned or forked your repository. Make sure to communicate with your team if this is a shared project.\n\nIf you're still encountering issues after following these steps, you might need to contact GitHub support for further assistance.\n\nWould you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?",
