  "text": " I believe you might be referring to the idiom \"a hawk eye\" or \"hawk-eyed.\" This expression means having very keen eyesight or being exceptionally observant.\n\nThe idiom comes from the fact that hawks are known for their exceptionally sharp vision, which allows them to spot prey from great distances. When used to describe a person, it suggests they are very attentive to detail or quick to notice things.\n\nFor example, you might say:\n\"The editor has a hawk eye for grammatical errors.\"\n\"With her hawk-eyed attention to detail, she quickly spotted the discrepancy in the financial report.\"\n\nIs this the idiom you were thinking of? If not, I'd be happy to help you find the correct one if you can provide any additional details.",

  "text": " Certainly! There are a few other idioms related to eyes or vision that might be similar to what you're thinking of. Here are some possibilities:\n\n1. \"Eagle eye\" - Very similar to \"hawk eye,\" meaning keen vision or great attention to detail.\n\n2. \"Bird's eye view\" - A view from high above, giving a comprehensive perspective.\n\n3. \"Keep an eye out\" - To watch carefully for something.\n\n4. \"Eyes like a lynx\" - Having very sharp eyesight (less common than hawk or eagle).\n\n5. \"Eyes in the back of one's head\" - The ability to perceive what's happening behind you; often used for parents or teachers who seem to know what children are doing even when not looking.\n\n6. \"Eye of the tiger\" - Intense focus and determination (though this is more about attitude than vision).\n\n7. \"Bull's eye\" - Hitting the exact center of a target; used metaphorically for achieving a goal precisely.\n\n8. \"Cat's eye\" - Sometimes used to describe keen night vision.\n\nIf none of these seem right, could you provide any more context or information about how the idiom is used? That might help narrow it down further.",

  "text": " Ah, now I understand why you mentioned \"hen\" in your initial question. There are a few chicken-related idioms that might be what you're looking for:\n\n1. \"Chicken eye\" - This isn't a common idiom, but it's sometimes used to describe poor eyesight, as chickens don't have particularly good vision.\n\n2. \"Hen's teeth\" - This idiom means something very rare or scarce, as in \"That kind of opportunity is as scarce as hen's teeth.\" (Hens don't have teeth, making this a humorous way to say something is extremely rare.)\n\n3. \"Eagle-eyed\" - While not chicken-related, this is another bird-related idiom meaning very observant or having keen eyesight.\n\n4. \"Cock-eyed\" - This means askew, crooked, or absurd. It can also mean having a squint or crossed eyes.\n\n5. \"Chicken-hearted\" - While not related to eyes, this idiom means cowardly or easily frightened.\n\n6. \"Hen-pecked\" - Also not eye-related, but it describes a man who is constantly nagged or dominated by his wife.\n\nIs it possible you were thinking of one of these, or perhaps combining \"chicken\" with another eye-related idiom? If none of these fit, could you provide any more context about how the idiom is used or what it means?",
