  "text": " I understand you want to create a \"Context Window Basket\" by combining RDF vocabularies in Turtle syntax, along with a system prompt for efficient use with LLMs. I'll provide a prompt and pseudocode for this setup. Let's start with the prompt:\n\n<antThinking>This task requires creating a substantial, reusable piece of content (the prompt and pseudocode) that the user might want to modify or iterate on. It's self-contained and likely to be referenced multiple times. This makes it a good candidate for an artifact.</antThinking>\n\n<antArtifact identifier=\"context-window-basket-prompt\" type=\"text/markdown\" title=\"Context Window Basket: Prompt and Pseudocode\">\n# Context Window Basket: System Prompt\n\nYou are an AI assistant specialized in working with RDF vocabularies. You have been provided with a condensed set of RDF vocabularies in Turtle syntax, optimized for efficient use within the context window. Your task is to interpret, utilize, and explain these vocabularies as needed. When referencing or using these vocabularies:\n\n1. Prioritize the most relevant terms and concepts for the given query.\n2. Use prefixes to keep responses concise while maintaining clarity.\n3. Explain any terms or relationships that might not be immediately clear to users unfamiliar with the specific vocabularies.\n4. Be prepared to expand on any part of the vocabularies if requested.\n\nRemember, the provided vocabularies are optimized for context window efficiency. If you need more detailed information about a specific term or relationship, please ask for clarification.\n\n# Pseudocode for Combining RDF Vocabularies\n\n```\nfunction createContextWindowBasket(files, outputFile):\n    Initialize empty set prefixes\n    Initialize empty set triples\n    \n    for each file in files:\n        content = readFile(file)\n        filePrefix, fileTriples = parseRdfTurtle(content)\n        Add filePrefix to prefixes\n        Add fileTriples to triples\n    \n    optimizedPrefixes = optimizePrefixes(prefixes)\n    optimizedTriples = optimizeTriples(triples)\n    \n    combinedContent = formatTurtle(optimizedPrefixes, optimizedTriples)\n    writeFile(outputFile, combinedContent)\n\nfunction parseRdfTurtle(content):\n    Extract prefixes from content\n    Extract triples from content\n    return prefixes, triples\n\nfunction optimizePrefixes(prefixes):\n    Remove duplicate prefixes\n    Shorten prefix URIs where possible\n    return optimizedPrefixes\n\nfunction optimizeTriples(triples):\n    Remove duplicate triples\n    Simplify complex structures where possible\n    Prioritize most commonly used terms and relationships\n    return optimizedTriples\n\nfunction formatTurtle(prefixes, triples):\n    Format prefixes in Turtle syntax\n    Format triples in Turtle syntax\n    Combine formatted prefixes and triples\n    return formattedContent\n\n# Main execution\ninputFiles = [file1.ttl, file2.ttl, file3.ttl, ...]\noutputFile = \"context_window_basket.ttl\"\ncreateContextWindowBasket(inputFiles, outputFile)\n```\n\nThis pseudocode outlines the process of combining multiple RDF vocabulary files in Turtle syntax into a single, optimized file for use in LLM context windows. The main steps include:\n\n1. Reading and parsing each input file\n2. Extracting and optimizing prefixes and triples\n3. Removing duplicates and simplifying structures\n4. Prioritizing commonly used terms and relationships\n5. Formatting the optimized content back into Turtle syntax\n6. Writing the result to a single output file\n\nTo use this setup effectively, you would implement the pseudocode in your preferred programming language, adjusting as needed for specific requirements or optimizations.\n</antArtifact>\n\nI've created a prompt and pseudocode for your Context Window Basket setup. The prompt provides guidance for an AI assistant on how to work with the optimized RDF vocabularies, while the pseudocode outlines the process of combining and optimizing the vocabulary files.\n\nTo implement this, you would need to:\n\n1. Write actual code based on the pseudocode, using your preferred programming language.\n2. Gather your RDF vocabulary files in Turtle syntax.\n3. Run the implemented code to generate your optimized \"context_window_basket.ttl\" file.\n4. Use the generated file along with the provided prompt when interacting with LLM tools.\n\nThis approach should help you efficiently use RDF vocabularies within LLM context windows without wasting space. Would you like me to explain any part of this setup in more detail?",
