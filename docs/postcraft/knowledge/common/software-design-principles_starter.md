# Software Design Principles and Best Practices

## Core Design Philosophy
- Consider code from the reader's perspective, not just the writer's
- Invest in good design early - it pays off quickly
- Question and understand why you disagree with design advice
- Consider multiple design approaches for major decisions

## Complexity Management
### Indicators to Monitor
- Change amplification (changes requiring multiple modifications)
- Cognitive load (knowledge required for tasks)
- Unknown unknowns (unclear modification requirements)

### Prevention Strategies
- Design deep modules with simple interfaces
- Implement sensible defaults for common cases
- Minimize exception handling points
- Make module interfaces obvious to users

## Implementation Guidelines
### Documentation
- Document rationale behind decisions
- Focus on cross-module interactions
- Place documentation where developers will find it
- Write clear comments for non-obvious code

### Code Quality
- Maintain consistency in coding conventions
- Automate style enforcement (ESLint, Prettier)
- Follow existing team conventions
- Think strategic, not just tactical

### Testing Requirements
- Implement comprehensive unit tests
- Use tests to enable safe refactoring
- Ensure high code coverage
- Create tests before performance optimization

### Performance Optimization
- Measure and benchmark before optimizing
- Focus on critical path bottlenecks
- Validate performance improvements
- Document performance-related decisions

## Success Metrics
- Code reusability
- Maintenance efficiency
- Development enjoyment
- Bug reduction
- Clear upgrade paths
