# Hyperdata Namespaces

**Status 2024-10-08** - setting up (prompted by need for the Pivot vocab)

This will be the new home for [hyperdata](https://hyperdata.it) namespace documents, specifications and the like.

Anything remotely mature will be given a PURL under http://purl.org/stuff which will be the permanent canonical namespace reference. This is also recommended for links and references as it should (best-effort) always point to the most recent version of documents and is much less likely to drop off the Web.

Right now such things are under https://hyperdata.it/xmlns but will migrate here asap. (I will strive to keep those URLs Cool and crosslink as appropriate).

Any new material will start here.

Pivot is new.
