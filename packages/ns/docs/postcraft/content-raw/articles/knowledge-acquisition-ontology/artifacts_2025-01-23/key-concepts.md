# Key Concepts in Implicit Knowledge Capture

## Temporal Correlation [TC]
**Summary**: Knowledge patterns derived from temporal proximity of actions or events.
**Description**: Temporal correlation analyzes the timing relationships between discrete events to infer potential semantic connections. This includes both immediate sequence patterns and longer-term periodic behaviors. Links to Information Foraging Theory [IFT] patterns and Activity Theory [AT] temporal aspects.

## Associative Learning [AL]
**Summary**: Pattern recognition through repeated co-occurrence of elements.
**Description**: The process by which relationships between elements are learned through their repeated co-occurrence or sequential presentation. Builds implicit knowledge networks without explicit classification. Strong connections to Neural Networks [NN] and Statistical Learning Theory [SLT].

## Implicit Intent [II]
**Summary**: Unstated purposes and goals inferred from observable actions.
**Description**: The extraction of user goals and intentions from behavioral traces without explicit declaration. Relates to both Activity Theory [AT] goal structures and Information Foraging Theory [IFT] information scent concepts.

## Context Networks [CN]
**Summary**: Emergent relationship graphs between discrete knowledge elements.
**Description**: Networks of relationships that emerge from analyzing patterns of user interaction with information objects. Forms basis for Knowledge Discovery [KD] and relates to Graph Theory [GT] applications.

## Behavioral Traces [BT]
**Summary**: Digital footprints left by user interactions with systems.
**Description**: The collection of observable actions and choices made during system interaction. Primary data source for Pattern Mining [PM] and basis for User Modeling [UM].

## Semantic Drift [SD]
**Summary**: Evolution of meaning and relationships over time.
**Description**: How implicit knowledge relationships and meanings change through continued interaction and accumulation of behavioral traces. Connected to Concept Drift [CD] in machine learning.

## Pattern Mining [PM]
**Summary**: Extraction of recurring behavioral and relationship patterns.
**Description**: Techniques for identifying and extracting meaningful patterns from behavioral traces and temporal sequences. Fundamental to Knowledge Discovery [KD] processes.

## Knowledge Crystallization [KC]
**Summary**: Process of converting implicit patterns into explicit knowledge structures.
**Description**: Methods and techniques for transforming discovered patterns and relationships into formal knowledge representations. Links to Knowledge Representation [KR] frameworks.
