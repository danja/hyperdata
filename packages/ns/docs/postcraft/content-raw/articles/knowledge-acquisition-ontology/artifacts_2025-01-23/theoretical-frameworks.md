# Theoretical Frameworks for Implicit Knowledge Analysis

## Activity Theory [AT]
**Summary**: Framework for analyzing human activity through tool mediation.
**Description**: Theoretical framework examining how human activities are mediated by tools and social contexts. Provides structure for understanding Implicit Intent [II] and Behavioral Traces [BT]. Key concepts include activity hierarchies and tool mediation patterns.

## Information Foraging Theory [IFT]
**Summary**: Model of information seeking and gathering behaviors.
**Description**: Theoretical framework applying optimal foraging theory to information seeking behavior. Explains patterns in Temporal Correlation [TC] and Context Networks [CN]. Central concepts include information scent and patch assessment.

## Knowledge Discovery in Databases [KDD]
**Summary**: Systematic approach to finding patterns in large datasets.
**Description**: Framework for extracting meaningful patterns from behavioral and interaction data. Directly supports Pattern Mining [PM] and Knowledge Crystallization [KC]. Connected to Statistical Learning Theory [SLT].

## Statistical Learning Theory [SLT]
**Summary**: Mathematical framework for machine learning from data.
**Description**: Theoretical foundation for learning patterns and relationships from observed data. Underlies many Pattern Mining [PM] techniques and supports Associative Learning [AL] mechanisms.

## Graph Theory [GT]
**Summary**: Mathematical study of network structures and relationships.
**Description**: Theoretical basis for analyzing and representing relationship networks. Essential for understanding Context Networks [CN] and Knowledge Crystallization [KC] processes.

## Concept Drift Theory [CD]
**Summary**: Framework for understanding how patterns and relationships evolve.
**Description**: Theoretical approach to analyzing how learned patterns and relationships change over time. Related to Semantic Drift [SD] and temporal aspects of Knowledge Discovery [KDD].

## User Modeling [UM]
**Summary**: Framework for representing user characteristics and behaviors.
**Description**: Theoretical approach to modeling user behavior, preferences, and patterns. Builds on Behavioral Traces [BT] and supports Implicit Intent [II] analysis.

## Knowledge Representation [KR]
**Summary**: Frameworks for formally representing knowledge and relationships.
**Description**: Theoretical foundations for representing both explicit and implicit knowledge. Essential for Knowledge Crystallization [KC] and Context Networks [CN] formalization.
