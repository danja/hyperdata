# More form-a-matic dev

TODO render JSON representation to markmap

I tweaked the form-a-matic code, the core stuff is now basically working. The JSON out is now looking much like another RDF serialization, so I went to check on the [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) syntaxes. There isn't one *very* close, so I reckon I'll continue as-is.
